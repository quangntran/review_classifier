"If there ever was a film to show the art of cinema ""The Godfather"" is it. The visceral, dirty feeling through out the film shows the fantastic direction of Coppola and magnificent acting from Al Pacino, James Caan and Marlon Brando.",positive
The Godfather is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. I love the opening sequence. The drama and the crime is what really makes this movie phenomenal.,positive
Masterpiece!the way it was presented is phenomenal the slow screenplay the Music and the drama it was calm and dark at same time at start it was intro which was boring and way too slow then from the horse and johnny scene it was amazing ride!acting was iconic every one were amazing!ending was great the way mike turned his fate to no shit for gangsters to The Godfather it was amazing!overall most iconic movie!,positive

Instant masterpiece,positive
"Going by Rotten Tomatoes description of what each star means, NO, it did not pass the time. This is my most controversial opinion, so odds are you disagree with me and that's fine. This movie was required viewing for me and I did my time. But that's all I felt it was for me. It wasn't entertaining, it didn't intrigue me, it was too slow and overlong at 3 hours, and I couldn't connect with the Italian mafia (least of all with Marlon Brando, who I believe to be at his laziest whenever aboard a Francis Ford Coppola set, like when I had to watch the superior ""Apocalypse Now""). The movie's well made and contains one or two surprising deaths, but the rest of the story's a predictable, albeit decently written, mess. I got lost during the wedding sequence, which isn't a good sign when it's the opening of the film. I watched the sequel as well out of obligation and it gets even worse. I'll never give a film a 0 because work was involved and care was clearly put into each film I've seen. For example, this one had luscious set designs. To put this into MY scale, I'd give it a 6/10 or 3 stars, but by RT standards, they say since it didn't pass the time and I didn't like it, if I'm being really honest with myself, it's a 1.5 star at best. Sorry, everyone. I know it's your favorite, but I'd rather watch Once Upon A Time In America (the original 4 hour cut) or if your gonna force Coppola on me (give me a movie directed by Sofia Coppola) or if I have to watch my favorite Francis Ford Coppola film it's surprisingly not even ""The 'underrated' Conversation"", but ""The Outsiders"". Can I leave the lecture room now? I did my 7 hours. I owed it to cinema history and I'll give it another go in a few years, but for now, adios.",negative
"This review may contain spoilers. 5 out of 5 for Marlon Brando's acting it was extraordinarily And about the movie the best mafia movie I have ever seen in my entire life lots of my friends told me to watch this movie for a long time, it a shame I didn't watch this movie this long The best scene in this movie which I like is that evil look of Al Pacino while the assassination of other Dons ""The Baptism Scene"" I really loved it",positive
"Haha trumptards now on this thread, angry about The Godfather - what a time to be alive",positive
"Sure one can appreciate what a piece represented for it's time and how it spawned derived works but this doesn't change the fact that ignoring sentimentality, this film doesn't hold up to the test of time.",negative
This is a rotten tomato.,negative
some best movies ever,positive
"One of the most beautiful pieces of cinematography I have ever laid my eyes upon. I loved this film entirely and thoroughly. The acting was incredible, I am well and truely in love with Al Pacino and want nothing more to be Kay Adams for a day. The Casting director for this film is highly qualified as they made perfectly clear in their divine selection of actors. The plot line was engaging, interesting, gripping, other synonyms for a bloody good story. The film has the perfect amount of violence, didn't go overboard and still managed to make their point. The cinematography of that baptism scene will stay with for a long time it was just beautiful. The lighting and the gold tinting and the baby in the lace - so graceful, so divine. I love this film.",positive
One of my favorite films ever and my favorite mob film,positive
Godfather & Godfather II are the greatest movies of all time!!!,positive
"The Godfather combines stunning cinematography with an intense yet surprisingly effective narrative. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give it their all, and superb acting is one of the movie's driving factors. The action is quite realistic, and the characters are layered and believable. The Godfather will forever be known as one of Hollywood's greatest achievements.",positive
"Sicilian Mafia working in America, the notorious head of the family, Don Corleone, fighting for the pride of the family. The epic mafia films pictured the mafia well, awesome.",positive
One of the greatest motion pictures in film history.,positive
"I liked the movie because It's a very realistic scheme of a gangster life. At least it seems. Furthermore, the principles of Vito Corleone inspired me a lot, as well as his capacity to dialogue with his rivals. He is a fearless man, that calculates every single step he and his family does, and never refuse a good proposal. Therefore, there's a lot of stuff we can admire from it.",positive
"This film isn't for everyone, I admit that. But for those who enjoy a good story but don't mind the wait to climax, WATCH THIS. The story is the portrayal of the fall from grace of Michael Corleone. Michael is a tragic hero. Caught between an innocent outside world and the criminal underground of his family, he makes decisions we would've made as well. The plotline and characters are worlds in themselves. The city itself serves as a backdrop into the fascinating world that makes this film so great. The violence is satisfying, the scenery and camera work beautiful. Every scene in this film was a work of curated art. Not to mention the church scene which is instantly a memorable movie scene. What I especially enjoyed in this film was the dedication to the original book that Mario Puzo wrote. Reading the book after watching the film made me appreciate the attention to detail. 5/5. Beautiful. A must watch.",positive
melhor filme que já assisti na minha vida,positive
It's better than the second one,positive
"This mob drama was really good. Marlon Brando and the rest of the cast did a spectacular job in this classic movie. The plot to the movie was great and some unexpected things happened that were kind of gruesome. Putting that aside, this movie is a definite must see. Kids shouldn't see this movie, but adults will enjoy it.",positive
The Greatest Movie of ALL TIME IMHO!!,positive
"Love this movie! A true classic, never gets old. It was even better seeing it on the big screen!",positive
An amazing classic gangster movie! Must watch!,positive
"The fact that this movie doesn't have 100% from everyone is a disservice to how amazing it is. The screenplay, the acting, the story, the scenery...I mean, this movie is about as flawless as one can be. You don't even need to enjoy ""gangster films"" or be intrigued by the Mafia to love it. It's an instant classic and everyone should watch it at least once. A cinematic masterpiece. I can't leave a long enough review to give it justice. If you haven't seen this yet or are on the fence about it, please watch it. You won't be disappointed. Don't let the over 3 hour play time scare you, it's worth it!",positive
"So many iconic scenes. I can't believe I've lived so long without watching this. It has definitely changed my view on filmography. By the end of the film, you won't believe you just watched a three-hour film because of how packed it is.",positive
"The Godfather is excellent Melo drama of crime film. About family, social, personal of our self about what should we do for protect the family and bring a punishment for bad people, and we also must teach a bad people with kindness not with violence.",positive
The greatest movie of all time!,positive
Without a doubt one of the greatest and most important films EVER made. But one begins to think if its “timely values” still quite hold up in this day and age? I guess only more time and vengeance will tell.,positive
He made me an offer I couldn't refuse.,positive
Peter Griffin Didn’t Like It But I Did,positive
"It uses every frame of its time to humanize then destroy a family, making their trade and income unimportant, and changing the world of film in the process. The best ever, period.",positive
"You generally review a movie with an additive mentality, where every good aspect you acknowledge contributes to add up to the final score. In the case of universally acclaimed movies such as this one, it's the opposite: you try to find flaws that can reduce a preconceived 5-star rating that social pressure creates. Well, there are no flaws here to be found. And if I missed them, rest assured that this epic crime drama has so much to offer that they wouldn't matter. Memorable actors, brilliant direction, groundbreaking lighting, compelling screenplay, evocative soundtrack. It's a three-hour journey that manages to feel too short, leaving you craving for more. The movie deals with so many themes that you could write books about it, and so they did. People study this movie, and for good reasons.",positive
98 percent this the best movie ever made. I’ve watched and loved it at least twenty times.,positive
The Godfather possibly the greatest movie ever made,positive
This is the greatest American Film ever created. Prove me wrong,positive
"This movie is Ford Coppola at his iconic, captivating and world building best. Vito Corleone is such an intriguing and interesting character to see on screen, which is just one of the many reasons that this 2h 57m runtime flies by.",positive
One of the greatest films I've ever seen!,positive
What more is there to say?,positive
This is a nearly perfectly told story of engrossing characters wrapped up in mafioso drama.,positive
It's a pretty fucking boring movie at times. but i enjoyed it,negative
It's truly a masterpiece,positive
"A classic must watch. Lots of mobsters, lots of killing, great acting, solid characters, and amazing music. My only complaint is that at times it was hard to hear what was being said in certain scenes when listening at a reasonable volume.",positive

Outstanding in just about every way possible.,positive
One of the greatest films ever made. Marlon Brando shines as Vito Corleone with Al Pacino amazing the world as Michael Corleone.

One of the top 10 best movies ever (IMHO). I love it. Can't get enough.,positive

Do I really need to explain myself?,positive
"Seriously, so sublime it's boring. Post WW2 gangster family doings.",positive
The best movie I have watched. Brando and Pacino's performances are exhilarating. I have been given life by this movie,positive
One of the best films of all time everyone would have to agree.,positive
una maravilla de la cinematografia,positive
"One of the best movies of all time if I might say, great story, development of characters; especially Michael. Also has just the right amount of action to keep you on your toes.",positive
Definitely not the story I was expecting. The interpersonal relationships seemed realistic and the lack of foreshadowing most deaths certainly added to that. It was a little long and didn't feel like all questions were answered.,positive
Perfect movie!!! I highly recommend!,positive
"The best movies about italian Mafia, perfect Trilogy.",positive
"Truly perfection. The all-star cast, brilliant music and story. A painfully beautiful story about Michael Corleone, a tragic hero. The excellent cinematography is truly groundbreaking. Many criticisms of certain aspects being cliche are false, since they were new in the film. 10/10.",positive

I cannot add to the generations of critics whose analysis explains how and why this movie works-- the acting and casting, the script and characterization, the cinematography and music, the famous montage, even the subsequent sequels... I can understand and find a place of compassion in my heart for both the father and the son as they progress through their diverging dramatic arcs.",positive
"Will always be the number one, the one to beat!",positive
"I enjoyed the movie when it came out, even if I thought it was too long and I didn't care for the choice of color palette in the photography, particularly the parts showing the young godfather in NYC. I saw it first at age 21, as an older adult I have more of an appreciation of how it was made.",positive
The best movie of all time,positive
The ultimate cinematic experience. If you like good movies this is a must see! If you haven't seen it yet the next time you are free for 3 hours this is what you should be watching.,positive
"The life of a mob leader through Francis Fords eyes, The Godfather The Godfather is an American crime/gangster film by director Francis Frod Cuppola. It is based on the Mario Puzo's mafia novel. The main roles in the film are Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando and his son Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. The film tells us the story of an Italian Mafia family from New York. The Godfather is in theaters since March 24, 1972 and it lasts 175 minutes. It's a beautiful film and I was very impressed. I was very curious and the film was better than my expectations. The cast was well prepared and the actors had performed well. The Godfather is about an Italian mafia family from New York. The head of this mafia is Don Corleone. He was mainly concerned with Casino and has influence with politicians as well as the police, this power makes people respect him. The film starts with her daughter's wedding party. The film only starts to become more interesting after Michael Corleone's return as a hero and build his own criminal life. The tension was from the beginning to the end of the film in a rising line. The story built a climax and reached his highest point at the moment when Michael, the youngest son of Don Corleone, took the ropes on his hand and became the new leader of the mafia family. Afterwards, the actions decreased in a descending line until the end of the film. Vito Corleone is the moral of the film. He is old and tired to continue with his criminal case. He knows that playing cards is not a problem for society, but drugs are a dirty job. I think the godfather is more than just a Mafia movie. The story is based on life events and gives us a picture of how far people go even to the border of life and death to have power and respect. It is certainly worth watching the film and afterwards you will be curious about the other versions.",positive
"Review of ""The Godfather"" The Godfather, arguably the single most popular movie about mafia's ever, was directed by Francis Ford Coppola on the 27th of October 1972. The movie is based on the 1969 novel which shares the same name. With actors such as Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and James Caan, who all played iconic roles and portrayed the characters beautifully, the movie has rightfully gained its acclaim.The film was also a genuine God in the film world, as he won a lot of awards and literally made this film history. The first movie of the famous trilogy revolves around Don Corleone and his gang, or as they say in true mafia style: family. You'd think a notorious gambling addict wouldn't be all too scary, but that's before you take into account both his power in politics and the police said ""power is why people both fear, and respect him."" But someone clearly didn't care about that. Solozzo is a Turk who wanted to earn a lot of money, so he contacted Corleone with the intention of striking up a deal. But much to Solozzo's surprise, Don wasn't exactly a big fan of dipping his feet into the drug dealing area. The police didn't mind him gambling since all in all, it isn't harmful to others. Drug dealing on the other hand isn't exactly as harmless. Solozzo clearly didn't like that answer and decided to deal with this issue in true mafia style: by shooting Corleone with a gun. Yet somehow, in true miraculous fashion, Don managed to survive. But Old Don wasn't willing to stay as the head of the family, his time had passed and it was time to pass on the torch. This position was going to go to his youngest son, Michael. But things didn't exactly go as planned. We get to see a war like never seen before to decide who can inherit the throne, or well in this case, the position of Godfather. What makes The Godfather so different from any other mafia movie is the fact that it is viewed from the inside, from within the family. The movie is told from the family's point of view and you don't really get to see what happens outside of the family because frankly, it's irrelevant. And if one pays close attention you might notice something: Don Corleone is a professional criminal, yet we don't see him commit any crimes. There isn't anybody whose family is held hostage or who's being blackmailed into giving them all their wealth. It's a story about a family, though quite a violent one, trying to live their life to the fullest. This adds onto the charm of the movie even more. So, I'd obviously heard of the highly acclaimed Godfather, but hadn't come around to watching it myself just yet. It was amazing, from the way you get to see how a mafia family interacts to the perfect acting of Marlon Brando. The voice, the looks, the vibe, everything just matched perfectly. And it's not as if the plot was bland, it had more than its fair share of twists on unexpected occurrences. It's an exciting experience, and one I'd recommend to all of you too. To keep it short, the movie is a great representation of the mafia as well as a beautiful mash up of acting, plot and music. I personally couldn't even find one single flaw in this movie, but maybe that's because I was so fascinated throughout the whole experience. I do have one remark though: the women pretty much don't play a role in this movie at all. They're used and then discarded, and it's as simple as that. Michael never tells Kay about Apollonia, and the daughter of Don is pretty much irrelevant to the story. Also, Vito's wife is pretty much just known as that one woman who poses with him. Though personally I don't mind too much, I can understand why people would possibly get offended by this. I give this movie a 9/10. It is, no doubt, one of the best movies I've ever seen.

"The father of all Review The Godfather is an American crime movie based on Mario Puzo's novel ""The Godfather"". The movie follows an Italian mafia family and their internal family and business problems. The first scene was immediately an eye-catcher with the first shot inside a dark, shuttered room. A man came to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist at the Sicilian wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone better known as the Godfather himself. Don Corleone's response must be one of the most iconic moments in movie history. At that moment I knew that I was going to watch a true mafia movie. The story gives the inside perspective of the mafia. That is its secrets, its power struggle and its charms. And I think that it has shaped the public perception of the mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather.The only villains in the story are traitors. There is one commandment that I will never forget spoken by Michael, a son of Don Corleone played by Al Pacino: ""Don't ever take sides against the family"". As the day continues on the wedding, there are two more scenes in the Godfather's darkened study, intercut with scenes from the wedding outside. By the end of the wedding , most of the main characters will have been introduced and we will know essential things about their personalities. It was a creative way of filmmaking. The director brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn into the Godfather's world. One thing that was remarkable was that even after all the shooting and explosions, not a single innocent victim was killed in the movie. The irony of the title is that it eventually comes to refer to the son, not the father. As the film starts Michael is not part of the family business and plans to marry a women who is not Italian. His turning point comes when he saves his father's life by moving his hospital bed, and whispers: ""I'm with you now."" For a movie made in the early 70's the quality was really outstanding for me with great shots and scenes. Unlike the fighting scenes, I was very disapointed. The timing and angle of the fist could be done much better. But overall, I can understand why this movie is seen as one of the greatest movies of all time. The acting is of the highest level, the story is original and the soundtrack is legendary. The Godfather is the father of all mafia/gangster movies ever produced. 9,5/10 Stefaan Henrard",positive
Best movie ever made. Flawless.,positive

The best film yet made (along with part II).,positive
"The Godfather is the best mob film ever made. Marlon Brando was born to play Vito Corleone. And let's not forget the amazing performances from Al Pacino, James Cann, and Robert Duvall. As for Francis Ford Coppola, he took every task of making this film into a reality.",positive
YEP! its a MAAAAAsterpiece. the acting in this flick is gorges! the story is an moonlander. literally. 10/10,positive
A pinnacle achievement in cinema. 'The Godfather' simply satisfies all expectations and deserves its praise.

"AFI 100 Greatest Films - #3 This one never gets old for me, and I may even gain more respect with each watch. The acting, cinematography, script and plot all blend perfectly, making three hours melt away completely. The number of lines from this film still used in popular culture always astounds me and I have to guess this was my first experience watching an antihero play such a large role, a device which has become all too common today. I normally don't think it is fair to rate movies without a disclaimer when I have previously read the source material they derive from, but this is one of the rare cases it would make no difference.",positive
Imagine sitting down to watch what is widely considered a classic then feeling like you just wasted over three hours of your life. That's how I felt during this. I hate the godfather 3 I wish it was the first one,negative
Top 20 of all time movies in my opinion. Must see!,positive
Coppola can get the performances required but otherwise the movie just isn't as good as the book and comes across as another dreary mafia movie.,negative
Absoluta obra maestra!!!!,positive
"Fantastic performances and intriguing plot, however suffers slightly with pace.",positive
"The Godfather deserves the reputation it has as one of the greatest films in American cinema. Every performance is perfect, between Brando, Pacino, Caan and Duvall it's hard to say who did the best. Something must have happened to Coppola in the late 60s and early 70s that gave him some ability to make 4 perfect films from 1972-'79 that was never recaptured.We as a society are obsessed with crime dramas and this is arguably the best of them all.",positive

Its very rare you see a movie that lives up to this type of hype. It has almost no faults in its writing. It has some exceptional performances by multiple actors. The scene are well shot. the writing is almost perfect. It's 3 hours long but very much justified by the end.,positive
"Being one of Hollywood's most thriving classics, ""The Godfather"" is such a classic movie that it has gained a protective bubble of good critics around it. And for a good reason. It speaks of corruption (being set, of course, in the Sicilian Mafia) and also of family issues, exceedingly acomplishing every goal it sets. It's of course also a classic of American Cinema, so it's DEFINITELY worth the watch.",positive
simply the greatest of all time,positive
"Rating: 81/100, 81% B+ Many, and I mean many, people consider “The Godfather” the greatest movie of all time. I do see how it is up for contention, but it’s not my pick. The Godfather could easily be a 5/5 movie, but you would have to settle with being confused and not being able to follow the storyline completely. There will be moments where you are completely in the dark about the conversation that is happening or what the characters are doing. Some will say “it’s so complex, you’ll only get it if you’re smart” or “it’s so complex it’s suppose to be that way”.",positive
I cant talk about this movie,positive
Probably the best film ever made.,positive
Greatest of all time 👑,positive
Overrated and not as good as Part II.,negative
"Nowadays we are almost away from that criminal things, but it is exciting to get acquainted with this sphere, to know how those influential people act in those times. In this film, it is highlighted that sometimes these people even could risk their lives to keep their high place in society or to run their businesses. And this incredible cast of Godfather was able to show the characters of the people of that time. Therefore I cannot criticize this film because it is a masterpiece.",positive
A masterpiece. This movie can't be touched..,positive

"Saw this as a young teen but didn't really remember much of it. Just saw it again (in 2019). This must've been seen as a great film in the 70s but seeing it now was hugely disappointing. I was not impressed with the acting or any of the character development. The men were more like caricatures and the women were treated as mindless objects. Michael's character makes a complete 180 but Pacino doesn't display that in a believable way. Why does he show up late to his sister's wedding reception, and in uniform when the rest of the family men are in tuxedos? Are we to believe Michael leaves Kay for 4 years, no one else dates her, and she accepts his proposal immediately upon his return? In this movie about a powerful family, has she absolutely no family? How does the newspaper immediately write a lengthy article about Vito's attempted murder before anyone in the family even reaches Michael? How could any hospital be as deserted as the one depicted? What takes so long for Connie to accuse Michael of being behind Carlo's murder? Why does Tom never marry? (If he did why is his character presented as so 1 dimensional?) Too many unrealistic elements to be a great movie.",negative

"The Godfather was released in 1972, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. It tells the story of a family of mobsters called the Corleones and the rise to power of Michael Corleone. The Godfather is one of the best pieces of cinema I have ever seen. It succeeds in almost every single aspect and then some. The acting all around is pretty perfect. Marlon Brando gives a layered performance as the powerful but old fashioned crime boss, Vito Corleone. His character goes through so much in this movie and he tries his best to keep the family and organization together even as his time is coming to an end. Brando consistently gives nuance and compassion to Vito. Vito dies knowing that his family and business will live on and his death is a peaceful one reflecting the honorable and passionate way he handled the business but also melancholy as his organization will never be the same after him. Al Pacino does a terrific job as Michael and he conveys the rapid but always natural decline into crime magnificently. Michael doesn't understand the important family aspects as well as Vito does and over the course of the movie, everything Vito stood for as the head of the Corleone family is torn down. Michael isn't honorable, he's ruthless, deceitful, he doesn't care about his family as much as Vito, he goes against Vito's wishes, and he is willing to do anything for the business. Vito understood that the crime and family aspects went hand in hand which Michael never did. That dynamic and development helps make Michael one of the most compelling protagonists in movie history. James Caan does a really good job as the short tempered and brash Sonny. His end is inevitable right from his first scene because he is a flawed person who is much too emotional for the business his family works in. Tom, played by Robert Duvall, is the adopted brother of the family and is always the right hand man. If there is bad news he is the one to tell you about it. His role in the business is to carry out the wishes of the Don. He is calm, thoughtful, and loyal. The perfect counter to Sonny. Tom is always doing what someone needs him to do because he always feels in debt to the Corleones making him one of the most understandable and likeable characters in the film. I could go on listing off characters because everyone is pretty much perfect in this movie. But the most important thing is that Vito is the perfect Don. He's compassionate when he needs to be, cold when he needs to be, caring when he needs to be, and he is ruthless when he needs to be. Michael is smart, ruthless, and calculating but when it comes to being compassionate to his enemies and comrades he fails. Sonny is loyal and devoted to the family but his temper and overall hot headed nature means he can't think things through or make a plan without his personal feelings getting in the way. Tom isn't afraid to get his hands dirty and is extremely loyal to the family but he is a man who carries out the plans and not the one who makes them. The comparing and contrasting with Vito and his children is the most interesting aspect of the movie to me. When Vito is in control everything is perfect but when any of his kids are in control there will always be something wrong. That sense of sorrow you get when you realize that Michael never will be the perfect Don and the kind of gangsters like Vito die with him is so sad but so interesting to watch unfold. The characters and their dynamics between each other are absolutely perfect and one of the best if not the best factors of the movie. Secondly, the story is also really interesting. It's a simple premise of gangsters in New York but comes packaged with so many layers and interesting plot details it raises the whole thing up 100 notches. The story is so dense and rich with intriguing ideas and themes. Everything has a purpose and every aspect is fleshed out to its fullest extent. The story feels really tight and wound together with not threads or strands being left in the air after it ends. Everything is so intricate and well put together. The movie has so many great and quotable lines that are really a testament to how well this movie holds up. There is barely anything that seems goofy or outdated other than a few individual moments and details. The action is quick and brief but very well done and very well shot. Every death isn't poetic and flashy. They're more like brutal executions. There is always a sense of impending doom with each of the kills. The audience knows what's going to happen always a bit before the characters do so you get to feel a real sense of dread when someone is about to die or get shot. Whether it's the way it affects the characters or the audience the action and kills are always delivered perfectly. There is a better sense of it in the sequel but the montage of Michael brutally and swiftly taking out his enemies is so rewarding and engaging because it's been built to over the course of the films nearly three hour runtime. I find it hard to do any complaints about this movie. Occasionally there are moments that pull you out of the movie like Sonny ""punching"" Carl and very clearly missing or when someone is shot in the face but then slowly lower their head despite the fact it should be hitting the ground immediately as they die. Or the very slight over acting of Al Pacino's eye movement when deciding whether or not to kill Sollatzo and the Police captain but even then It's to properly convey the inner conflict going through Michael to the audience. Or that the scenes with Michael in Sicily sometimes feel like somewhat of a departure from the tight and well rounded story being told but again this is just giving more reasons to fear Michaels enemies and give him proper reasons for his need for revenge. It's just some really small things that barely matter in the grand scheme of things. In conclusion, The Godfather is an absolute masterclass in storytelling, drama, character development, writing, character writing, cinematography, acting, lighting, and everything in between. It very rarely fails at anything but when it does the issues are so small that you can brush it off immediately and extremely easily. This movie is an absolute masterpiece and if you haven't seen it for some reason I would recommend it to anyone. 10/10",positive
One of the greatest films of all time!,positive
"A classic about family, America, crime, immigration, violence, and so much else.",positive
"Wonderfully satirized, it may feels like you are reading the book with the same heart that Mario Puzo did, ‘The Godfather' is more that a masterpiece also perfectly made by Francis Ford Coppola, it is, with no doubt, the best movie of all times.",positive
"The Godfather is an overrated film. I was disappointed in Marlon Brando's performance, the screenplay, and the pacing. It's three hours of slow, disturbing, mindless, gangster crap. Marlon Brando seems more like a mentally challenged person than a feared top notch Godfather. But out of all the films of 1972 this one is the best of the year.",negative

All time favorite movie,positive
"Maybe because after a few views, The Godfather, like a truly great work of art, is also a certain kind of Rorschach test for those who watch it. So every view is different, and every viewing shows me different things. I do not mean only small pearls that reveal in a second or third view - such as the precise and wonderful characterization of Paulie's secondary character through simple and simple body gestures at the beginning of the film - which I have already exhausted. I mean the way I look at the film and the characters I identify with. In one view I will identify with Vito Corleone, the head of the New York crime family, whose opponents are joining him; In another view, I will feel great closeness to Michael, his young son, who pays a personal price for businesses he did not want; Or maybe it was Sonny Corleone, the eldest brother, the hotheaded and the violent, who would get an unexpected sympathy as a tragic figure. Or perhaps what captures me in this film is actually his class as a ""classic""? Perhaps the knowledge that I am watching a movie that has been quoted so many times and has so profoundly influenced the world of cultural contexts in which we live - from the Sopranos to images of government corruption in Israel - fascinates me. So I can suddenly get a nice insight into another film, or about the reason why they did not take me to the last job I interviewed. I guess the trivia information I mentioned at the top of the page suggests I'm not the only one who feels that way about the film. So it seems that the status of the 'godfather' indicates that the film is hurting the emotions of other viewers. I hope that even a viewer who does not feel anything will suddenly recognize the lines of a dialogue he has heard thousands of times in the past (""We will offer him an offer he can not refuse,"" ""sleep with the fish"") or figures he has seen in dozens of films since then. In any case, watching the Godfather is a must - even if you do not find a film that is so well detailed on your chords, at least complement a cultural classic.",positive
"This is widely considered one of the greatest films of all time and although I wouldn't personally rank it up there it is an exceptionally well made and entertaining film that is a defining example of it's genre. My familiarity with Francis Ford Coppola came from Apocalypse Now (1979), one of my personal favorite musicals One from the Heart (1982) and the New York Stories (1989) segment ""Life Without Zoe"" but with this being considered his best film and his other work being nothing short of incredible my standards were high. This film is also considered one of the greatest Best Picture winners of all time which puts it in the company of Gone with the Wind (1939) and It Happened One Night (1934). I'm glad I have watched this film not just because of it's cultural significance but because it really is a great movie that is worth investing nearly three hours in. Michael Corleone, Al Pacino, has recently returned from World War II and is in a loving relationship with Kay, Diane Keaton, but the dramas of his family's lifestyle threaten to drag him into being the head of a crime family instead of living the stable life he had been planning for. His father Don Vito Corelone, Marlon Brando, is losing his grip on New York as the other major crime syndicates gain control and aim to pick off the major members of the Corleone family one by one. After Vito is shot by a drug baron and almost dies Michael defends him and shoots two dirty police officers which pulls him into the crime world and causes him to seek cover in Italy. Many other plot developments occur but in the end Michael takes over as Godfather and takes down all of his enemies including his brother in law while distancing himself from his wife Kay. This genre of film usually doesn't work for me but this film really engrossed me to the point that the three hours slipped by as though no time at all had passed. One of the major reasons for this was how well the characters were drawn as we get so many interesting relationship dynamics explored and so many characters with rich backstories. Everyone from Tom Hagen, Robert Duvall, to Sonny Corleone, James Caan, got a moment to express some deeper, repressed emotion that hints at something from their past and that was what kept me wondering. Obviously the most fascinating relationship is that between Michael and Vito as we see that the son who had been unwilling to commit to the lifestyle that Vito is a slave to still be his father's favorite even as his other sons are more dedicated. There was so much that Coppola was able to convey in such a short amount of time and in between all of the violence and the releases of tension we are transfixed simply by looks and tense exchanges of dialogue. The performances are another part of what makes the film so great as some of the greatest actors of all time appear on screen together in this film. Pacino is brilliant as the ambivalent Michael with his moody intensity turned towards representing one of the most famous character arcs in cinema history. Brando is iconic as the Godfather as just his presence is enough to sell us on the idea that he is a fading but highly respected and feared figure in the world of crime. His soft, reedy voice and many unusual decisions he makes in his portrayal of the character only add to the shadow he casts as few actors would have been so bold. In the supporting cast we get Duvall, Caan, Keaton and Talia Shire who all manage to be mesmerizing even as they only get small amounts of screen time. Coppola really lets them shine even if only for a few minutes and it's no surprise that these actors would go on to be fantastic in other films as well. This was the undisputed winner at the 1973 Academy Awards and it's reputation has only improved over time as most agree that it's one of the most deserving Best Picture winners in history yet it still didn't earn Coppola a Best Director win.",positive
"I wish I could ‘get’ this film like most everyone, but I can’t. From the moment it starts I want nothing but to get away from these horrible people. I can identify with almost no one. Why are all the women so (almost) entirely blind or uncaring about the violence and crimes of their men? I find Brando either brilliant or hammy. I will rate it generally high because I understand it to be one if those great films that is just not my thing at all.",negative
A MASTERPIECE a movie that changed the film industry for the best a MUST see for ALL ages 11/10,positive
Timeless perfection.,positive
"Spectacular, Brando performance must be taught to generations.",positive
This is one of the greatest movies of all time. I loved every single second of this movie. The only part where I thought please move on is the wedding. And even then I would want to stay at that wedding if I knew what was going to come next. Every character in this movie was like watching someone in real life. The Acting was so good I almost forgot I was watching a Movie. Michael Corleone was my favorite character in this movie. The actor did an amazing job with his character. The Story about the Corleone family had me at the end of my seat most of the movie. I didn't know who was going to die or live. These mafia members will do anything to get what they want and to have money. The movie is almost 3 hours long and it felt like only 1 hour when I sat down and watched this movie. I loved every single part. I can't wait to watch part 2. I believe the acting in this movie might just be the best of the best!!!,positive
"I don't understand why this film isn't 100% on here. This is literally the greatest film ever made. If you don't like this film, then you don't have a good taste for cinema and should GTFO",positive
It's The Godfather.. Enough said.,positive
"Absolute masterful film making. The acting performances of Brando and Al Pacino complement each other in such a way that is effortless. The master and student dynamic as well as the father/son dynamic development is pure perfection. Casablanca, Citizen Kane, and Maltese Falcon rival this masterpiece of a movie. Absolutely loved this movie.",positive
This is a masterpiece,positive
"I had this on my watch list because The Godfather is supposed to be one of the best movies of all time. Well, one thing is for sure, it's a long movie, and because of that I didn't watch it in one sitting. This film is about the mafia in the 1940s so it has a lot of Italians in it, which eventually got confusing because all the names started to sound the same and couldn't tell who was who. There were, however, some good twists and surprises in it. Those twists were so big that I was actually shocked. To me, this isn't the best movie ever, but it is worth a watch.",positive
"A masterpiece beginning to end with what seems to be one of the greatest films ever, following a mafia family and their constant life threatening issues. Marlon Brando pulled off one of the best characters in film history, a satisfying classic that is a must see.",positive
I do not know or describe the excellent work of Coppola and Marlon Brando in the direction / script and performance respectively and also credits for Mario Puzo for the work `` The Godfather'' Note: Don Vitto Corleone without hesitation is one of the best characters that has appeared on the big screen.,positive
A beautifully filmed movie with a script and a cast to match. Truly one of the greatest movies ever.,positive
"Classic excellent, brilliant",positive
This is probably one of the best movies ever made.,positive
I can’t remember the last time you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee....instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to me married and you ask me for murder.,positive
This become one of my favorite films since first viewing.,positive
Probbably one of the top 3 best movies ever made,positive
Meaningful masterpiece!!!,positive
"One of the most overrated movies of all time, this flick is slow, campy and condescending to the audience. Like its star, Marlan Brando, it tries to hard to be cool and lives off of its unearned mystique. It was created, like many movies in the 70's and 80's, to stroke the egos of Italian-Americans, especially those who romantacize the mafia. The movie takes itself too seriously and, like Satan, it's power is overrated. This film belongs, comfortably, in the dustbin of history.",negative
A very good mob movie one of the best noting beats it,positive
my 3rd favorite movie ever after part 2 and heat respectfully,positive
One of the best films of all time,positive
This Movie is the GOAT its a shame the users on this site don't even have this in the top,positive
One of the most fantastic movies of the modern age. An important piece of American history that should be experienced by all.,positive

"One of my all time favorites , A movie I can watch over and over . A true masterpiece .",positive
The greatest movie ever made.,positive
The godfather is a film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Really good acting. Really good characters especially the Carleone family. Really good story. Really good cinematography with some great shots especially for the time. Really good setting with America to Italy in the 1940s. Very good set design and props. Great costume design with great detail. Really good style with the colour scheme to the way it's filmed. Very good action with really good directing. Really good dialogue from how it's delivered to how it was written. Good and steady editing. Really good music in my opinion one of the best soundtracks to be put to film. Good comedy between the brothers. Very good atmosphere from start to finish. Very good tension throughout the film. The emotion is also portrayed really well between the characters. Over all the film has really iconic scenes and is really enjoyable. Over all I give it a 10/10 - so close,positive
"A film you can't refuse. Trimming the fat of the book, and with fantastic direction and acting, The Godfather is rightfully regarded as a landmark American film.",positive
Um dos melhores filmes de todos os tempos,positive
"One of the most enjoyable movies ever, with deep an interesting charachters and realistic storylines. Quite toned down, no over the top action, but the gradual transformation of Michael into a mafia boss, despite his intent not to become one. An important scence in the beginning, from the wedding, has come to symbolize the type of relationship-based culture for me. Bonasera has been avioding the mob for a long time, but now that his daugther was assaulted, he needs their help. He comes and asks for help, offering money. The Godfather refuses - he does not want money, we wants respect. Debt precedes money as a social institution, according to Graeber. The original way of functioning in an economy was local and very trust-based. These types of institutions, together with a well-developed honor codex are very prevalent in the mafia culture. The gracious, private, inconspicuous nature of the mafia, and their honor of their word are central to their role in society. The story touches on the American dream. âI believe in America. America has made my fortune.â? Bonasera tells Don Vito who knows well enough that Bonasera earned his financial success through legal means, being a man of integrity and with faith in the American judicial system. Like âa good Americanâ? who has assimilated in the American way of life, Bonasera raised his âdaughter in the American fashionâ¦ [and] gave her freedomâ¦â? onasera uses the American Dream and tries to live in it, relish in it, and bask in the glory of it. Once he encounters a pivotal moment in his life that threatens his ideals and his family and could not find clarity in the dark side of the Dream, he runs down to Don Vitoâ(TM)s underworld.",positive
"One of the greatest movies ever made. Compelling writing, characters and performances - pure cinematic gold. Exquisite direction, casting perfection - just a stunning movie that can be watched again and again and reveals new nuances, etc. The hauntingly beautiful score is also an essential part of the atmosphere of the film.",positive
Best movie ever made. PEROID!!!!,positive
"If this movie seems slow to you, you've probably been watching too much contemporary television. This is how movies ought to be paced - organically, and earning their progress. The cast is amazing. The score is famous for a reason. Its scenes became cliche for a reason. It won't make you feel better about the world, but damn is this a great example of storytelling. Watched it several times using boxxy software app, a masterpiece!",positive
This movie is great!,positive
"I don't know how I had not watched this film until just a week ago, but I'm glad because this is not a movie to watch with distractions or when you are too young because you will not enjoy it as much as an adult does. I saw this movie and immediately become an addict, watched it at least 3 more times the same week. There is so much to talk about it! I found it hard to think someone doesn't enjoying this one. The cast, the great dialogue, big plot twists, all the emotions, everything makes it just great. This is no a film as many of these times that need a 4K quality to be appealing, you will not waste your time, every minute of the almost 3 hours is worth. You will want even more. If you haven't watch it, what are you waiting for? (""This is an offer you can't refuse"")",positive
This movie is a treasure. Its influences on culture and cinema have been enduring and unmistakable. A classic in every way.,positive
One of the best movies ever,positive
"The best movie of all time .. History already indicates it that way, its performances, its history, its photography, everything is perfect, what I can say is simple rhetoric.",positive
"This elegiac organised-crime saga from the young Francis Ford Coppola is one of the all-time high-water marks of American cinema, rich with subtle acting and blessed with stunning cinematography from Gordon Willis. It proves that an intelligent, sometimes slow-moving drama with impeccable artistic credentials can create queues around the block. Taken with its 1974 sequel, it manages to define the age in which it was made, while remaining a period piece. Beginning after the Second World War, it traces the handover of power within the Corleone family, from the old world values of Don Vito (a heavily disguised but stately Marlon Brando) to his son, the ""white sheep"" Michael (Al Pacino, proving that his risky casting was inspired). The Mafia is never mentioned by name, but underneath all the slayings and sinister ""offers you can't refuse"", this is an immigrant family drama about assimilation, blood loyalty and honour.",positive
The greatest movie of all-time. Perfect. 10/10.,positive
"Godfather sets a new golden standard in American cinema thanks to superb storytelling and bigger-than-life characters, creating a near mythological tale about family, power and corruption.",positive
Dank as fuck also it's on netflix,positive
Very emotional and very entertaining. One of the best films in history. One instant classic when it was released on 1972!!,positive
"The Wedding at the beginning of the film represents youth, femininity, joy, love. Vito Corleone is a persuasive businessman and has a very calm demeanor. The scene with the Horseâ(TM)s head shows us that the Corleoneâ(TM)s are willing to go to great lengths to accomplish their mission. Vito Corleone is a dangerous man and because of that, dangerous men are after hi When Michael Corleone starts to take over the family business, every thing is very new to him, he gets into a few gunfights with the competition. When Vito Corleone gets sick, people from other mafiaâ(TM)s try to kill him. This movie has many violent scenes and one scene with nudity. I enjoyed the scene when Michael Corleone got married. It was sad when Vito Corleone passed away, at least he got to spend time with one of his grandsons before he died. When Michael Corleone and his wife have a new son, this represents rebirth, the circle of life. Michael Corleoneâ(TM)s wife was very concerned about his work in the mafia, however this was now his duty, so he told his wife not to mind his business.",positive
This is pretty good. U seen this shit?,positive
Es una pelÃ­cula genial en todo aspecto,positive
"People ask me what do you like more? Part I or II? And I have to say II but these are equally tied. The story is original and shocking. I like that they have to balls to kill of more than half the characters, IN THE FIRST MOVIE. I only like part II more because I think it has a better opening act.",positive
This film was great.,positive
My all-time favourite movie.,positive
In my top five for my favorite movies of all time. How could it not be?,positive
An intense look into a hard family,positive
"I like to say that if you thought Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were cool, they're mere sidekicks to Marlon Brando here. This film can feel slow and long but every scene is necessary and worthwhile. It has everything and is near perfection.",positive
I have finally watched this film. Blimey it is long! I think I will wait a couple of months before I watch The Godfather II which is even longer....,positive
It really is the greatest,positive
Part 3 is 98%???!! Lmao,negative
"The Godfather is often quoted as one of the best American movies ever made. I have to agree with this opinion, although, it is not my favourite movie there is no denying the perfect direction of this film by Coppola and the fantastic performances from everyone involved, especially Marlon Brando. The Godfather is simply an amazing classic which for me gets better with every viewing. It gives us an accurate Mafia movie which also has an amazing plot which follows the downfall of Michael Corleone due to his willingness to support his family in times of need. Michael's character arc is perhaps one of the best in all of cinema and is perfectly executed. Overall, The Godfather is by far one of the best movies of all time and revolutionised moviemaking as a whole. A must-watch classic for anyone who admires good film.",positive
"Arguably the best motion picture ever made along with Godfather Part II. Brilliantly acted, sensational scripts, holds up with time.",positive
Will add review soon...,positive
"Francis Ford Coppola's quintessential crime drama that went on to inspire many other films down the line while still standing as an exquisite cinematic milestone. However, I found the plot to be a bore, and I lacked interest in the whole gang, mob, mafia, crime genre as a whole, to begin with.",negative
Continously delaying the production of The Mappercast Movie,negative
"Just about as great as a movie's ever going to be. As for the storytelling, The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that simultaneously kicks ass.",positive
"Best movie ever, a true masterpiece",positive
"A different perspective each time I watch as I get older. Phenomenal filmmaking, especially for its time.",positive
BEST movie of all time,positive
"In my own opinion, this is one of the best films ever created. Yes, there are some parts that are different from the book, but the film still captures the spirit from the book. You have a great cast who I think you couldn't find anyone better to play the characters. Marlon Brando gave a great performance, Al Pacino played Michael spot on, James Caan and Robert Duval just were great. To me, this is one of my favorite films.",positive
"This movie is a insane, curious, classic.",positive
Best movie of all time from my POV.,positive
"Amazing on every level, The Godfather is beautiful as a drama full of family and action",positive
if you love cinema you must see this beautiful movie Great performance from the director my tips to you you should foucs in movie from first time to foucs in scene to geat all the beautiful of this movie is from my greats movie i have ever scene,positive
"How good are the characters that after all these years later we can talk about Michael, Sonny, Tom, Fredo, Don, Luca and Clemenza like they are life long friends. My only complaint to this movie, and it actually works as a pro to the characterization that Coppola’s accomplishes, is I wish we had more of The Corleone family at their peak. The chemistry between the now LEGENDARY group of actors and their interactions among each other as a family feel so authentic and well rounded that I could listen to their discussions for an entire mini series. It is only 40 minutes after all before we see the seams start to break in the family. With all that said this is still probably the greatest film ever put to screen and has endless rewatch potential.",positive
The absolute best movie of all time,positive
Classic. There is a reason they haven’t tried to remake this,positive
"If pressed, I'd probably back this and the best film ever made, or at least the best film made inside the American studio system. It's a great adaptation of a popular novel that improves on the novel (as movies are apt to do ... it seems very difficult to adapt great novels to the screen, but merely good ones usually make cracking good films). It's perfectly cast, which is quite a feat given it's mix of relatively obscure Hollywood actors and complete unknowns. The Nino Rota sore is perfection. I could quibble about a few things (I'm not that keen on Talia Shire), but it's a 3 hour film that I could watch again immediately after finishing it.",positive
Three hours of that will keep you captivated more than the 90 min action films today.,positive
"A truly legendary movie,a masterpiece. The performances in this are out of this world... This is isnt a movie..its like watching a real life mafia family.",positive
Everything Works Very Well.,positive
"I completely understand why The Godfather is widely viewed as one of the best films ever made. Great plot, good well-developed characters, never getting boring at all, interesting and full of thrills. The Godfather deserves its status as one of the best films ever made. An essential film for any film fan.",positive
Most overrated film in history.,negative
"Truth be told, The Godfather doesn't need a review. Without undue emphasis, Francis Ford Coppola's direction, Brando's and Pacino's performances are literally flawless. The first time I watched ""The Godfather"", I was a child and it was the most astonishing film I'd ever seen. Due to my introversion, I was spending too much leisure time in front of TV, and consequently I watched many films during my childhood. However, I can hardly remember those films. But The Godfather isn't one of them. I remember The Godfather as if I watched it yesterday. The Godfather made me experience feelings of admiration. There is almost no film that has 3 hours running time and didn't bore me. But The Godfather was a breathtaking film for me. I admire Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for reducing a thick, best-selling book to a controllable screenplay which anticipated the expectations of the millions who had already read the book. For me, the strength of the Mario Puzo-Francis Ford Coppola script is the unbelievable interaction of all these characters. Seeing 'The Godfather' is still one of the biggest milestones of the film industry 46 years after its release confirms the film's status as an outdated masterpiece. Whenever I see it, it becomes better and impeccable.",positive

"A cinematic masterpiece, in my top 3 all time favorite movies. The Godfather gets everything right about what a film can and should be. The true genius of director Francis Ford Coppola is demonstrated in this iconic piece of cinema. From Marlon Brando's oscar winning performance to the amazing Al Pacino, to the faith fullness of the book by Mario Puzo. It is everything I would want from a movie and more. This movie definitely will make you an offer you can't refuse, 10/10",positive
This maybe the best movie of all time and the second Godfather is right behind it!!!!,positive
possibly the greatest movie ever made.,positive
Simply a MASterPiece !,positive
It wasn't a bad movie but is very over rated.,negative
THE WORST MOVIE IN HISTORY.,negative
"The greatest gangster movie ever made! Director Francis Ford Coppola created his film masterpiece with The Godfather. The direction is immaculate. The editing is so clever and reveals many character traits just on a visual level. Mario Puzo's script is as brilliant a crime story as has ever been told. Every line is quotable and memorable. There is a reason The Godfather is a staple of pop culture. Musically, The Godfather has perhaps the most beautifully romantic score of any film. Nino Rota is a skilled composer. You can tell he put a great deal of thought into what kind of symphony he would write. There are sweet passages and haunting melodies throughout The Godfather. This is a movie that is greatly enhanced by its lush soundtrack. I think anyone can appreciate its lovely score. Notably, iconic actor Marlon Brando delivers his most beloved latter day performance as Don Vito Corleone the Godfather. Brando's career had already been marked by classic roles and endless influence by the time he took up The Godfather. You get to witness Brando is full form. He is so subtle. Brando never wastes film. He says what needs to be said in as effective delivery as any actor. His introduction of realism to acting is demonstrated herein. You see Brando's commanding presence with every movement and breathe. He is really that good. Brando is compelling every second he is on screen. You are drawn to his charisma and composure. The Godfather is a masterclass in complex acting and verisimilitude. Additionally, the supporting cast is so well fitted for The Godfather. Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Abe Vigoda, and Talia Shire are all perfect in their respective roles. You get the Italian mob's outrageous violence, heinous treachery, familial devotion, criminal organization, and moral undoing. The Godfather is the highly entertaining start to this crime saga. You have to watch this movie, not because it is great by any sane person's standards, but because The Godfather is so much fun. Watch the audacity of the Corleone crime family commit endless felonies with shocking indignation.",positive
"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But when I finished watching the film, the only thing I found enjoyable was the opening scene. The rest of the movie was completely filled with boring scenes to pad the runtime, as well as dialogue that's not clever or even plot-servicing. Not to mention that there are far too many plotlines intertwining with one another, that it can get dizzying. Honestly, the movie would've been better as a TV show.",negative

"Everyone should see this classic. It's done so origanally that it surpirised me the first timeI watched it. No other movie before has done something like this.

"I do not understand the hype and legacy this movie enjoys. This is an average film at best, and if i had to choose a better mob movie then i would go with Goodfellas every time. The film follows two story lines. There's Marlon Brando as ""Don Corleone"" and his dealings with the organized crime business. And then there is Al Pacino as ""Michael Corleone"" and his decent into the business, and how it corrupts and transforms him into a monster. You would think that by this description the movie must be tense, and interesting right? Well your wrong. The movie is boring, drawn out, and lacks any tension, or excitement. Not only that but i don't know if i was so bored that i just missed half the dialogue, or if it was never there to begin with. I was perpetually confused by the stuff happening in this movie because I wasn't getting any info as to what the characters were doing, or what was being set up. If you really like mobster movies then by all means watch this film and talk about how awesome it is, but beyond that just look for a better movie, because there are a lot of them.",negative
"Finally took the time to give myself a real treat and watch this film again after about 20 years as I remembered it as a supremely good film. I have watched many movies from all over the world during the years and have developed a keen eye for good film making, so wanted to review one of the ""greats"". After having watched it again, I have no choice but to face the fact that this film is indeed very poor film making and I have to admit that I feel embarrassed that I once actually considered this a good film! The biggest gripe I have with this film is the unbelievably poor and unconvincing acting, devoid of any emotional depth whatsoever. Everybody is sterile and no-one is worth caring even the least bit about. Secondly, almost every opportunity for character dynamics and development is missed. The only character that is developed is Michael Corleone's and even that character is changing from one extreme to the other, in an instant, with no transition whatsoever. The result is characters as mere moronic caricatures to the point of absurdity. A staggering waste of talent. To top it off, the storyline is thin and highly predictable, simply an unforgivable waste of potential. The organised crime genre of films have always fascinated me and continue to do so. With so many truly great films in this genre, don't waste your time on this one. The Godfather is one of the worst.",negative

"In my mind the greatest film ever made. Incredible actors, led by an incredible director, playing incredible characters, given and incredible script and putting on incredible performances.",positive
It's only saving grace is that like its title this film is the Godfather for all other modern movies featuring the Italian Mafia that came after it. Other than that it is pretty outdated and features an overrated performance by Al Pacino.,negative
Classic. What more can I say?,positive
"With this being called by many as one of the greatest movies of all time, it's probably a pretty good movie. I found this to be very captivating, and it just goes to show that you don't need the technology they use in filming today to make a GREAT movie. After watching it two times in a row, I still feel like if I went back and watched it again, I would find things that I missed. Now I know why so many rave about this film.",positive
"El padrino de la mano del director Francis Ford Coppola y del escritor original del libro Mario puzo nos narra la vida de don Vito Corleone un mafioso quien junto a su familia y en conjunto con otras familias de Italia y de los estados unidos creo todo un imperio del crímen. Para mí esta es una película ¡perfecta! Tiene todo lo que necesita una película para ser buena y mucha más. Comencemos con la trama; la trama del padrino están completa y compleja que te va a marcar, en cuanto termines de ver esta película te vas a sentir como perteneciente a la familia Corleone y realmente te vas a sentir dentro de la película. Otro punto espectacular de el padrino es su reparto; cada actor hasta el más secundario se esmera, se meten de lleno en su papel y finalmente no sientes una actuación, sientes personas reales que en verdad están viviendo la trama. La escena inicial de la película es una de las escenas más icónicas que uno podrá ver en una película, tenemos a un millonario rogando por ayuda a don Vito Corleone el cual no los presentan en una toma tan épica acariciando su gato y se puede sentir que ese hombre emana poder y tan solo en la primera escena de la película, pero conforme avance la película se nos va mostrando otra cara de don Vito Corleone una más humana como la escenas del hospital donde lo encontramos completamente débil o la escenas donde juega con uno de sus nietos en su jardín. Esto es saber actuar y saber darle vida a un personaje. Recomiendo esta película a todo el mundo y sin duda la colocaría en una lista de películas para ver antes de morir. finalmente le doy a el padrino el honor de la 5 estrellas.",positive

What a fucking masterpiece,positive
"This is not what I was expecting. The Godfather is a legendary film, so perhaps I should have checked my expectations at the door. I feel like I missed something, but I will do my best to unpack it. Everything in this movie is slow-rolled, with the exception of the murder scenes. The problem is not the establishment of a plot point, nor is it the payoff, but the middle. I feel that there were parts of the development cut out, stripping some important context away. Similarly, the characters never feel established, save for Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone. He gets a terrific setup right at the beginning of the film, but I found this detracts from our other characters. Considering Vito's arc, this further detracts from the plot. The acting, however, is very suited to the film. Marlon Brando really steals the show here, as his character is just so much more fleshed out. Al Pacino acts well here, even if his character is not set up well. I loved Robert Duvall and Dinae Keaton as well. I understand it is a classic of American cinema. It just didn't feel complete to me. CUE THE RAGE-TWEETS! (I don't have Twitter, so I will not see the rage-tweets)",negative
clearly one of the best (if not best) movie of all time. Mario Puzo shows us something never shown before. It stays by far as a great example of an original film for future generations.,positive
"No, ""The Godfather"" is not overrated. It is just that good.",positive
"Definitely a slow burn, which may be a turn-off for a lot of people, but a great pay off in the end. The Godfather brings an interesting story to the war on drugs, and the people involved with it",positive
"There's no point in reviewing this movie, of course, just thought I'd express my love for this masterpiece. The Godfather is not overrated. It is truly one of the best movies of all time. Flawless",positive
"Not my cup of tea. It's about the mafia, and I couldn't finish this.",negative
"The greatest movie of all time (in my opinion, of course). This movie includes the greatest performances and a story that I've always loved, the old generation's downfall giving way for the next generation to take its place. I love the small detail like having an orange appear in a scene where someone will die, or having an orange to show that there is a person in that scene that will die later on in the movie. The score is also beautiful (not as beautiful as Star Wars though). For me, this is the greatest film ever made by a lightyear.",positive
Puntaje Original: 9.5 El Padrino es de esas películas que por mas que pasen los años siempre trascenderá generación tras generación. Una película de culto que todo amante del cine debe ver.,positive
"Simply the most American movie ever created. An immigrant family copes with state power, entrenched violence in their community, and the double standards of the legal system post-WWII.",positive
The Godfather is a must watch. I personally believe it is the best movie ever made. This movie does however require a bit of a mature mind because it is the type of movie that can be slow at parts but it pays off because it builds up the story and develops the characters. Important to pay attention and listen when watching. Best move of all time though.,positive
It was the best movie I ever saw,positive

"A true masterpiece of film making, one of the greatest movies ever produced. In a career full of great performances this may be the best one in Marlon Brando's career, it's so understated and so beautiful. While this is my favorite of the Godfather films, Al Pacino might be a little better in part 2 but still gives an outstanding performance in this film. I could keep going on and on gushing over all the amazing actors and their performances but it would just get a little old because it would feel like I say the same thing almost about each one, simply amazing!",positive

"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. While this movie does contain solid performances and good settings, Brando is sometimes difficult to understand. At almost three hours long, there are also a number of long and extended scenes which drag.

"I've never been more hopelessly alone on anything than my opinion on The Godfather. Fantastic performances? Of course, flawless direction and shooting? Of course, important story? Of course, and probably the best assembled cast ever, period. But BORING. Yes I think this is just too boring, and I've seen lawrence of Arabia. U get like 45 mins of dialogue, then an assassination. Just not good enough for me, and it's not mafia films, cuz goodfellas is my favorite movie of all time. Just too much dialogue, eventually there needs to be some kind of sequence that's exciting. Quality movie, just completely overrated.",negative
One of the finest crime pictures to ever be filmed & released!,positive
"Movie night with Iris. Been a few years, but still such an awesome film. Scenes and script has been mimicked and imitated, but they majestically stand the test of time. Love that Iris thought Brando a secondary character, and Pacino is the star. Shes gonna love Part Two.",positive

It has phenomenal direction by Francis Ford Copolla, a very well written script and great NYC cinematography.

"It is largely considered the greatest movie ever made and there is no question that it isn't. It has everything a great movie needs: a perfect cast, innovative techniques and a brilliant narrative.

It also stars James Caan (Sonny), Robert Duvall (Tom), Diane Keaton (Kay), Talia Shire (Connie), Alex Rocco (Moe) and Sterling Hayden (McCluskey). One of the greatest scenes ever featured in the film was Jack Woltz wakes up to find the head of his horse.",positive
This book to film adaptation is faithful and very timeless. Considering how much I enjoy the book. This film shows how to make characters down to earth. I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants sharp story telling and thrilling action scenes.,positive
"A generational passing of the torch, not just in Brando bowing to the microwave-method acting generation of the 1970s, but also in the loss of innocence of American culture. The pervasive message of the film is that of grand failure - certainly not the patriarchal love story some audiences misinterpreted from the movie. The moment when Brando so subtly laments Michael's descent into amoral leadership is made ever more poignant when he realizes that all of his decisions in life came to fruition in this one nostalgic conversation - personally, a father's pointless apology; symbolically, an epic betrayal of American values. Maybe the first film was too subtle for its own good, which explains the more literal minded Godfather II and III. It's unthinkable to create a list without including a ""classic"" screen villain, but I seriously doubt anyone can tell me that there is a protagonist more deviant, more irredeemable and more subtle, than Michael Corleone, played with robotic intensity and ferocious cunning by a young Al Pacino. Sure, he did more theatrical work in Scarface and Dog Day Afternoon, but The Godfather trilogy was his most ambitious acting challenge, solely because he was an antagonist not merely against the opposing mafia families, nor his delinquent brother Freudo, nor even his long-suffering wife. The true ""hero"" who died at the hands of this heartless antagonist was the boy's own father. Michael Corleone is the antagonist that reflects a wayward son, who buries a respectable family legacy, and who honors his hopeful father in the worst way possible.",positive
As good as I thought it would be,positive
"I think it's a great movie with amazing acting. The movie is suspenseful with many twists and turns. But the downside with it is that it's just a bit to long and it moves really slow, which makes it hard to watch at times.",positive
"The overt symbolism between the timing of Carloâ(TM)s and Connieâ(TM)s baby being baptized and Michael being made the godfather to him being the recently made Don of the family business. Baptism being a deeply held symbol of rebirth or new life, and at the least a significance of change. Throughout the movie there is time passing but while the film portrays this passage well through the highlights and brief moments of characters mentioning or showing time with pregnancy or marriage or wounds being healed such as Michaelâ(TM)s bruise from the Police Caption. When Carlos hit his wife Connie and her pregnant belly holding his first child then the scene switching to the baby crying in the arms of (?) when Connie asked for Sonnyâ(TM)s help before he made his hurried way to seek justice on Carlos but instead met his death. Deeply intellectual this movie moves you to make your own astute observations while inspiriting you to an observing silence and precaution to trust. (3/14/19) #French #Italian",negative
"Phenomenal classic mafia mob movie starring al pacino and Marlon brando as the iconic godfather. This movie is suppository dubbed, the best movie of all time, I don't think so. It's a fantastic movie but greatest of all time, I don't know, maybe it has to sink in my brain for a little while. The cinematography is beautiful, it's really good. Now, onto the acting, the godfather, his voice is unprecedented, it's so unique that only he can do it and nobody else, I want to see someone to impersonate the godfather. The action is cool especially the scene with the assassin getting choked to death by the other family, his eyes popping out is just plain awesome. Can't wait to see the godfather part 2.",positive
Long live The Godfather!,positive
This is what a movie should be.,positive
"The Godfather has been hailed by many to be the greatest movie ever made. After watching it, it's easy to see why. Based off of Mario Puzo's novel, Francis Ford Coppola brings out his all in making this film possible. The story revolves around the rise and fall of a mafia family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Along with a side plot involving young Al Pacino. First of all, that plot was extremely revolutionary and still is. It showed future filmmakers what a gangster flick should be like, and how good a movie can be in general. The screenplay is what brought it together. It was written so well and in a unique way. Each character has his or her own story or personality. They were written in such a way that makes you care for them. The acting had no flaw whatsoever. It started off good careers of Al Pacino and many others. The cinematography was ahead of the time. Back then, it was near breathtaking. Not to mention that it had more than many memorable moments. So many, that it has grown to be one of the most iconic films out there. Almost all through the movie this song plays. An instrumental song that automatically fits in with every scene it's in. What I'm trying to say is that everything works. Over all, The Godfather is a masterpiece of filmmaking, and one that will go down as an example of a fantastic film. 5/5 stars",positive
Best movie I've ever seen it's just spectacular I highly recommend these movies,positive
"This movie is just as excellent and mesmerizing as it was when it was originally released in 1972. A movie that draws you in from its excellent opening scene and never lets go. Al Pacino gives without a doubt the best performance of his career in a role he was born to play. It's unbelievable that he did not win the Academy Award for his performance as he should have. Though he very oddly refused the award, I feel that Marlon Brando deserved it. If I am not mistaken, not too long before his death Brando said he wanted the Oscar. Nice to see he came to his senses. The entire cast is at the top of their game. Francis Ford Coppola is just as excellent behind the camera as the cast is in front of it. See this movie once and you will immediately understand why this movie is considered one of the greatest ever made.",positive
"'The Godfather' is routinely considered one of the greatest films of all time for good reason. Francis Ford Coppola shot 90 hours of footage, whittling it down in the editing room to 3 hours of run-time, turning what the studio expected to be a pulpy gangster flick into a soaring epic. Brando and Pacino and Caan and Duvall and Shire and Cazale and Keaton all get well-deserved credit for lending their talents to the film. But make no mistake--it's Coppola that makes this marionette puppet dance. His screenplay--written alongside Mario Puzo--is masterful. His camerawork throughout the movie is ingenious. And his editing of the film is legendary. Sure, a lot of people consider 'The Godfather: Part II' to be on equal footing, but I'll go to my grave arguing that the original was the purer and more compelling picture between the two.",positive
"The Godfather is ranked in the highest ranks of filmography, and deservedly so. The theme of Italian gangsters set in the mid 1900's seems like such a tired a tired and worn out theme on paper, but Capolla manages to make it seem fresh at every turn. Marlon Brando plays in his career defining role, and completely owns his screen time, which is surprisingly smaller than one would think. Pacino is also magnificent, he captures his characters turn quite well and makes it very believable. I loved the character of Luca Brasi, he will remain one of the best parts of the film in my mind. This classic sacrifices excessive violence and bloodshed in order to build up the world and characters contained in it, and this move is not only smart, but it is what separates this film from the many knock offs of it",positive
"10 out of 10: I don't know what to say. From beginning to end I was hooked. The acting, directing, score, all so amazing. Writing is well done. I could go on but this film is one of the best.",positive
"The Godfather: The Godfather gets everything right. Beautfuly dark, perfectly done and powerfully opressive. The Godfather is the Hollywood movie.",positive
Beautiful film. A classic!!,positive
"I really don't know what to say about this one that you don't already know, it's an integral part of popular culture today. Perfect acting and superb characters, amazing storyline, legendary soundtrack...A true landmark in the history of cinema. Masterpiece",positive
"It's bad and everyone should go fuck themselves in the arsehole with a cactus. All of them, should use one cactus. They have to share it.",negative
"Top of the line entertainment, there is a reason why it's one of the classics.",positive
"The true feel of a movie doesn't need action or dramatic sequences, but acting and love from the characters to see how a movie turns. You can see the dramatic change between positions of Michael (Al Pacino) and Vito (Marlon Brando) and how one cares about the mafia industry and one does not intervene in the movie.",positive
Outstanding. I had never seen a movie like it and probably never will again. It's about as close to the richness of a book in visual form as you will get. The score was outstanding as well.,positive

Just wanna see how low this can get,negative
Could be the best gangster flick of all time.All time classic from start to finish. Sonny's death was one of the best Mob hits to be put on the big screen . Michael's rise to power when at first he didn't even want it was powerful. Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes all time classic line,positive
"Worth the hype! I've been on a gnagster kick these days and it all comes back to this classic. From performance to cinematography to score, nothing else comes close!",positive
A classic movie. 5 easy star.,positive
"In 1972, Francis Ford Coppola crafted one of the greatest gangster movies of all time, with the help of one of the best ensemble casts of all time. Marlon Brando is ridiculously good and iconic as the Godfather and Al Pacino gives a levelled and calculating performance. The supporting cast is great too, Diane Keaton and James Caan in particular I really enjoy watching. However, I don't really like Talia Shire in this film, I think she is over the top and just unrealistic. This is by no means a perfect movie but it comes very close. The opening scenes of the wedding in particular are fascinating and its easy to like the Corleone family because of the class that is shown by them, despite the crimes being committed.",positive
"Holy shit it's insane how intensely this movie starts out. Right off the damn bat! The slow camera pull out to reveal he's talking to Don Corleone, really nice. I love how he's still respectful in paying him money but disrespectful in the way that he does it. That part with the old man singing. What a classic moment in cinema history. I think what's so amazing about this beginning sequence with whole marriage at the house thing, is the way it was filmed. It's almost as if your getting to see everything unfold through a guests point of view. Almost like your looking from the outside in. But then contrast that with the very serious things that are going on inside the house with Don Corleone. Don Corleone seems like an earnest guy. A guy who just wants to help out. Things back then seemed to be able to be dealt with in a more simpler way. You had a problem, you just settled it by talking or by threatening lol. You just needed a big pair on you. It's incredible how they scouted for these locations and nailed it each time. You really feel immersed in the 40's. Either they had a hell of a special effects make up team for that time, or that horses head was real. It's crazy how the story progresses and easily slides you into what the family is about and then starts getting into deeper stuff heavier stuff. Really phenomenal writing. I can see why Marlon Brando is regarded as one of the best actors of all time. It's apparent in this movie. The way he is able to camouflage himself into the character he plays. He has a knack for this, being a chameleon. Holy shit! I was not expecting that death! WTF?! Oh but wait, the tables turn. Can't leave that cannoli behind. God forbid lol. Wow, the whole hospital scene right from the beginning the mood is set. It's creepy ominous almost uneasy and uncomfortable. Crooked cop. Seeing Mike get involved in the families dirty business is pretty damn exciting and seeing the whole plan come together is interesting to watch. I love how Mike's face says it all. You can tell how everything's going to go down just by the smirk on his face. That evil glance he gives to the other family member at the restaurant. Sound and music play such a big role in this movie. And it's almost unnoticeable unless your really paying attention to it. This is brilliant because it blends with everything that's going on. It think what's so attractive about this movie other than the acting and the writing, is that some of these shots are almost like paintings. You can freeze some of these scenes and it's like looking at a still painting. You imagine seeing a girl like that in the Italian countryside? Any man would be interested. This movie is all about the subtitles and the small nuances. Example: when Apollonia and Mike are walking down that trail in the beautiful countryside, you think they are finally alone. But that's not the case. With the camera positioned perfectly, we see her family is walking right behind them and right behind them is Mike's bodyguards. It's almost comical. Amazing to see how close they stick to their culture. That was way too quick of a weeding. I hope there good for each other. I can see why Mike didn't even think about Keaton's character. She's not really looking her best in this movie. Holy shit! When I saw what they did to Sonny, I told myself, ""Oh, they're screwed"". It's nice but also sad to see a vulnerable side of Corleone. What I took from this movie mostly, is that family business is really messy. One family thing to get at the other. Innocent people dying. It's terrible. But damn, is this movie good. It's funny to see how Vegas has changed Fredo. He looks like a pimp. I'm glad the Don was able to go out like that, playing with his grandson. Even at the funeral there doing business! It's ridiculous. Holy shit! The baptism scene with all the other preparation evil stuff that's going on with the ominous organ music in the background! Genius. Damn, who would've thought Mike would be so ruthless. Wow, what a classic movie! Legendary.",positive

"These polls are very very misleading. The majority of users who voted in this poll are probably fans of the movie. If you polled 300 million americans ,35 percent of americans would say they either don't care for the godfather or don't like it or don't have an opinion on it. I think movie critics brainwash people into liking things. I am sorry but no way 98 percent of americans would give it a 3.5 grade or better.

Coppola created an enduring, undisputed masterpiece",positive
One of the best of all time!,positive
"I've learned that I don't usually respond well to gangster movies because I have a difficult time finding characters to care about, and that was my reaction the first time I watched The Godfather. When I watched it again recently, I'm not sure if it was the fact that I knew what to expect or that my film tastes have started to shift, but I kind of loved it. I felt so thoroughly invested in what was happening to the Corleone family, and desperately wanting to see them get ""justice."" I actually sympathized with Vito, Sonny, Michael, and Tom. I could see Michael's slow descent into the family business, and saw both the reason why and the tragedy in it all. The cinematography impressed me, the music was nearly perfect. Even the little things like the high-quality squibs for the gunshots worked for me. I was fully invested in The Godfather, and I don't know why it changed so dramatically for me. Perhaps it's like a fine wine that gets better when you give it time. If I were to express one gripe I had with the film it would be the casting of Al Pacino. I think he's the perfect actor for the second half of the film, as he starts to show his darker side, but I felt the first half would work better if he would have displayed some innocence and meekness. To me, while the script has him clearly being a different person as the film progresses, I felt his performance was similar throughout. It didn't hurt the story, and clearly it didn't bother me too much since I loved the film so much more this time. I think I finally get why The Godfather is a classic.",positive
The best movie of all time.,positive
"With the starring roles of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, this Mafia classic is loved by many.",positive

"A strong performance by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The Godfather made you sympathize with criminals like no other movie could, and shows how the mafia really was. Overall The Godfather had great performances, plot, subplots, and was a revolutionary movie.",positive
Absolutely incredible. Timless masterpiece. Just watched in Blu ray for the first time and to see this remastered into HD was very special. Never has a set of films gripped me so much. I still remember watching this for the first time I had never been pulled into a film that much for the whole 3 hours I could not wait to see what was going to happen next. And then the 24 hour wait before I was to watch the next one I thought about nothing else followed by the third 24 hours after the second. It was a very special 3 days discovering this masterpieces for the first time.,positive
"It truly lives up to its persona as being 'one of the best American films ever made'. The Godfather is a great example of a perfect movie, the story and characters come to life with this authentic cast of actors. This film pretty much represents the 'crime drama' genre and sets a clear example of how a book should be developed onto screen. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give extraordinary performances as father and son in a dying crime family; I struggle to pick anything out that I dislike about this film, a pure masterpiece.",positive
I recommend watching this film of its gangster 1940s culture.Its definatly my favourite of the 3 part series and i rated it 4 and a half stars as i found only some of it very boring.,positive
"Excellent 1972 movie about an Italian American Mafia family, the Carleones based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo. At 175 minutes long it has always put me off but I would agree it is certainly one of the best films I have ever seen. It explores not only the gangster angle that you would associate with a Mafia film but the family angle that sways the attitude of one of the central characters Michael (Al Pacino) from a fully fledged 'civilian' US war hero to eventual Godfather of the Carleone family. The casting is fantastic and contributed to the Oscar awards and nominations. They include a grainy voiced Marlon Brando (Don Carleone not Gerel from Superman), James Caan as older brother Sonny Carleone, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire as well as the already mentioned Al Pacino as Mike. The cinematography of Sicilly, post war New York and set pieces including a horses head in somebody's bed, Sonny being machine gunned and a sunny wedding with Don indoors listening to requests for help from desperados are all memorable. The whole film helped skillfully by director Francis Ford Coppull. Go on make the effort and watch it. Who dislikes this film? I watched with the subtitles it certainly helped overcome some of the hard to understand dialogue. Perhaps twenty minutes could have been minced off the end? My only small criticism. Prego!",positive
"Grade - C+ 'The Godfather' is commonly regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made...so why did I just think it was 'good'? It's certainly well shot, and well acted (although Brando has been better, honestly), and the first 90 minutes are pretty solid. However, the huge leaps in time are both unexpected and annoying, and quite frankly at nearly 3 hours, by the end I'd sort of lost interest. It has many redeeming qualities and can safely be called a good movie. But a masterpiece, I think not.",negative
In one word... Masterpiece.,positive
It goes on a tad too long but for all it gets right its hard to fault it to much. Grade: A-,positive
Transcendence to the early twentieth century pezzonovante era is inevitable while watching the movie. The intensity of organized crime has been depicted through the prism of one family. There is conspicuous silence which reverberates along with cold blooded violence through the entire journey. The movie intertwines intelligence and emotions in a seamless narrative. The confident divulgence of enemies plans of one's assassination by Godfather and his son seems so surreal yet riveting. The impeccable tandem of baptism and murder provide a fitting testimony to hypocrisies that dwells across all walks of life in the storyline.,positive
The greatest film in cinema.,positive
"The Godfather is not just a classic, it is one of the all time greats. Perfect acting, great direction, just a little too bland at some points.",positive

"The Godfather(1972) Starring: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Al Martino, Gianni Russo, John Cazale, Morgana King, Lenny Montana, Richard Bright, Alex Rocco, Vito Scotti, Julie Gregg, Simonetta Stefanelli, Jeannie Linero, John Martino, Corrado Gaipa, Franco Citti, and Saro Urzì Directed By: Francis Ford Coppola Review An offer you can't refuse. You know like the Jurassic Park movies whenever I would tell any who saw The Godfather that I loved movies but never saw The Godfather, they would say to me ""what is wrong with you?"" It took me forever to get to this film because I've been wanting to watch this for a while and I've seen Citizen Kane before this movie. But finally I've seen it and I like it more then Citizen Kane. The story spans the years from 1945 to 1955 and chronicles the fictional Italian-American Corleone crime family. When organized crime family patriarch Vito Corleone barely survives an attempt on his life, his youngest son, Michael, steps in to take care of the would-be killers, launching a campaign of bloody revenge. The Godfather(1972) is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coopola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafai entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character, during the entire film his life-long professional criminal does nothing that, in context, we can really disapprove of. We see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped in prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud, or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking is corrupt. The story views Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell, in a way its shaped the public perception of Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villain's are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael(Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against family."" It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any responsible request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately. This is indeed up their with one of the best films of all time and I loved this film. I'm giving The Godfather a five out of five.",positive
"cinegeek.de Our Daily Free Stream: Francis Ford Coppola - The Godfather Legacy. Was macht Francis Ford Coppola heute? Er hat keine Schulden mehr, baut Wein an und kann so seine Filme aus eigener Tasche bezalhen. Wir zeigen heute die Doku The Godfather Legacy. - Es ist merkwürdig: Als Francis Ford Coppolas Meisterwerk 1972 ins Kino kam, nahm man das Gangster-Epos wahr als Film, der alles Glamouröse einer solchen Gangster-Existenz einfach negierte. Was blieb übrig? Fragwürdige Loyalitäten einer gewalttätigen Nachbarschaft in Brooklyn. Heute gilt The Godfather als der glamouröseste aller Mafia Thriller. Mario Puzos Vorlage aber erzählt nicht von der grossen weiten Welt des Verbrechens. Er konzentriert sich auf die Innenansichten eines kleinen Kreises. In The Godfather kennt jeder jeden. Anders als in Puzos Roman, identifizieren wir uns in Coppolas Verfilmung mit Don Corleone und seiner Familie. Das liegt nicht daran, dass wir aufeinmal vorhätten, auch einen Bandenkrieg anzuzetteln. Es liegt daran, dass wir Corleone von Beginn an folgen. The Godfather selbst ist dabei gar nicht der zentrale Charakter des Films. Die Aufmerksamkeit hat sein jüngster und strahlendster Sohn Michael, der die Position seines Vaters versteht, dessen altmodische Existenz aber revidiert. Der Pate steht ausserhalb - die nachfolgende Generation wird seine Geschäfte hoffentlich legitimieren. Wer den Roman liest, wird sich wundern, weshalb Michael die Hauptfigur ist? Ich denke, es ist der einfachste Weg, zum Herzen von Puzos Geschichte vorzudringen. Im Grunde handelt der Roman davon, wie die Macht innerhalb der Familie weitergegeben wird. Marlon Brando gibt Don Corleone als gerissenen alten Mann, den nichts und niemand brechen kann. Al Pacino spielt Michael, der diesen Charakter brillant entwickelt. Dennoch: Jeder erinnert sich zuerst an Brando. Seine keuchende, stets flüsternde Stimme, seine Physis - ein Mann, der die Macht so sehr gewohnt ist, dass er niemanden mehr von seiner Stärke überzeugen muss. Es ist nicht das Makeup, das Brando zu Corleone werden lässt - es ist sein Spiel! Dennoch erstaunlich, wie es gelang, seine Wangen so aufzublasen, dass Brandos Gesicht bewegungslos erstarrt! Als ich Puzos Roman noch einmal las, bemerkte ich, dass seine schriftstellerischen Qualitäten nicht besonders ausgeprägt sind. Dafür gelangen ihm einige denkwürdige Szenen, die alle im Film auftauchen. Tatsächlich lässt Coppola keine dieser Tötungs-Sequenzen aus! Coppola verpasste The Godfather den richtigen Stil, den passenden ""Look"" und darf als einer der wenigen Filme gelten, der seine Vorlage übertrifft! Coppolas Entscheidung, The Godfather in der Vergangenheit, in den 40er Jahren spielen zu lassen, tut ihr übriges: The Godfather lebt von den glatten Erscheinungen, den prächtigen Limousinen und den Fedoras der Nachkriegszeit. The Godfather stellt auch ein Experiment des Kameramanns Gordon Willis dar: Alle Farben wirken braunstichig, genauso wie alte Zeitungen aussehen. Da das Werk drei Stunden lang ist, bedarf es keiner Eile. Wie Don Corleone Charakter, für den die Zeit keine Rolle spielt, ist das Epos inszeniert und nur so entfaltet es seine ganze Wirkung. Ich bilde mir sogar ein, dass einige der Figuren und ihrer Beziehungen untereinander nur verständlich werden, wenn man auch das Buch gelesen hat. Obwohl - die Art und Weise, wie sie sich ansehen, sagt mehr aus, als umständliche Erklärungen!",positive

"What can I say about one of the most remarkable films of cinema history ?, certainly any list you seek, is the Rolling Stone or syndicated actors, ""Godfather"" will be in the top 3 at least, not is less, see and witness the best that cinema has to present an extremely slow movie, 3 hours, but at the same time it is fast and keep it captivates and holds the viewer deeply during the I80 minutes I80 this that are pure tension, drama, suspense and intrigue, with impeccable script by Francis Ford Coppola which is based on the book by Mario Puzo (which also has a stake in the script), Godfather is one of those cases where the film is better than the book, as I had before, his script is impeccable, his rhymes triumphant narratives, their rhythm is perfect, the constitutions of their actions are a class of cinema, Marlon Brando makes a sPECTACULAR interpretation as little before seen in the movies, playing Don Vito Corleone he steals the movie scene in the first act, showing all his logic on ethics of the mafia, while its violence and brutality, in the second and third act who steals the film is the amazing Al Pacino doing an interpretation as ingenious when Brando in the role of Michel, Al Pacino gives an acting show, remained well contained, and completely changing your look from the beginning of the film, you really believe in Michael, the film photography is amazing and helps perpetuate the half dozen scenes that went to the story that this film contains, it is worth mentioning the scenes in Italy and baptized, as well the first 30 minutes of the film, the soundtrack is one of those that you listen and already feel the tone of the film, you play with music, and its perfection, worth highlighting Nino Rota for the soundtrack. Well, Godfather is a film that talks about mafia, drugs, death, violence, illegality, corruption, addiction, etc .. yet he is beautiful, beautiful, it seems ennoble impure acts at the same time cause the same disclaimers, but end you delights and surprises, because it also talks about family, loyalty, friendship and acceptance, watch this movie, even if it is your movie genre, at least try, there's no way you leave the loss with this work as striking the 7 art.

"Turning a low budget proyect with low credibility among the producers themselves into one of the best films of all time, Francis Ford Coppola crafted this masterpiece based on Mario Puzo´s best selling novel by the same name. Feature then young actors Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, Marlon Brando delivered hands down the best performance of the film and one of the most iconic movie characters of all time as the big time crime boss Vito Corleone.

"Long boring overrated crap. But it really picked up around, oh never. Just another film people tell you is good. Supposed to be a classic. Not even close. There are much better films from around that same time period, and older. Marlon Brando has a stroke, then learned his lines, then had another stroke, mumble--cks his lines, people get impressed. It was a lot of cinematography without actually being a film. If you edited it for content, the whole movie series would be a half hour. No sense of pacing. I would say that the characters were boring, but everything was boring. I think that this is just another example of a movie where the critics say jump, and the audience says how high, then everyone just ws each other. There is not a slower moving movie made that exists.",negative

Marlon Brando effortlessly portrayed the cool calm composure of Vito Corleone, whilst Al Pacino was great as Michael Corleone. His transformation from family outsider to ruthless mob boss was believable and realistic. The Godfather also felt authentic from the sets to the costumes.

"Well many know I am not that into movies pre-90's. Its just to before my time and hard for me to get past the dated effects, storylines, and cheesiness. A few exceptions are Star Wars and Indiana Jones. I really enjoy those and they hold up really well. So i was finally forced to watch the Godfather and I have to say ... i still don't get it. I know I am in the minority and everyone considers it to be a masterpiece but i just could not get into it. It has some good acting and a few shock moments but the story just wasn't that exciting. It jumps around in time a lot which can be confusing and there are a lot of characters to keep up with. I also don't understand a lot of the characters motivations or why they do what they do. Maybe I just didn't watch it that intently ... which is true... i was bored from the get go and had a hard time staying focus during its almost 3 hour runtime! May its just me ... but I just wasn't blown away like I thought I would be. It was okay. Nothing special.",negative

"A true classic. I watched this film often with my father. I even bought dad the movie. My dad told me the details of the movie were close to the book, which makes for a great movie. The Godfather has a good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. The sub stories of family, loyalty, greed, relationships, is a great mix. The artistic style by Francis Ford Coppola make the film memorable. The tragic story of Michael being pulled into the Mafia is a bitter sweet story. Great movie to watch with a glass of vineo! 5 stars.",positive
"Well, it is long and slow, but definitely a solid movie. I think the rating wouldn't be as high if it was released today, but I can appreciate its accomplishment when released in 1972. There is really no character development except for Michael (Al Pacino) and even that is very thin. This is the greatest detriment to this movie b/c its purpose is to chronicle the passing of the torch from father to son. Looking forward to Part 2 to hopefully fill this void.",negative
"Power. Family. Commitment. This cinematic classic balances ruthless, calculated killing against sweet, tender moments of family bliss. Coppola deftly weaves the tale of an innocent in a family of sinners, who becomes a revered outsider due to attending college and becoming a war hero. Whilst many respect Don Corleone for leading an empire of illegality with a code of honour, it is his bright son Michael who ultimately shines. Brando's gruff, stylistic figurehead is matched for penachÃ© by Pacino's transformation from war hero to war monger. It is Coppola's deft handling of tender moments that provides gravitas to The Godfather. Moments such as Michael's Sicilian flame lovingly caressing her necklace gift, to Don Corleone playing monster games with his grandson. These moments resonate, transforming brutal thugs into real people. Real, dangerous people.",positive

"I was roughly twenty years away from even being conceived when The Godfather came out. Growing up as a film nut, I often heard of The Godfather as possessing a sort of mythic status which few films made after 1955 possess. I first watched it back close to ten years ago as a 12 year old, never fully getting the story with the film falling into the ""great film that I didn't appreciate"" category until a month or so back when I got the Coppola restoration Blu-Ray and realized as an adult how fantastic of a film it truly was. The Godfather works so well because it isn't a film that kisses it's own ass on a variety of sub-levels. Francis Ford Coppola went out of his way not to make the film one that glorifies the Mafia in anyway, but still realized what a magnificent project it was. It begins in celebration and ends as the first part of the trilogy in bitter-sweet victory and tragedy for the Corleones with Michael having slowly morphed into a totally different character by the end and the Corleone family itself having endured tragedy after tragedy. Depending on if you're selective to certain genres of movies -- particularly crime and heist thrillers -- the 1970s were either a fantastic time with the New Hollywood group of directors, or a pitiful time where the Anti-Hero was all the rage. I've always tried to keep a foot in both camps for the most part, but if a film like this doesn't make you at least sit there as the credits role, musing in thought like Indiana Jones after being given a clue by a recently-killed shaman or anti-Nazi spy the first time you watch it, then I'm not sure you really know how to appreciate films and movies as art and not just entertainment. There's so many ways this film just works so well; the first is that Coppola always had a way of making the cinematography and direction style look both extravagant, but also bleak at the same time, partially through sun-faded cinematography (I'm just guessing) and also partially through the way the film itself was shot. As well as the fact that Coppola spared nothing when it came to deploying talented screen stars of the day to cast The Godfather, leading Marlon Brando to find international success once more with his portrayal of Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as the reluctant, but eventual successor to his father Vito, Michael Corleone, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, and of course, a pre-Rocky Talia Shire as Connie Corleone. These cast members in particular stand out in their performances and convey a sort of detached emotion which makes the film so great (if you need clarification on this, the scene where Vito overlooks his own son's body in the morgue is a prime example). Although it is by far the best instalment in the Godfather trilogy, the film itself does suffer from a few key points which I've never been able to reason out why they were included. Specifically the whole sequence involving Johnny Fontaine and the Woltz horse fiasco which has no real involvement in the over-arcing storyline. However with how spectacular of a film it is overall, I'm not going to sit here and bitch about it any further.",positive

A must see instant classic that definitely makes my top ten films of all time.,positive

"Great acting, interesting plot line and great script. I can't say it is my favourite movie of all time, however I can see why it is considered as such by many. Verdict: B+",positive
The G.O.A.T of all mob movies!,positive
Epic from start to finish. A must for all to see.,positive
I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. Watch this film.,positive
Boring!!!!! Don't waste your time!,negative
I can't believe a Marlon Brando movie is taking a back seat to Oz on the top 100 list of this website. It's the very epitome of the word bull$#%@.,positive
The GodFather was way too long almost 3 hours long the most longest the standard edition of Lord of the Rings Return of the King,negative
It's the Godfather! Enough said,negative
Perfect. Nothing else can describe The Godfather.,positive
"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.",positive
"The Godfather is an incredible movie with hardly any flaws, it has great performances, is well directed and well written. The Godfather is one of the best movies in the entire world.",positive
I'm gonna give you a rating you can't refuse.,positive
The pinnacle of good movies.,positive
Greatest piece of film iv'e ever seen.,positive
I can't find anything wrong with The Godfather. It's an intelligent movie that hooks you in from the very beginning. The gripping seriousness of many of the scenes makes them feel real.,positive
"A true classic that is worth re-watching, as I did. It's a timeless piece as both this film and the sequel bring to life the rise of a crime family from 1901 to 1959. Every element of the film was obviously very well thought out and impeccably executed helping to create a cinematic masterpiece of epic proportions. I re-watched it in January 2016 together with the sequel making the story more revealing than ever before.",positive
"Una joya del cine. Buena historia, buenos guiones, buenas actuaciones. Magnífica.",positive
Perfect. No other way to put it.,positive
"My number 1 rule is ""Never judge a film until you've seen it twice."" After re-watching this and its sequel, i have come to the unwavering opinion that these two films are the best films mankind has created. For those who are fans of ""Guns and Glory"" films, this is not your movie. For those who actually like solid story telling, exemplary production qualities, and films that continue to impress with every view, you have found the crown jewel of cinema history.",positive
"Based on the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola created one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian mafia family. Definitely worthy of the term masterpiece. It's not often I watch a three-hour film and think to myself ""That could have been longer"". My only complaint on both the novel and the film is the role women play. As a proud feminist I considered it an insult that women were portrayed as subordinate characters, either dedicated to their husband or dedicated to satisfying men. But that didn't detract me from my overall enjoyment of the book and the film. A timeless classic and a defining film in the history of cinema.",positive
"This isn't just a saga of an American crime family, it's the transformation of a single human being: Michael Corleone, played perfectly by Al Pacino. ""The Godfather"" is a story about the corruption of a single human being, and all the lives that it touches. Epic in scope and scale, perfect in execution, and intimate in character and story. Simply put, this is the greatest film in the history of American cinema.",positive
"The Godfather was not what I expected it to be. The highly recommended novel and Academy Award-winning film did not meet my expectations. I had to force myself to watch the whole film and even after doing that the only way for me to describe the first part of this organised-crime saga is: 'bearable'. I found the storyline very confusing, the different point of views should have given me a better insight on the Don Corleone family but what they did to me is confuse me even more. Maybe I just can't relate to Italian mafia families. What I did find very impressing is that the film followed the book fairly closely. The film didn't deal with Vito Corleone's early life like the book did though.",negative
The greatest gangster movie of all time!!! Brando is superb Caan and Pacino excellent. Great storyline. It is a must see if for some strange reason you haven't already done so,positive
The best movie ever!,positive
A monumental creation.,positive
"Continually lauded as one of the best films ever made, it in fact amounts to little more than three hours of men sitting around talking. Imagine the most boring meeting you have ever had at work, double the boredom and then imagine it went on for three hours, then you start to get some idea of what watching The Godfather is like.",negative
"My favourite movie! Number one on my list! It's got action, drama and humour. It is s movie to watch if you like cinema!",positive
"Better than any movie you'll see in this day and age. A timeless classic, with brilliant writing, acting and directing.",positive
It's a movie that you never get tired of watching it. Marlon Brandon's acting combined with a great direction made this movie a masterpiece of all time.,positive
"Absolutely stupendous. Masterpiece among all films. There's no logical reason to dread this film, unless you are illogical.",positive
"Spectacular. Every time I see it, it gets better. From its flawless direction, to its exceptional score, to its (near-)flawless script, I have no doubt ""The Godfather"" is one of the best movies ever made.",positive
Absolutely great! Would you like to watch a movie to learn about the intricacies of politicians and different strategies? Would you like to learn different effective ways to influence people? This is the movie for you.,positive
"Textbook on lighting, atmosphere, scoring, acting, and set design.",positive
"Un film extraordinaire, un des plus grands films de l'histoire des cinéma.",positive
Just not my kind of movie.,negative
"The Godfather is a testament that a wonderful story sometimes makes a great movie to a fantastic one. Driven by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino performances and the rest of the cast that bring to life the gangster world to a perfection. In the end, the only thing that hasn't age well is running time besides it, its a perfect film.",positive
"I'm not sure the mob in real life is this out of hand, but it's a very good film nonetheless.",positive
"One of the gold standards of modern world cinema, it plays today with as much intensity, depth, subtlety and complexity as when it was first released.",positive
"Lets be honest, people are fascinated by the Mafia whether we want to admit it or not. Often said to be the greatest movie ever made The Godfather gives us a look into the glory days of the mafia. When the gangster lifestyle had a mystique and prestige about it. Even though they were still a bunch of criminals, there was a strong sense of family and loyalty to that family. The Godfather introduces us to some of the most iconic characters to ever hit a movie screen, mainly Don Vito Corleone portrayed by Marlon Brando. This movie is deeply layered and acted to perfection by all of those casted. This movie is truly epic but overall it is actually a great story and interesting plot. People knew about the mafia at the time The Godfather hit theatres, but they were always in the shadows and you were never really certain what exactly it was that they did or were involved with. Yes, the Godfather borderlines on glorifying these gangsters, but that is for the sake of making a movie that is entertaining. If you want a glimpse at what the mafia is really like and what it has turned to over the years turn your attention to The Sopranos, the most authentic piece of entertainment on the mob ever made. Even the characters in The Sopranos joke around and quote lines from The Godfather. It has become almost mythology and heralded as the best movie ever.",positive
Awesome movie you have to see Marlon Brando kills it!,positive
Simple the best picture in the history of modern film-making.,positive
"This is a classic movie. With unforgettable lines, characters, scenes, and more. It is an all time favorite and is a all time classic. Sure, it is not my favorite movie and is extremely long and hard to finish it in one day, you will come out with a good attitude.",positive
"Greatness all around. Excellent allegory on capitalism and the American way of life: family first, fuck society.",positive
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!,positive
"""The Godfather"" is written and filmed by ""Francis Ford Coppola"" and ""Mario Puzo"" in an incredible way to make the audience enjoy/care for a ""Mafia"" family and is definitely one of cinema's greatest movies. Set in the 1940's the plot to ""The Godfather"" is that ""Don/Vito Corleone"" portrayed by ""Marlon Brando"" is facing trouble with other mafia families. His youngest son ""Michael Corleone"" goes into the family business. The movie open with the ""Don"" being asked to get justice for what has happened a young innocent teenage girl. This scene is great; it shows how ""Vito Corleone"" is a very respected man and doesn't do anything unless he knows it's for a good cause. Throughout the most of the movie the audience is shown how ""Michael Corleone"" develops as a character and becomes closer to his family and the relationship between him and his father is truly gold. These scenes make the film more and more dramatic. The film's climax is very dark and violent which is actually very unexpected. ""Al Pacino"" gives one his greatest performances of his life as ""Michael Corleone"". And ""Marlon Brando"" as the almighty ""Don/Godfather"" is just a terrific performance to say the least. The music composer for ""The Godfather"" the late ""Nino Rota"" exceeds in composing sad and dramatic Italian music. One of the best things that make ""The Godfather"" so great is the way it's filmed; the movie uses black and brown colours to make scenes look stunning. For example the film's climax it shows a close up of ""Al Pacino"" whilst also showing many others being murdered. If you are a person who enjoys some of ""Francis Ford Coppola's"" films then I definitely recommend you watch ""The Godfather"" as it is perfect this is due to perfect acting, stunning visuals and a terrific film score. I give 1972's ""The Godfather"" a 10/10.",positive
My favorite film of all time. Every scene is visionary and every line is perfect,positive
"A movie of great tension from the very beginning till the end, impressive and attractive throughout. Climax with Michael baptized, notifying audience of his new beliefs and doings. Very clever screenwriting with a sound development capturing and presenting tragedy on Michael and his mental battle in lively manner.",positive
Perfect. That is all. There is so much more I could add but why would I when the entire nearly 3 hours run time is completely perfect and speaks for itself.,positive
I have included this movie on my ad hoc worst movie ever list and have taken a pledge to never watch any of it again if I can help it. In order for me to be an authority on it I would have to watch the whole movie which I did not do because it was so boring and awful.,negative
"The best movie that Iv'e ever seen, by far! The Godfather gives the word masterpiece a whole lotta new meaning with its perfect story telling and godly amazing script, music and acting. Godfather is the definition of a movie and arguably the best movie ever, for now, is the best ever for me...:)",positive
One of the all-time greats. This cast is so loaded with talent they would have been a much watch with a poor story. This story is so far from poor. It is compelling. The film was masterful in all aspects. It has aged like a fine wine. Bravo!,positive
A classic a movie that all filmmakers who strive to adapt novels to films should watch,positive
"While occasionally meandering, The Godfather is a brilliantly told story and intriguing at every time, and it's not hard to see why some consider it the greatest film of all time.",positive
"Layers of intrigue, compelling characters, and multiple plot twists make this epic (almost three hours) thoroughly enjoyable without boring.",positive
"It's a classic, obviously, but it's a damn good classic. It's long and not for the weak-willed, but it was near perfect. It was cold, calculated, violent, sharp, and a great character study. On to the sequel!",positive
"This, and its two sequels, are the best films ever made. 'Nuf said.",positive
"Is The Godfather the greatest film ever made? I would say yes, even though it's not my personal favorite movie. It's my second favorite because the acting is at it's best. The Godfather has arguebly the best cast ever. Marlon Brando giving his best performance and the worthy oscar win. AL Pacino with an also great performance that should have won him an oscar for best supporting actor. James Caan and Robert Duvall have great chemistry. The Godfather is also a great directed movie. Francis Ford Coppola knew what to put in the movie and the pacing was great even for a nearly 3 hour film. It felt like a 2 hour movie. And the score of the movie is one of the greatest scores ever. The Godfather has emotion,tension, and everything you want in a film.",positive
One of the few exceptional films Hollywood has to offer.Marlon Brando gives a ravishing perfomance.,positive
Boring and a waste of my time,negative
"Look, I know I'm gonna alienate a bunch of people with my opinion on this film. And don't get me wrong, I really, REALLY enjoyed it. It just didn't blow me away like I thought it would. I think, in part, that has something to do with the constant hype of it being ""one of the greatest films ever made."" If I'm being honest, Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990) is a much better mafia film. However, I can appreciate this movie for what it is, what it did for cinema, and the accreditation it gets for the true genesis of the mafia genre. But what a film, though! I mean, it seriously was a great movie. The story was intriguing and gripping, the characters were believable and somehow likable despite their despicable acts. It was incredibly fascinating watching the downward spiral of Al Pacino's character from WWII veteran to Don Corleone. And Marlon Brando... setting the bar for acting for years to come. The subtleties in his performance won me over with him, like [SPOILERS] the scene where he finds out about his son, Sonny's, murder. His reaction speaks a thousand words, and without speaking, you can visibly that a little piece of him died with his son. Overall, a really influential and interesting film that didn't quite hit as hard as I had hoped, but still gripped me enough that I was thoroughly entertained for the three-hour run time. Perhaps a second viewing will help me appreciate the film more.",positive
"No, I don't think this is the best movie ever made, but through the 3 hour runtime..the film is completely flawless",positive
Awesome movie! One of the best mafia's films,positive
Watching one of my all-time favorites right now.,positive
Seen it probably 1000 times but it feels still fresh...a classic,positive
just as good as i remembered it,positive
Will change your life.,positive
The best movie of Godfather's serie.Marlon Brando's performance is perfet.This is a movie that everybody will still talk in many years.,positive
One of my all time fav movies a classic astonishing,positive
"Fantastic but the third act could be much stronger. Still, brilliantly done and a very good movie with great characters.",positive
Underwhelming film with Overwhelming reviews. Some great scenes and some interesting drama. It really all comes down to the slow pace and scenes that dont really go anywhere. There isn't that much variety to look at for 3 hours the lighting is too dark and the line delivery is almost impossible to hear without subtitles. The real thing is that the story I found to not be too interesting but then again mobster movies are usually not a favorite of mine,negative
"The classic, 1972 godfather, written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola is the idea that family is the most important, and how 1940's gangsters would follow orders by the head of their family, to protect others. This is a very important film for the industry as a whole. The acting is phenomenal, and is an absolute delight to re watch as it feature such bad ass yet chilling motives from a classic perspective.",positive
"Going into this movie I had 3 worries: it was going to be extremely overrated, it wasn't going to be entertaining, and I wasn't going to understand the plot of the film. None of these things turned out to be true, and I'm very delighted by this. A film being called the best movie of all-time definitely will be called overrated by most, but this film is just excellent in every aspect. Its story is as masterful and interesting as any other great film from this day and age. The acting is beyond good, as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan absolutely blew me away with their performances. Also, the action sequences and suspense were very well done, as I was on the edge of my seat during these instances. Usually I'm not fond of films made before 1980, but I made an exception to watch this on because of its critical acclaim. I was scared that the film would be boring because of a combination between this and its near 3 hour duration, but I couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen. So all in all, The Godfather is a fast-paced, entertaining film with stellar performances. Although I wouldn't call it the best film of all time, The Godfather is indeed a masterpiece.",positive
The greatest film in motion picture history and a masterpiece of unmatchable caliber.,positive
We all know why this is amazing. I don't need to explain.,positive
"Mafia films are not excatly my type of films, yet The Godfather is very well-done with a subtle but powerful script, the realistic and natural cinematography paints the harsh mood of a 40's New York and Italy's calm and rustic landscapes; and, of course, phenomenal and mesmerizing performances by all the actors but, specially, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The latter surpassing my expectations.",negative
five stars. that is all.,positive
No wonder why this is known as the definitive gangster movie.,positive
Para mi la mejor pelÃ­cula de la historia!,positive
"7,5. That's one big overated movie. The fight scene with Sonny and Carlo... just awful, punch flying through the air. Many cheap transitions, fade, cross fade, nothing really astonishing. I found better Goodfellas, I don't understand that this movie got a 9,2 out of ten by the critics.",positive
Best mafia movie!!!!,positive
"Magnificently directed and engaging in ways many gangster titles struggle to be, The Godfather lives up to its reputation. Only nit-picks are the audio quality in some of the dialogue scenes (with obvious ADR), and James Caan's inability to convincingly punch someone in the face.",positive
The most overrated movie I have ever seen in my entire life.,negative
The greatest movie of all time!,positive
Probably the greatest movie ever made.,positive
"I have finally seen The Godfather! And I am really glad I did! I've been postponing this movie for a very long time due to it being almost 3 hours long and I didn't find the idea of a mafia gang that interesting. But, since it's summer and all I do now is watch movies and shows, I decided to watch all the long movies I've been wanting to. Starting with The Godfather. I was scared of thinking it could've been overrated, but it really wasn't. This is truly a masterpiece and a game changer of cinema! The story is very complicated and sometimes I didn't understand some of the plot points but I've rewatched some scenes after watching the whole movie and I understood everything. The characters are very well structured. There aren't many characters left out of the main story, they all somehow tie in to the plot. The soundtrack is great and it fits the movie's atmosphere perfectly! The acting is brilliant. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando really do stand out. Many characters die and all of the deaths I found unexpected and just so well done that sometimes I couldn't believe it happened while watching the movie, especially Vito's end. That was amazing. All in all, a brilliant and beautiful movie with great characters, great acting and a great, but complicated, story make an almost 3 hour long movie seem much shorter. I would deffinetely recommend watching this movie!",positive
"I'm not quite sure why everyone thinks this movie is so great. It's slow, sometimes boring and confusing without much direction. It's hard to keep track of all the characters and tell what's going on sometimes. Marlon Brando was really good though.",negative
"Truly a CLASSIC. Many popular lines came from here. ""It's not personal. Just business.""",positive
Al Pacino delivers an outstanding performance which reminisces for ages afterwards.,positive
Classic movie a liked it a lot and it one of the best movies I ever seen,positive
"The godfather is a remarkable film that improved the Box Office in 1972! It's a movie that audiences will never refuse! Definitely rate it 99 out of 100! One of the greatest movies I've ever watched! 175 minutes of graphic violence, gifted acting especially from Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, and of course, Al Pacino! Mafia is the true heart of the movie!",positive
"Francis Ford Coppola directed and co-wrote with Mario Puzo The Godfather, a film so masterfully crafted, it is impossible unless you are a depressive cynic not to at least care for it. Taut and gripping, this masterpiece makes you feel for fundamentally bad people, and in this manner, puts graphic violence second to character. Gorgeous cinematography and flawless editing and shot composition paves the screen in this film. One of the greatest of all time.",positive
"Amazing, captivating, has you cheering for a rat.",positive
very interesting story...,positive
crime-family drama masterpiece,positive
One of the best gangster films ever made next to GoodFellas ð???,positive
Fuck Standley Kauffman. He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.,positive
"Simply put, one of the greatest films ever.",positive
Puntaje Original: 9.5 El Padrino es de esas películas que por mas que pasen los años siempre trascenderá generación tras generación. Una película de culto que todo amante del cine debe ver.,positive
"The Godfather is a movie done so well, it's just summed up in one word: ""Fantastic"" It's the first film seen to have EVERYTHING done so well without any problem slowing it down or making it tedious. Its tone, its pacing, the sets, well done and FANTASTIC characters, SUPERB acting, well done action, etc. And thanks to Mario Puzo and Director Francis Ford Coppola, they have made possibly one of Hollywoods greatest critical and commercial success of all time and made Marlon Brando's character into a ICON.",positive
Great movie with great acting good characters and interesting plot,positive
It was so realistic most of the main actors actually died for once in a movie I love mafia movies,positive
Got me into mafia movies.,positive
One of the best movies ever.,positive
"""DON'T MESS WITH THE Corleone!"" Now that statement says it all. Not much for this movie, though, it's just mobs and gangsters who build up a system, creates wonderful families and stories behind it. But what shines here is the brilliant execution that makes up one of the most beautiful movie masterpieces of our time. Al Pacino, James Caan, Duvall, Richard Castellano and Marlon Brando. Pure and natural, and it is just crazy to see these wonderful actors into what we defined as actual acting. The only flaws of the story is that you need to check out more of the story's characterization. Who in the hell is this guy? How did it happen then? How did it become like this? Questions arise through your mind as Coppola's genius directing really shows up with the movie. But the saturation and the profundity of its drama is just ""mob-fantastic"" genius. Love, treachery, selfishness and family. These were the subject that crosses your attention as The Godfather is one of the most beloved American movies of all time. Amazing cinematography, superb performances and most importantly a very memorable masterpiece that we ever enjoyed. I love the restored version and please I recommend to watch and purchase it on Blu-ray. 4.5 stars out of 5.",positive
The best! Can't beat this film!,positive
"Boring, slow, and nonsensical. Doesn't make sense how Michael would go from not wanting to be involved in the family business to killing two guys in cold blood without remorse. The second film was the best of this trilogy, though I would give that film like a 3-star rating.",negative
"Wanna know how great this movie is? I have it on VHS, DVD, Bluray, and I bought it on iTunes, this is definitely the greatest movie of all time.",positive

"If you've never heard of Don Corleone before, then I have no idea which rock you've been living under. The Corleone crime-family drama follows the personal evolution of some of cinema's greatest ever characters, and has one of the best ensemble casts of all-time. Caan, Duvall, Pacino, Brando, Keaton - amazing cast. Coppola's masterpiece is still immensely powerful.

"The greatest mafia film ever made, and one of the greatest films ever.",positive
"When released, the movie had potential. But for me The Godfather had one huge elephant sitting in front of the screen. And that elephant was pacing. The movie excels in all most every other aspect but it's the pacing which makes me dislike this movie a whole lot. It takes ages for anything to get done, there is little action or actually anything to attract the wandering attention of the audience. I could sleep through this movie (and I almost did). Now I understand that this is a subtle movie but there is a limit before it becomes pretentious and even even counter productive. Like I said, The Godfather has a lot of good aspect like the writing, the casting but I really wouldn't call this movie ""The perfect movie"" as many of the fans of this movie say.",negative
Tonally perfect and a pinnacle of filmmaking.,positive
Hands down the greatest movie of all time,positive
"""Someday -and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to say that there is a better classic than this. But until that day, accept this as the greatest gangster flick ever made""",positive
"It's a good film with lots of drama, betrayal and the love of a godfather. Too bad it's not my kind of film.",negative

fantastic storyline. noone could play the role of Vito and Mike better than Marlon Brando and Al Pacino,positive
"If there is one film that defines the gangster-film genre, it is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, ""The Godfather"". Perhaps best described as a twisted prodigal son story, ""The Godfather"" tells the tale of an honest man's decent to the criminal underbelly after inheriting the responsibilities of the mob from his father. The result is a dark and twisting narrative that is as captivating as it is ground-breaking. The entire cast gives excellent performances, but most especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Their performances really suck me in and are a big part of why the narrative is so captivating. They are given great dialogue to work with, and they deliver the dialogue just as greatly. ""The Godfather"" is the greatest gangster film of all time, and that is because Francis Ford Coppola knows how to tell a great story with vivid characters, and Brando and Pacino know how to bring those characters to life. I'm going to make you an offer you'd be crazy to refuse: go see ""The Godfather"". It'll be well-worth the three hour run time.",positive
Perfect from beginning to end!,positive
"The first third is great! Great character development and phenomenal acting! The second third is amazing! Everything is done absolutely perfectly! Then, we get to the last third of the movie and it's so freaking boring! I am so heartbroken because of that, because, I was loving the movie! The first two thirds were awesome, but the last third is, unfortunately, not very good and it really took me out of the experience. In short: ""The Godfather"" is an amazing movie, that really falls apart by the end. It's still a great movie, but it could have been amazing if the third act was done a lot better.",positive
"It gets better every year, a timeless classic",positive
"The most boring film ever created. Don't waste your time watching this horribly acted, directed and visually appalling movie.",negative
This most be the best movie ever. Ever one in the this movie it gangster. Not one character is good guy. Come one people this movie is shit. Who care if it is based on a true story. I don't think it is. How many History movies have 2 sequels. This is one of the worst movies from 1972. Stop hyping this crap. Do not see this awful movie.,negative
Cinematic perfection.,positive
"By far, hands down, no questions asked, my favorite movie of all time. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando absolutely crush it...a bucket list film (and series) for all...",positive
The movie that made Marlon Brando a legend. When you watch it you feel like you're in the presence of greatness. You make sure to sit up straight in your seat and pay your respects to the Don.,positive
"Still the classic tale of capitalism in America. To say we need more films like this is like saying we need more Hemingway, Mozart, and Da Vinci. James Caan chews the scenery hard as Sonny. Brando looks world-weary as Vito and Pacino steals the show as Michael. I know I'm not saying anything new here but this film is the reason the medium was invented.",positive
"Basically one of the greatest films ever made. If you haven't seen this yet, there's probably something wrong with you lol.",positive
The greatest film ever made.,positive
you can't look away from this movie...it's a masterpiece of filmmaking..,positive
The Godfather is the greatest film about the mob and one of the greatest films about family ever made.,positive
"Possibly (and according to Kubrick), the greatest movie ever made. The godfather lives up to its incredible reputation. Coppola's masterpiece.",positive
"The godfather is a film that gets a lot of praise, and I mean a lot. Many would call this the best movie ever made, this is a film that influenced cinema a film that is so iconic it has been parodied in shows like the Simpsons. I finally sat down to watch it and wow it really does deserve all that love. The Godfather is an outstanding film and easily one of the best films ever made. Just about everything works in this movie and there is quite a lot to talk about. The acting is absolutely outstanding. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and many more are all fantastic. Marlon Brando is just phenomenal as Don Corleone he's so brilliant, calm and menacing all at the same time. He also gave us one of the most famous lines in all of film. Al Pacino stole the show, I love seeing the character of Michael Corleone descend down this dark, violent route and by the end of the film he's a completely different character. All of the acting is great and there isn't a bad performance in the movie. The directing from Francis Ford Copolla is absolutely fantastic, the way he directs the scenes is so mesmerizing and with a different director this wouldn't nearly be as good as it is. The cinematography is so good it just sucks you in. I love the positions and angles the camera is in scenes. I love the final shot of the door closing its absolutely brilliant. The music is fantastic, it fits this type of film perfectly and just sucks you into scenes. This film is full of iconic lines, my favourite being 'Luka Brazi he sleep with the fishes' it's great but it's one of many. This film is full of brilliant scenes, for example my favourite is probably the dinner scene, it's a scene with a slow build up and is quite tense and has a fantastic pay off. I also love the Christianity scene, it's a calm but dark scene as its played at the same time as some very violent murders are taking place. I also love how tense this film is, you really don't know who to trust in the world they have set up its phenomenal. I only have one minor problem with the film and that is that I do find the scene with Michael hiding in Sicily a little long, but it's still watchable and not bad. The godfather is one of the best films of all time I would put it in my top 5 favourite films without a doubt. A+",positive
"thoughly compelling throughout, although wished that brando had more screen time and influence, didnt feel his authority and power was displayed other than what was spoken of him by others his dimise and handover was relatively weak. al pacino nails it however and is convincing ruthless.",positive

best movie ever made,positive
"Un capolavoro del cinema che ha donato un film che è un susseguirsi di scene iconiche: quella della testa di cavallo, la scena del favore richiesto al padrino, l'attentato a quest'ultimo mentre comprava le arance, la riunione dei boss mafiosi, la scena della pistola nascosta nel bagno etc etc. Inoltre c'è da aggiungere la metamorfosi del figlio (Al Pacino) che da ulteriore spessore e interesse verso questo film.",positive
"It's funny, if you talk to pretty much anyone around the globe about The Godfather, they know exactly what you're talking about. Whether they've seen it or not, they know exactly what you mean. Some of them will even muster up a quote or two. Such is the worldwide influence of Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The film revolves around the Corleone family, in particular Don Vito Corleone and his sons; Michael, Santino (Sonny) and Fredo and their involvement in a budding mob war. So why is this one piece of cinema so absolutely, world-changingly (yes that's a word... now) good? Let's have a look.  First of all, the script. Perfectly smearing the line between realistic and stylised, it is THE most quotable gangster movie of all time with lines like ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,"" ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes,"" etc. But it also gives the characters a depth which hundreds of other films have found hard to replicate. Each line is specially crafted for its character and is filled with rich subtext and double meanings. The realism factor means that lines aren't over stylised and polished to within an inch of their life, which helps to create an atmosphere of a slightly elevated reality.  The acting. It's not often that a filmmaker is granted the use of an ensemble quite as amazing as this, and they are all incredible. Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone has long since passed into cinema immortality as he mumbles his way through the script perfectly. For the most part he is calm, in control. But when moments of anger or sadness come along, he is explosive. His restraint throughout the film is top notch and it makes the more heightened emotional states that much more incredible. The best example of this is in when he's speaking with Johnny Fontane about his part in a film coming up. I'm surprised the screen doesn't shake every time. Al Pacino's Michael is a standout as well, with his cold, calculating personality and fierce protection of his family, as well as a sort of hidden danger inside of him which rears its head occassinally. There are so many layers to his character that you will not get it the first time around. Pacino is at one of the many peaks in his career in this film and its incredible to watch him do what he does.  The direction is fantastic as well. Coppola manages to keep the audience engaged over the entire epic 3 hours of run time with brilliant lighting and beautiful honeyed tones as well the darker shadowy moments in which nothing is certain. He captures the harshness in both the daytime and the night equally. Just the fact that he took on such an amazing project is kudos enough, that it worked is even better.  However, as I mentioned, it is 3 hours long, and often there are slow, very slow, moments. But hang in there and you'll be rewarded with having seen one incredible film.  Francis Ford Coppola's stylised, almost mystical, representation of the American Mafia is a timeless piece of cinema, the likes of which you'll only see every fifty years. Filled with amazing set piece after amazing set piece, if you haven't seen it yet, DO IT NOW!  Defining Scene:  What, are you kidding? The now immortalised horse's head scene. It'll get you everytime.",positive
One of cinemas greatest achievements. A must watch.,positive
"One of the greatest movies ever made. At nearly 3 hours long, this film breezes by before you know it. Paramount pictures actually had to demand more footage from director Francis Ford Coppola after he brought them a 2 & a half hour original 1st cut. Every actor is top notch, from Marlon Brando in his Oscar winning role as Don Vito Andolini Corleone, three co-stars Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone & Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor Oscars. John Cazale, Talia Shire & Diane Keaton are all in fine form as well. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards & winning 3 including Best Picture, this film was a huge influence on future mafia movies & TV shows including Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco & The Sopranos.",positive
¿Qué puedo decir de una de las películas más emblemáticas del cine que ya no se haya dicho antes? ¿Qué la vi en cine?,positive
An amazing story everything about it was beautiful nothing bad to say,positive
The best movie ever without a doubt,positive
"What could I say about this film? Every frame is just perfect. It has one of the best directings ever, and so are the performances. The director of photography creates an unforgettable atmosphere. The script is brilliant too. The OST could´t be more iconic and powerful. One unmissable masterpiece, one of the greatest films of all time. Must-see.",positive
"Widely regarded as the best movie of all time, ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece through and through! It earns the title as the best movie of all time because it most certainly is a fantastic mob film w/ the best performances in movie history, and certainly in my top 5 favorite movies of all time!",positive
What more is there to say? It's the Godfather!,positive
"Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo bring the famed-mafia novel to life. The Godfather is an excellent portrayal of power, betrayal and family. Beautifully written and stunningly executed, the film is a landmark motion picture with stunning performances (Brando, Pacino, Caan) that is still held up to this day as a timeless classic. 5/5",positive
"Arguably the best film ever made, The Godfather packs a powerful punch of drama, but may feel too long. But everything from the acting to the cinematography to the story can easily make for the run time.",positive
"A classic in every respect, but the sequel rules !",positive
One of the best movies ever made.,positive
"If I had to describe the Godfather it would be one of the greatest films ever made, period.The cast is Perfect with, in my opinion James Caan and Robert Duvall having the biggest empath ans giving the best performances.You can not have this movie with out Marlon Brando in his Oscar winning role.",positive
"A CLASSIC MASTERPIECE!!! The performance by the actor was beautiful, the script was beautiful, i loved how they shot it, The story is undoubtedly one of the greatest in it's genre, bravo !",positive
Is there a ten star rating?,positive
The only problem what i can find that's the second part is better. Anyway it's a great film.,positive
"I bet 90% of the reviews here say this is one of the greatest if not then the greatest films ever made and I can't stress it enough to say that they are all correct. I mean if you write a review and your missing the ""it's one of the greatest films ever made"" line then there is something wrong with you. From the beginning to the end this film keeps a nice natural flow to it. Which is super nice. The characters and the acting are super outstanding freaking awesome! The story is the key highlight of this film and it does not or a millisecond disappoint. Overall from it story to its acting this is a MUST MUST MUST see film. Truly is one of the greatest films of all time.",positive
"You know a film has historical weight when someone two generations removed can watch it and feel the power of the cast and the gravity of the words being spoken, despite having no connection to the era the film was made or set in. The Godfather is a true epic tragedy, a fantastic piece of art in which Coppola, Pacino, Brando and all the rest come together in a symphony that has impacted everything about movies ever since its conception and stands with Apocalypse Now as proof that Coppola is one of, if not the greatest directors of all time.",positive
An absolute classic. Rightly rated as one of the best movies ever made.,positive
"(I apologize for not reviewing this trilogy sooner, but I wanted to wait until I have seen all of them) ""Leave the gun; take the cannolis."" The first of The Godfather trilogy is one of the best mafia movies of all time. In fact, it is so accurate in its portrayal of mob families that actual mafia people confirmed it. The acting, especially between Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is electrifying. Almost everything in the movie is believable, and the screenplay is close to flawless. The Godfather definitely deserves all the praise it gets, and is in no way overrated.",positive
"The Godfather (O Poderoso Chefão, Francis Ford Coppola, 1972) - 10/10 Revisto. É meio chover no molhado dizer que esse filme é uma obra-prima. O Coppola e todos os envolvidos elevam ao infinito uma história excelente por si só. E o Brando? Icônico, imortal.",positive
"Over long, not much happened...still watchable but it's heavily overrated.",negative
"No arguing that this Francis ford coppola film is the best American film of all time. What can I say but only great things to describe this timeless mob classic. Francis ford coppola delivers in this compelling, intelligent, violent, and emotional film that is nothing but excellent! This film has no flaws except why did it have to end! I have seen a lot of movies but this one stands over all of them as the best. There's not much more I can say about how perfectly crafted this film is. I highly recomened this film to anyone.",positive
"The adaptation of screenplay, the music, the acting and direction was extraordinary, i'm not afraid to say it, this is the best film of all the times. 10/10",positive
"One of the greatest films ever made in modern world cinema, Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather' defines what a contemporary iconic masterpiece should be, spawning memorable quotes and cinematic moments that will stand the test of time for sure. The timeless tale of a Mafia family's rise and fall is told with such intelligent complexity and intense poignancy. With Marlon Brando's characteristically exceptional Don Vito, the central figure of one of New York's most notorious crime family, the essence of the story is tastefully brought out with humane themes such as the ever present stronghold of family values. The transformation of Al Pacino's prodigal son character from a reluctant outcast to a ruthless, powerful successor of the crime empire explains well of how a typical doe-eyed young man could change to his worst in times of hardship and desperation. In short, Coppola's gangster chronicle succeeds in being one film so great, so culturally significant that everyone agrees on.",positive
"-IGNORE THIS RATING 4/4 If not the greatest film ever made then certainly the best film of the decade. Based on Mario Puzo's pop culture novel, the film takes us through an odyssey of the Corleone family following the ""Don"" and the violence and loyalty of his family. Coppola's direction has yet to be matched. Winner of three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Actor, Screenplay (Coppola, Puzo).",positive
"If there was a movie that was a must see, there's no doubting it's this one.",positive
"I've never given a five-star rating before. ""Lives up to the hype"" is an understatement.",positive
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse -Don Corleone,positive
If you have not seen this movie you are living under a rock.best watched back to back. Simply stunning,positive
"Up there with Casablanca as the greatest ever films. De Niro, Pacino and Brando are peerless. What else can you say?",positive
My favorite movie of all time!,positive
"First, let me start with a confession: I'd never actually watched this movie before. Oh, I knew plenty about it - who hasn't - including the general plot outline, that it is commonly regarded as a masterpiece of American cinema, that certain scenes (and lines) are now part of cultural heritage, and that it has influenced plenty of later movies, but ever having actually watched it? Nope. Well, now I have, and I can say: boy, is it SLOW. I also don't get all the love poured on it: to me, it's just not that compelling a watch (it actually took me about 4 attempts to make it through), with Brando's mumbled delivery of his lines (urban legend has it he stuffed his mouth with cotton wool. That only holds true for his audition - for the actual filming, he wore a specially made mouthpiece) in particular extremely annoying. Now I can mark this one off my 'to watch' list, but doubt I'll do so (voluntarily) again.",negative
"""DON'T MESS WITH THE Corleone!"" Now that statement says it all. Not much for this movie, though, it's just mobs and gangsters who build up a system, creates wonderful families and stories behind it. But what shines here is the brilliant execution that makes up one of the most beautiful movie masterpieces of our time. Al Pacino, James Caan, Duvall, Richard Castellano and Marlon Brando. Pure and natural, and it is just crazy to see these wonderful actors into what we defined as actual acting. The only flaws of the story is that you need to check out more of the story's characterization. Who in the hell is this guy? How did it happen then? How did it become like this? Questions arise through your mind as Coppola's genius directing really shows up with the movie. But the saturation and the profundity of its drama is just ""mob-fantastic"" genius. Love, treachery, selfishness and family. These were the subject that crosses your attention as The Godfather is one of the most beloved American movies of all time. Amazing cinematography, superb performances and most importantly a very memorable masterpiece that we ever enjoyed. I love the restored version and please I recommend to watch and purchase it on Blu-ray. 4.5 stars out of 5.",positive
Words that best describe this movie are extremely boring and generic.,negative
My favorite movie and the best movie ever made. Period.,positive
'The Godfather' is the standard for which all films should be compared. It's compelling narrative led by many incredible performances and Francis Ford Coppola's exquisite direction makes this film a masterpiece of American cinema.,positive
"Gangster/criminal movies are always rated very highly, and this one is at the peak of them all. It's an amazing movie, contains everything critics want, and is therefore one of the most highly regarded films of all time. Do I agree: more or less. It's a wonderful film, don't get me wrong, and in its day any American Hollywood movie about criminals or cowboys was a instant classic that is still loved today. The Godfather is long, often slow, has some great characters, and a good script. It takes a bit to get going, as the first 20 minutes contain very little in terms of anything, other than meeting and getting to know characters. It is important for the future however, and after things move along at a better pace, but still not quickly. There's a lot of stuff I could cover but I won't be able too, so ill just say the basics. There's lots of characters, and it would take me a few watches to be able to recognize them all and remember them by name. It's not an action packed crime movie like we are used to, but instead a real look into a family of the mafia. The script is good for its time, as is the acting, although I prefer Al Pacino in Scarface. It's slow at the start, and stays pretty slow throughout the film unfortunately, but not boring. The ending left me wondering who had ordered the executions, and who had even been executed so I had to look it up for confirmation. Overall the movie is very good and well done, but there is some things to be desired. In my opinion not the blockbuster it should be considered, you would have to watch it for yourself to know if you agree with the extremely high ratings it receives.",positive
"Smart, violent, and dramatic. The Godfather has all the elements to make a better Hollywood movie!",positive
A most major work of art. Watch for those oranges.,positive
"The Godfather is a CGI crapfest with terrible performances. Marlon Brando, as usual, gives an emotionless and boring performance that lacks any characteristic of a real mob boss. The writing is terrible. The story goes nowhere. I want my money back.",negative
The true emotion of a real man.,positive
Who doesn't like a good Mob movie?,positive
The best mafia film they had ever made.,positive
The greatest mob movie ever,positive
"It's taken me 33 years to see this film, and I will probably never watch it again. That's mostly because this just isn't the type of movie I am into. However, it was fantastic. Didn't slow down even for the ""talking"" scenes. Beautifully made. It did the book credit, although there were a few parts that I would have liked to seen added to the movie.",positive
Probably the greatest movie ever made!!,positive
Do i really need to say anything,positive
"The Godfather is a terrific and original movie. The acting is great, Brando delivering a standout performance, and Pacino is also great. The direction is excellent, and the story is intricately and well crafted. The dialogue is very well written, and the camera work is great. It is an engaging movie, and the characters are well defined and the family dynamic is really good. Not much happens in the beginning, but the plot is building to some very memorable and excellently executed scenes. This is one of the best made movies of all time. It combines a well made story with interesting plot points and a stellar cast. My only complaint is that sometimes the pacing felt a little off, like they were trying to stretch the movie beyond its limits. Godfather gets 4.5/5 stars (A).",positive
Always good to watch over.,negative
A flawless cinematic experience. I would give it 5 if not for the fact that there were moments where it was not intense enough to hold my full attention.,positive
"This is really one of the greatest movies ever made. It's perfectly written and the performances, specially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are just amazing. The soundtrack really stands up by itself while a scene is ending. It's perfectly done.",positive
"I know a lot of people live this movie. This is only my personal review about this movie. If you like this movie, great! Don't read my review. Pretentious and slow, this film is the epitome of Coppola's unimaginative film making style. It is all together a watchable movie, but completely over rated and does not stand up against the sands of time. Brando's performance is laughably funny at times. Perhaps, if I were to have seen this movie when it came out my sentiments would have been different, but even if it were the first movie of its type, the characters and story have been parodied and repeated so many times, out of homage or otherwise, that the movie its self seems over the top. If this were truly a good movie, it would have stood up against these infractions and held its own over the course of the years.",negative
Good? Yes. Best movie ever made? No.,positive
Cinematic perfection in all forms that resonates in a timeless fashion with such pulchritude and master.,positive
"It seems that this film has no flaws, superb writing, superb story..",positive
"Slow and atmospheric, The Godfather reminds any and all movie-goers that mob films shouldn't necessarily centre around the basic gun fights and violence. Instead, the film centres around political positioning, heated and emotional confrontations (generally delivered verbally), and elongated discussions relating to 'the next move'. The film reminds us that the world of a mobster is not driven down a one dimensional, straight-line road; it is a difficult, winding path that seems to last forever. The Godfather seemingly does last forever, clocking in at a staggering three hours of run time, and whilst a number of pacing issues riddle the film, for the most part, a viewer should be engrossed for the humongous length. Director Francis Ford Coppola manages to keep the drama centred on the primary characters, and allows us as viewers insight into the minds of killers and crooks, near-never missing a beat. The discussions between higher-ups in this world of crime last minutes upon minutes, but the film refuses to budge in it's insistent, drawn out pace, and perhaps it is better for that. The basics are all exceptional: the cinematography, provided by Gordon Willis, seems remarkably simplistic but ever-yet beautiful; the lighting and sound design, whilst flawed at a few rare intervals, is generally exceptional; the acting, though, is the pivotal stand out, with Marlon Brando giving one of the best performances of not only his career, but of all time. Alongside Al Pacino, The Godfather stands out as one of the most perfectly acted films in all of cinema. Ultimately, the technicalities aren't going to resonate with a casual viewer; the story line, one of greed, corruption, morality and despair, is what is going to make an average movie-goer truly respect what Coppola has provided here. As someone viewing this for the first time in 2014, over 42 years after it's initial release, I can happily say that despite it's somewhat excessive running time, The Godfather is a masterpiece.",positive
Come on this is the bet film ever,positive
"The Godfather is one of the best and most successful crime/gangster films ever made and it is one of my personal favorite films of all time and it is also one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films. This movie is the story of the Corleone family who struggles to stay in power in the post war America of corruption, deceit and betrayal. Michael(Vito Corleone's son) soon takes over his father's position and he soon learns what its like to be a true mobster and Godfather at the same time as he takes his father's place. Watching this film is a superb experience and I really feel speechless after watching this film because this is one of the 70's most memorable movies ever made and its impossible to dislike The Godfather because there are so many moments that audiences and film critics will never forget once they watch this film. What makes The Godfather a very good film is that the film has a compelling and intriguing storyline that flows very well thanks to its superb pacing and outstanding execution the movie never gets boring at all. Since the movie was made back in the 70's I love the look of the old school settings of this movie like all of the buildings even the look of the film is marvelous and I love the look of the cars including the clothing style of the film is just stunning it gives you the feel of being what its like to live back in the 70's. The other highlights of this film is that the movie has a superb soundtrack and I love the main theme song of this film and since I first heard it now I was just amazed with it and the main theme song of the film fits well for the film's outstanding execution even the themes and tones are superb because the themes and tones are not only compelling but also very gritty and deep. Also the movie has so many memorable scenes that everyone will never forget(The death of Sonny in the tollbooth, The intense attack of Vito Corleone in the fruit stand, Vito Corleone's death, The Baptism murders, The vicious sequence where Carlo attacks Connie, The gruesome restaurant shooting, Luca Brasi's death, the death of Michael's wife and the mind blowing finale where Carlo gets garroted in the car)plus the editing is superb, the scenery is beautiful and the cinematography is stunning and outstanding at the same time oh and Francis Ford Coppola's directing is flawless and extremely balanced and focused at the same time. Now for the acting I seriously couldn't say a word about it because I am seriously speechless with the performances of the casts and the acting is also one of the film's true main highlights of this film and seriously all the casts did a very good job with their performances in the film and their performances deserves an Academy award and a Golden Globe Award as well. I'm serious about the performances of the casts. James Caan did a very good job with his performance in the film as Sonny Corleone, The same can be said with Robert Duvall's performance as Tom Hagen but out of all the casts Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and Diane Keaton are the best in the film. Their performances are the true main highlight of the film and I love Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone the father of Michael, Connie and Fredo Corleone, Diane Keaton's performance was also outstanding in one of her earlier films as Kay Adams Corleone Michael's wife and first love but Al Pacino is by far the best in the film his performance as Michael Corleone was believable and likable at the same time this is by far his best film to date next to Scarface and his performance in this film is unstoppable and deserves an Academy Award at the same time. Director Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job with his work on this film and I seriously love the way he made this film and I can't wait to watch the next two Godfather films he made as well and this is also the only best film he ever made because he managed to turn Mario Puzo's novel into a stunning masterpiece. Overall The Godfather is a provoking, compelling and outstanding crime/gangster film that we will never forget this is one of the best films in the history of cinema and it is now my personal favorite film to date. This movie gets a 10.9/10. Francis Ford Coppola you are a legendary filmmaker!",positive
"Brilliant in every way! You don't get gangster films more realistic, gripping and overall fantastic than this intelligent drama. Easily one of Hollywood's finest!",positive

This film bored me so much I only watched as it's somehow the greatest film of all time which makes no sense to me as its boring as the storylines is stupid so there's no point watching his film,negative
An offer I can't refuse. A masterpiece.,positive
"Perfect movie. Perfect adaptation. I read the book and is very different from the movie, but this is how movie adaptations should be. Let the material speak for itself. Cast the best actor you can find for each role even if it doesn't match the book descriptions, even if the actor is not a famous face. Take the essentials of the book, let the secondary characters go away. Make the movie last 3 hours if necessary even if that means less revenue. Don't downplay violence and sex. No book to movie adaptation has reached this level of perfection.",positive
"A captivating story, with many twists and turns, but I don't think it is very conclusive in the end, I felt like this was all a big tease for the second film, we'll see what that has in store... I have some admiration for Coppola for using minimal direction, leaving his actors, and story to play out without the use of fancy angles or edits, unfortunately this leaves with me with little to talk about... the acting is great.",positive
Couldn't understand half of it but what a movie for the other half,positive
The film made an offer I couldn't refuse.,positive
"It took me a little while to warm to this film, admittedly, but once I did, the magnum opus that is ""The Godfather"" really began to stick in my mind as an entirely memorable film. It tells the now legendary story of the Corleone family, a Mafia family in 40's New York City. Vito Corleone is the Don of the Family, managing affairs and making offers he can't refuse, while training his son, Sonny, to take over. Meanwhile, his other son, Michael, has seemingly washed his hands of the business, becoming a decorated war hero. But when Vito is gunned down in the street and lies close to death, Michael declares vengeance and falls into the seedy world of organized crime. The film features an all star cast that includes Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, with every member of the cast pulling significant weight and bringing gravitas and realism to the story. In particular, Brando's scenery chewing performance is completely iconic and a joy to watch. It starts off very strongly, although I must admit that this film does slightly drop off the pace in the middle act before coming home strongly again. It's still brilliant, but it just felt like a tiny bit too much time was spent with Michael in Sicily. It's a very minor complaint, but there you have it. 9/10 for the Godfather. A classic film.",positive
"Personally The Godfather is not my kind of movie. It didn't drag me in and I feel that it is too long. Despite this, I do however think that the directorial effort is excellent along with the acting as well.",negative

One of the best movies I've ever seen,positive
"It would be very normal if someone new to the world of movies would find that the relevance of ""The Godfather"" is still present today. It would be very normal if someone laughed at you if you are a movie fan and you have not heard/seen this movie. And it would be very normal if you have seen The Godfather a billion times but you don't mind watching it a billion and one times. The sheer brilliance of this movie is the fact that it still finds place today, because even with the rise in technology and various other such things, the movie at its centre is about how a mafia family operates. It is a world where anyone can be killed, anyone can be threatened and anyone who was an enemy can become a friend. We learn to make offers that cannot be refused, we learn to keep our friends close but our enemies closer- and we immediately want to be a part of all this. Vito Corleone, exaggerated successfully by Marlon Brando, is worshipped by many as The Godfather. In the opening scene of the movie, we see how he solves problems for many, making them friends in the process. It is his daughter's wedding and no favours can be denied on this day. Vito has three sons- and there are certain flaws in all of them. Fredo is dumb, Sonny loses his temper real fast, and Mike wants no part in the business run by his father. There is also Tom Hagen, who is a reasonable man and is Consigliere to the family. It is almost known to everyone that the best performance in this movie is by Marlon Brando. With cotton in his mouth, a gait which just shows power, and with every sentence seeming like a statement, Brando creates an image of an unforgettable don, who is feared by many, but respected by many more. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is probably the next strongest character. We see at the start of the movie how Michael expresses to Kay that he wants no involvement in his family's business. However, after certain situations which I would prefer not to discuss in detail, we see Michael coming into his own, and we see how someone who is mocked, laughed at, and even bullied to some extent-can take it all in his own hands and do a pretty neat job of it as well. James Caan as Sonny Corleone is effective- we see how having a hot head can get into the way of things. Quite contrary to his character is Tom Hagen, played brilliantly by Robert Duvall. The consigliere to the family, Hagen is always calm and confident about his opinions, and is a trusted adviser to the family. There are many more characters in the movie-getting into all of them would simply result in giving away half of the movie. The movie is about three hours long, but it feels more like two hours. Coppola makes the movie look grand, and you can really see through the eyes of the Corleones, how power can be a weapon for use as well as for one's own destruction. You see dreams being shattered, you see how you cannot trust the people who you have otherwise always trusted. A masterpiece in every way, The Godfather will always find a place in the top ten movie lists, and will be watched and rewatched, but still find relevance even thousands of years from now.",positive

One of the best movies I've ever seen!,positive
"Knowingly ranked and praised as one of the greatest American Cinema films ever made, Francis Ford Coppola turns the American view of the Mafian life into a whole new spin as he glorifies the characters playing the designated Corleone family in an all out war among the other competing mafia families of the post World War II era. Along with acting veterans Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall, Godfather also made tremendous, power-housing A-list actors out of Al Pacino, James Caan and Diane Keaton. 5 stars.",positive

"This is like the Mona Lisa of modern filmâ""a masterpiece from start to finish.

Just thinking about this movie gives me shivers at the thought of how good it is.",positive
"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is widely considered One of the Greatest Films ever made and there's a reason for that. It's because of its stellar screenplay, the beauty with which Coppola was able to capture capture the slow and subtle corruption of Michael Corleone under particular circumstances and the beauty with which Al Pacino personified that with a tour de Force performance. It just doesn't get much better than this. Th Godfather breaks new boundaries and represents the gold standard in film making.",positive
"It is THE Godfather... 'nough said!!! A classic of all classics and deserving as such. Gripping storyline. Excellent dialogue and character development. Portrayed some of the real events in the Mob's history, which intrigues me as I've always been fascinated with the story. Being able to witness the inner-workings of a Mob family, watching the family dynamics, and witnessing some of the infamous meetings and operations of the Mob's history, all make this film one of the greatest of all time. Well directed and exceptionally acted. It's hard to remember at times that it's just a movie and I'm not actually witnessing the events portrayed!",positive
"some go down the river of madness, but not here. Al pacino strongly show a man's journey down the river of success. Seeing him slowly change into a hard boiled mob boss, worse than his father, is superb and by the end you don't see him as an evil man because you watched him grow in strength and character.",positive
One of my most favorite movies of all time. Absolutely one of the best movies out there.,positive
"The Godfather Movie Review Francis Ford Coppola is a mastermind! The creation of this movie sets him as a legend in the industry of movies! This is a fantastic and wonderful movie. Depicting the mafia and the times of the 1940s New York to perfection! The movie centers around the Corleone Family, led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) as they rise and fall from power in a lengthy, dramatic, happy, sad and all it between adventure through the years. The acting is fantastic, the story, the drama all of it. Sure enough, there can be some things that may not be the best. Like, in the movie, there's a scene where someone gets shot and the blood obviously looks fake. But honestly, that doesn't even matter. It's still great. If you have yet to see this movie, you are seriously missing out. It's like, the perfect mafia movie ever. And that's saying something. 10 out of 10! (5 stars) A masterpiece of the ages!",positive
"Let's face it, I wasn't gonna give this a bad rating, Godfather shows the gritty work that a mafia boss has to go through to truely show that he is the king. But it mainly focuses on the relationship between Vito Corleone and his son, Michael (Al Pacino) and how a military man can be changed by the business of his father. Marlon Brando did a job that was so unbelievably unbelievable it was unbelievable. I think this is truely, One of the best films ever made.",positive
"Greatest movie ever made, Simple!!",positive
"""The Godfather"" (1972) Review by: Stephanie Smith Now I'm looking into an R rated movie that has far more appeal towards adults than children, and that of course is Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". Although it may not seem like it, The Godfather is a prime candidate for one of the greatest movies of all time. It has 9.2 out of 10 rating on IMDB based 861,297 ratings and is second on IMDB's Top 250 Greatest Movies of All Time List (voted by users) behind only ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994). It is also ranked the second greatest film in American cinema behind ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) by the American Film Institute. The movie is based off the book of the same name by Mario Puzo which was a best seller. At the time, it was the highest grossing movie ever made and that's saying a lot considering its rated R and nobody under 17 is allowed to see it without a parent or guardian. It won three Oscars that year including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay. It also got nominated for seven other awards and it deserved all of them. The movie starts off with Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) hearing requests for favors from people on the day of his only daughter's wedding. Vito Corleone is the head of a New York Crime family. His youngest son is Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) who attends the wedding in a Marine Corps uniform. Michael however doesn't want to get involved in the crime his family commits and wants his own life. The story revolves around whether Michael can keep that commitment or not, but I won't spoil anything more than that. The characters are very unique and have wonderful personalities. Apart from Vito and Michael, there is Vito's oldest son and the hot headed Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone (played by James Caan); the fat Peter Clemenza (played by Richard S. Castellano) who is a caporegime for the Corleone family; Vito's adopted son Tom Hagen (played by Robert Duvall) who is the family's lawyer and counselor; Michael's non-Italian girlfriend Kay Adams (played by Diane Keaton); Vito's middle son Fredo Corleone (played by John Cazale) who is weak and stupid and clearly not fit to be a future Don; Vito's only daughter Connie Corleone (played by Talia Shire); Salvatore Tessio (played by Abe Vigoda) who is another caporegime for the Corleone family and too many other lovable characters to count, most of which are Italian and all of them put up very wonderful performances. The acting is in fact so amazing, I am almost convinced the story for this movie actually happened in real life and there were hidden cameras to capture everything that happened. Everything about this movie is wonderful and the only flaw with this movie is when Michael and Sollozzo are having a conversation in Italian, but the editors forgot to add English subtitles so unless you speak Italian, you won't be able to understand them. But in every other conversation in the movie, they added subtitles. They didn't even add English subtitles to the remastered Blu-ray release and I have no idea why. Apart from that, this film is an absolute masterpiece and one of my favorite movies of all time behind only the original ""Star Wars"" (1977). Although children would find it boring, if you're into gangster movies, especially well-organized gangster movies, then definitely watch the Godfather. Hell, anyone into movies absolutely needs to watch this film. RATING: 10 out of 10",positive
"Perfectly acted, paced, shot with a interesting story and nice background music that fits just perfectly for this gangster drama. With Coppola at the helm, directs this film beautifully but also direct all the actors perfectly in their roles, Brando and Pacino just to mention a few of them. This film is considered one of the best and one can see why.",positive
"Not the best movie ever, but pretty close",positive
Perfect story of revenge being best served cold. It drops half a star because the book is so incredible.,positive
"Review Date: July 24, 2014. Movie Review #1: The Godfather If I ever get a job offer to write Movie Reviews and get paid for it, it is an offer I can't refuse. This movie is often quotable to those that have seen it and it is no surprise that this film affected pop culture to a certain degree. There was a time where it got a lot of dough and was a hit which in turn became the highest grossing motion picture at a time back in the 1970's when The Godfather succeeded in the box office. Times have changed and this film is no longer the highest grossing motion picture but still to this day, it still remains as a remarkable film. Is there anything that has not been said about The Godfather? Probably not, but that is not going to stop me from sharing my thoughts regarding Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. The Godfather is a tale of a New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son which carries a heavy weight. This film often gets praised for its acting and that's no surprise there. Even though The Godfather ended up as a trilogy, Most of the cast may have left a huge impression in the second Godfather film but the first movie still has terrific acting throughout the entire film. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corelone is very likely and arguably his best role in his film career. Even though the late Marlon Brando was a well-respected actor before and since The Godfather, He was not the only reason that The Godfather is a great film. The casting is a rather interesting one since it contains actors that either have been around for a number of years or actors that are quite new but had a couple roles. James Caan plays a hot-tempered Sonny, Robert Duvall has a great voice of reason in playing Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton plays her supporting role quite fittingly as Kay Adams, and Al Pacino's performance really makes Michael Corleone an intriguing character in the film and that carries on in the later films. The entire performance of every cast member feels natural even if there were a number of takes shot in the movie. Some may say that this movie has some of the greatest acting in the history of cinema, but I think that would be a bit of a stretch to make that claim. The entire cast makes all the characters believable and realistic in their portrayal. The Godfather might not be the most realistic portrayal of the Mafia, but it is certainly the most romanticized Mafia movie. However there are some realistic moments which is the brutality that The Godfather portrays, and Khartoum was the first example of this film's brutality. I also don't think that the brutality is a way of glorifying violence in the film, it is first and foremost a cinematic portrait of the Mafia, and it also serves as a thought provoking character study which carries on in the later films. It may be a romanticized portrait of the Mafia, and it may be a bit realistic in its brutal moments, but it doesn't feel out of place. Considering the film is set in the 1940's with the notion that it is a romaticized portrayal of the Mafia, there's a theme of moral ambiguity that allows the viewer to think and question about the character inside the movie, I find it strange that outside of the movie, it is possible that a viewer (and myself if I may add) finds the moral ambiguity fascinating in The Godfather. It carries on in the story that is told in the film. One of the fitting touches is the music by Nino Rota and it's a bit predictable that it has that Italian sound but it is extremely fitting to the film. Like the film itself, Nino Rota's Film score to The Godfather is highly regarded as one of the greatest film scores in cinema, I can say it's hard not to like. It definitely has the Italian feeling and it compliments the movie perfectly. I should add an interesting additional note that Carmine Coppola (the father of Francis Ford Coppola) did compose some of the additional music I find this kind of interesting considering that the Father and Son relationship between Michael and Vito was intriguely written. If that isn't interesting enough, Francis Ford Coppola put his daughter Sofia in the movie too with a cameo appearance as a baby boy. Some members of the family may have been involved in this movie and even the later Godfather films, but family also plays a theme in The Godfather. Another nice element that gives the film its elegance is Gordon Willis' cinematography. The film is shot well, the movie looks like it is in the 1940's. The cars you will see in the movie were cars made in the 1940's and this movie was only made in 1972 so it wasn't too difficult to find vehicles like that. The design is fitting for this film because of its setting. Overall, The entire movie is shot extremely well. Even though this is an adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel of the same name published in 1969. Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola did write the screenplay, and regardless if the movie faithfully follows the book from the first page to the last, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo are contempt with the changes that are there from Book to Movie. Even though The Godfather is a considered one of the greatest movies ever made. I was very close in rating this film a 10 out of 10, but I noticed a couple hiccups in the film, even though they are small errors they are not influencing me to change my mind that I find The Godfather to be a terrific film, those who saw the movie at face value can unanimously agree that The Godfather is a great film. My philosophy of ""The 10 rating"" is that it is as great as it is ever going to get. They are not perfect because of a rating like that. There could be some mistakes, and some miniscule flaws that can be found but are excused. Even if that were the case, they don't ruin the movie whatsoever. There really is no such thing as a perfect movie. Francis Ford Coppola pulled the strings with the terrific acting, excellent cinematography, fitting music, believable characters, and an intriguing plot. It is not only one of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpieces, it is one of the masterpieces in cinema This film gets my Thumbs Up, it's a 5-star film. My overall rating of The Godfather is a 9.9 out of 10, it is an excellent film.",positive
"The Godfather is my favorite movie of all time. It touches me in every way: ethically, politically, logically, emotionally... it's thrilling and never gets old",positive
"After more than 40 years, this movie still holds up. As brilliant now, as it was the first time I saw it. It's a definitely an epic, and when takes in conjunction with the its' follow up, it's part of cinematic history. I don't know if there is more to say than hasn't been said already.",positive
This movie was unbelievably great. That voice of Marlon Brando !!!!!,positive
"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. The Godfather is widely considered the greatest movie of all time. Alongside the impeccable performances by legends such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Diane Keaton, the portrayal of the Mario Puzo's book was astonishing. The story takes place early 50's where Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) takes role of not only the leader of the Corleone Family but a Godfather to many people. After a long time his son Michael Corleone came back after serving his country. But after an attack on Don Vito Corleone, Michael must take the place of the new Don of the Corleone Family. Of course not forgetting the famous lines from the 1969 Novel, the dialogue and screenplay are unforgettable. ""I am going to make him an offer he cannot refuse"". Who will ever forget the line Marlon Brando blasted in Film History. No doubt this movie won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay. This movie deserves a 10/10, it's worth every penny, every dollar you spend on it. It's worth watching over and over again.",positive
"Considered to be one of best films ever made, The Godfather is a powerful and thought-provoking crime-drama. Directed and co-written by Francis Ford Coppola, the film follows the Corleone crime family as they're drawn into a mob war with the other New York families over the drug trade. The characters are extraordinarily compelling; do in no small part to the outstanding performances of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Talia Shire. However, it's Brando's performance as Vito Corleone that steals the film and immortalizes the character of the Godfather. Additionally, the craftsmanship is exceptional, from the score, to the cinematography, to the costumes and set designs, the look and feel of the film is remarkably vivid and emotionally evocative. Dealing with heavy dramatic themes, The Godfather is a cinematic classic that continues to resonate with audiences.",positive

A classic Hollywood mafia film,positive
"Perfect movie, but are the bloody deaths so necessary?",positive
"Been meaning to see this forever but have avoided it thus far because: A. I don't much like gangster movies, and B. Its reputation is so overinflated that it seemed bound to disappoint. This film defined the modern Mafia drama so every famous scene in here has been reproduced, parodied, and imitated countless times since then. Even the lines that were new and fresh at the time (""make him an offer he can't refuse"", ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli"", or even ""what can I do for you on this, the day of my daughter's wedding"") have been so publicized that everyone knows them. But there's a reason the film has the reputation it does. It combines some truly incredible performances with a tragic arc which focuses so tightly on the family that it can occasionally be hard to keep track of the big picture. I've never been a huge Pacino fan but here he shows that he can actually act without veering between the extremes of hamming it up ridiculously and seeming half asleep. Brando is often billed as the big star of the piece but to my mind it's Pacino, in what is clearly the lead role, who steals the show. His transition from a man who, while not exactly estranged from his family, isn't a big fan of their behavior or methods, to the leader of the crime syndicate is well constructed and emphasizes the corruption that comes from such power. As Michael becomes less sympathetic his story becomes more compelling. Subsequent mob films tend to avoid the broad epic scale of these movies in favor of more intimate views, which means that in some ways this film still feels fresh. Even in those areas where mob dramas are simply continuing themes established in these films the Godfather often does it better despite being the first. And the way that the film is shot, edited, and arranged is dmn near perfect.",positive
"Visually Stunning movie, a must for action movie seekers.",positive
About an hour too long. I did like the horse head in the bed though :-),negative
"The greatest movie EVER. The acting is the best I've seen. The dialogue is spot on. The quotes are awesome. The action is great. The running time, a little too long.",positive
"Realer than life itself. Bigger than life. Explodes with realism. Hits every emotion and works in every aspect. The benchmark of film. Anything that is considered a great movie, probably took some pointers from the Godfather. The Godfather is The Beatles of film history. In fact its so good, that it will take you hours to be able to explain how good it was to yourself. Its a masterpiece that cant even be compared to anything in the world. The Godfather is FILM.",positive

"If someone says ""I dislike The Godfather"", I don't trust that person.",positive
cinema is incomplete without Brando and his husky Italian lines... and the rating of this movie is in conjuction with its sequels. They weave characters so ominus and tangible that they create the gods of cinema. it's not that you're overcome by how moving the tale is or that the acting is top notch... it's the fact that the story line creeps up on you and all of the sudden you realize what you're watching - a masterpiece of film.,positive

Coppola's regal, revolutionary film is the golden crown of its genre, jewelled with powerhouse performances, imagery, themes and iconography, all of which never cease to inspire those seduced by its charm, whether they be the next Martin Scorsese, or just the average cinema-goer. Game-changing cinema, oozing majesty from start to finish.",positive
"Is this a great film and a powerful story of crime and family? Absolutely. Does it deserve its reputation as the best movie of all time? Absolutely not. Don't get me wrong - this is, indeed, a fantastic film. The acting is great, the script is great, and the cinematography and music are beautiful. But honestly, there are simply a lot of movies that are more powerful and complex than this one. I've seen many, many films that moved me emotionally far more than The Godfather did, and had more interesting stories and characters. This film has two flaws that, to me, kept it from being a complete masterpiece. First, the length. It's simply too long and has too many scenes with no significance of any kind. It's almost a full 30 minutes before anything interesting happens. If they had simply trimmed the fat from this movie, it would have been much better. The second flaw is....(getting ready for the hate comments)...Brando. I'm sorry, but how can anyone take him seriously? He talks and acts like a gangster from a Bugs Bunny cartoon. It's one of the most over-acted performances I've ever seen (that's supposed to be serious). He's ridiculous. And on top of that, I couldn't understand half of what he was saying. Again, let me emphasize that this IS a great film. Almost everything about is is done beautifully, and everyone who loves movies should watch it at some point. But I feel that is reputation comes from the impact it had when it was made, rather than how it holds up now. It was probably much more impressive in 1972.",positive
'The Godfather' offers unbelievable performances from an all star cast as well as gives the viewer a beautifully depicted film that is groundbreaking and nothing short of a masterpiece in cinema.,positive

"The Godfather is often labeled as the greatest film of all time and boy does it live up to that name. The Godfather is a landmark in motion picture history and is a cinematic masterpiece. There is nothing weak about this film, everything about it is powerful. The script is sound and the film is full of complex characters. Marlon Brando (Don Vito Carleone) is the perfect leader of the family and a very intimidating figure, Al Pacino (Michael Corleone) plays the youngest son of Don Vito and it is one of his greatest acting performances, how he goes from a timid young man into a strong, hardy, important figure in the family in such a short time makes his character very likable. The film is full of family orientated characters and how they struggle for power. The most powerful weapon in the mob world is intimidation and The Godfather is full of intimidating characters, that is how the leaders earn their respect. The storyline is beautifully written, it brings us deep into the lives of a mob family and reveals a lot about their culture. The plot isn't predictable and because of this it creates an intense atmosphere. A lot of praise must be given to writer/director Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo. The Godfather is captivating throughout, it truly is a work of art. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?",positive
This movie is one that you can not refuse..,positive
"The Godfather (1972) was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who in 1970 directed the successful movie Patton. Although the Patton movie was successful, not even Coppola could have predicted the success that was produced by The Godfather. The movie was based on a novel by Mario Puzo, who along with Coppola wrote the screenplay. The lead role was played by Marlon Brando, and he was supported by great actors, such as Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert Duvall, and many others who put in amazon performances. The first scene sets the stage for the rest of the movie, and gives the viewer an early insight as to what to expect through the movie. It starts off in a dark room where the face of an old friend of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the old friend was begging Don Vito to help him deliver justice to the two men who had beaten his daughter. Don Vito Corleone was offended that his old friend had gone to the police for help before coming to him. However, when his friend explains he was scared to because he desired to live an honest life in America, but when a judge gives the two men suspended sentences, he knows the only way to punish these men was to go to Don Vito Corleone. It is apparent from the beginning that Don Vito Corleone is a dangerous man, but he is also shown as a compassionate man, when he agrees to help his old friend, but tells him he may one day ask for a favor in return for his help. The favor he asks from his old friend is one that will shock the audience! That same day, the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter was going on, and after the meeting with his friend, he went out for a family picture. Another soft side of the godfather is revealed as he puts off the family picture until his son Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Michael shows up dressed in a military uniform and is the only member of the family not involved in the family crime business. An exciting sequence of events changes that, however. This movie from start to finish is full of excitement and surprises, and it starts when Don Vito Corleone once again shows he has morals and refuses to involve his family in the drug trade. Not all the New York families process these morals, and the bloody feud ensues, which leaves the viewer on the edge of his or her seat anticipating what is going to happen next. This movie is not for the faint hearted, but it shows both sides of a crime family, from the love they share for their children, wife's, and other family members, to the murderous rages, which can be triggered at any moment. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino put in stunning performances' which is supported from the excellent supporting actors.' With 32 awards, which include three Academy Awards, and 19 nominations for awards, it would not be an exaggeration to say The God Father is one of the best movies of all time. For anyone who has not yet watched this movie, it will provide 175 minutes of ultimate excitement, and leave him or her eager to watch The Godfather II.",positive
Great but editing style wise it's dated.,positive
"The Godfather is a film that will probably either bore you or be a breath of fresh air for you. There's not much of a middle ground. For me, the latter happened. This film takes such a deep look into the human condition that we normally only see in novels, and it turns a scene as violent as mob life into a work of art. It has a pace slower than most films in order to grasp these elements that make it so beautiful, and for that reason some may find it boring. Nevertheless, it is worth a watch in order for you to find out which category you fall into.",positive
"There is absolutely no other film like this, this movie is in every way filmmaking at it's best, the script/dialogue, the characters, the art direction, the acting, the cinematography, the fashion designs, the action, this is an unbelievable film and one of my absolute favorites.",positive
"A sensational movie, full of powerful performances and memorable moments.",positive
"The greatest gangster crime movie possibly ever made. The movie has been regarded as an all time great. Going in if I knew nothing of the hype I would consider it a masterpeice. Each character displays their roles so well you believe these people are who they are. From Robert Duvalls masterful business like persona, to Vitos brilliant leadership demeanor, to Michaels wonderful transition from war hero to family boss, this movie all around is beautiful. It's 3 hour run time is long ideed but the direction is flawless, and the editing is perfect as a perfect amount of time is spent on each important scene and never stretched too long. The movie just flows well together. While the story is great, the director and the actors are the real geniuses here, as they play their part to absolute perfection.",positive
This film is great however very long and boring. Too much talking. Still great.,positive
"Classic. Wonderful film, and great start to a spectacular trilogy.",positive
There's nothing I can say,positive
"I've always wanted to know why people thought this was the greatest movie of all time, now I can see why. The Story is brilliantly written, well Acted, well shot, and great music. I wouldn't say this is my #1 favorite movie but it is now up there in my favorites. A+++",positive
"Good film, very long but very clever and action packed",positive
Sonny is my favorite character.,positive
I'm never bored watch this film over and over again (around 3 times maybe). i don't think this movie needs sequel or prequel or whatever. I like that Don Vito dies in his tomato garden while playing with his grandchild. So Italy and beautifully!,positive
"Requires a lot of listening, and a few viewings; but all in all, it is as great as you've heard.",positive
"Powerful, emotive, immortal story about a family covered with blood. Stunning performances and brilliant direction. A complete masterpiece.",positive
Greatest movie ever made.,positive
"Oh my god. Often proclaimed as one of the greatest films of all time, The Godfather definitely exceeded expectations. With its unexpected events, and a strong cast, Its of no wonder this film reaches a new high in the film world, I sure as hell can't wait to see the next one!",positive
I'm not going to try and insult audiences who have loved this film for over 40 years by telling you this is a bad film - it was just never meant for me. I personally found it to be one of the most intensely boring films I have seen in a while. I suppose it's the genre I have a problem with: crime and gangster films seldom interest me. This one is no different.,negative
"Its hard to think of many films in this day and age that can match the bar setting behemoth that is the Godfather. The fact that over forty years have went by and it still destroys many films that cross its path lays testiment to the work of Coppola and an astounding cast. Don Vito Corleone, a blistering performance by Brando, is the head of a massive italian/american mafia, one of 5 families operating within the new york area. After his daughters wedding he is gunned down and one of his close associates is murdered by a rival family, with Don vito left fighting for his life, his empire is handed over to his son, Sonny, Caan, who goes on a self destructing path of revenge. This act drags brothers, Fredo, Cazale, Michael, Pacino and orphaned brother Tom, Duvall, into a dangerous game of revenge and destruction. Eventually leaving Michael to pick up the pieces and raise the Corleone status to its once Exceedingly high reputation. Its hard to find any fault with this film what so ever. The acting is just phenomenal,everyone is cast perfectly and allowed time to mature as characters, the ensmeble pull off so much belieability as a close knit family its a joy to watch. The writing helps this futher by being volumptous and full of extremely well crafted dialogue. All the actors really need to do is read the lines and were onto a winner here. The cinematography is just astounding, gorgeous lighting, entrancing tracking shots, engrossing pacing, that can see such a large volume of themes and story telling that even with its almost 3 hours running time it still struggles to fit everything in comfortably. This film is huge, in every sense of the word, there is so much going on that some viewers may need a second watch through to chew down on all the material but its worth the effort. The Godfather is one of cinemas rare masterpieces that not only influenced decades of film making, but it also helped bounce some extraordinary talent to a stratospheric level. An absolute must watch by everyone",positive
Greatest movie from the greatest decade of movies.,positive
"Despite being widely recognized as one of the greatest films ever, I didn't like it. That's all I have to say, it just didn't connect with me.",negative
"Rating: 10/10 Sometimes you just have to be in the right mindset to appreciate something. The first time I tried watching The Godfather, it was a commercially interrupted television broadcast and I only sat through about a third of the film (which is three hours without commercials so you can imagine how long it'd be with them). That was obviously the wrong way to watch it. The second time I was just not in the right mood to appreciate it. I watched it all the way through, but with little mind to actually pay attention to the story as a whole. I found myself bored with it and ready to write it off as an overrated movie, undeserving of its status. However, I have always been a firm believer that with almost any film, particularly if it is considered great, it is irresponsible to not watch the movie at least twice and to give it your full attention. I finally did so, and I can admit that my initial full viewing experience was rather poor on my part. The Godfather is fully deserving of the status it enjoys. Do I personally consider it the greatest film of all time? Perhaps not, but I can no longer begrudge any who deem it so. It is a masterpiece of the highest order. A brushstroke on the canvas of American cinema, and without that stroke the portrait would be almost entirely different. Simply put, it is every bit as great as anyone has ever said that it was or is.",positive
"Kelly and I watched the Godfather last night. She had never seen it! It was probably the 5th time I have seen it and it was just as compelling as the last time I saw it. I learn something new every time I see it. Has there ever been another performance like Brando's, where every gesture and word uttered has you on the edge of your seat? The film and it's brilliant juxtaposition of the celebration of life and brutal violence can be seen in so many other films and shows to this day...",positive
"Sprawling, yet intimate. This is what a classic looks like. Still holds up year after year.",positive
"A timeless classic of power, family, loyalty and crime. Coppola masterpiece deliver us a unique familiar drama set after the WWII with amazing performances and a tragic character development.",positive
Watching this film was an offer I could not refuse.,positive
"The story and characters are written like something out of a Shakespearean tragedy, the actors are perfect in their roles and the film has that 40s vibe and great cinematography. The Godfather is not the crime film you expect to see, it goes beyond exceeding your expectations.",positive
Words cannot describe how good the Godfather is,positive
An elegant crime masterpiece flowing rich with colour and life. Everything from the plot to the characters are intriguing and suspenseful truly leaving an impact in cinema history.,positive
Classic! What more I can say?,positive
"Considered one of the great movies ever made for a reason. Well acted by all of it's cast, specifically Brando and Pacino, well written, and very well directed. There is no stone left unturned in this movie, and every move the story makes has a reason. It is intense, memorable, and aside from a few technical issues (dubbing), it never loses your attention. Worth the long three hour ride for sure. 9.75/10",positive
"Masterfully crafted. Only reason Marlon Brando won that Oscar, though, is because he's Marlon Brando. He does a good job, but the real standout here is the story.",positive
"Just because the camera and the narrative doesn't move around in an impressing style, like its sequel, does not make the first ""Godfather"" weaker--with Brando in a career highlight, this monster of a movie is riveting and the highlight of the series.",positive
one of the best films,positive
It cannot be define in one masterpiece.,positive
"Fascinating film in which criminals are the protagonists, and that the audience are made to care about what happens to them.",positive
"Gosh it's long and long winded but finally I deployed the patience and stamina needed to concentrate on this 3 hour epic, it still took two sittings but what riches....pure art",positive
"Recently watched it on the big screen at the BFI, this film is poetry!",positive
"If you want to see an EPIC movie, this is it! Marlon Freakin' Brando you're a beast!!! Now that is acting people! Easily a 5/5 or 10/10. Just Brando's performance is enough to make this an instant classic but everyone's acting was great. The story unfolds nicely and the character development is very well executed. WOW! I have not yet seen part 2 yet but I will soon...and to think, some people say part 2 is even better! You have to see this movie, it won't disappoint.",positive
It couldn't be better,positive
One of the greatest films ever,positive
"I watched this movie a few weeks ago because my friend kept nagging me to watch it saying that ""It's one of the best movies ever"" and ""It's my favorite movie"". So I watched it. I knew it was gonna be good, but didn't necessarily think it was for me. When I finished it, I was blown away. I can easily say that this is my favorite movie ever. I haven't seen Citizen Kane which a lot of people debate about if The Godfather is better, so I don't know if it's THE best movie ever, just my favorite. Now let's get to the movie. This movie is about the Corleone Crime Family (or the Corleone Family) and the things and people they deal with. The movie has a boatload of great actors and I'll only name a few, like Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I can't think of anyone in this movie who acted poorly because no one did. The way I explained the story is really bad because there are so many other things going on like the pressure of joining the narcotics business and Don Vito Corleone trying to pass on the family business to his son, Michael. Another thing I like about this movie I that it's a movie where you can name thousands of scenes and for almost every one you can say that it was an amazing scene. My favorite scene is when Michael is in the restaurant (SPOILER ALERT ahead!! Skip to the next sentence to not be spoiled!) and he shoots Captain McCluskey and Sollozzo. A lot of people say that the best scene is the baptism scene but I like this one because that is the one moment when you realize that Michael is now fully into the family business and there's no going back. The only problem I have with the movie is that the pacing is really weird. You'll have one scene last for like 7-10 minutes and the next one be like 30 seconds to 1 minute long, but that's not really a problem because you won't even notice it until you watch it more an more. All in all, this movie is perfect other than the pacing. Great acting, beautiful story and memorable scenes makes for a movie that is easily a 5/5. Now I understand why my friend kept nagging me...",positive
"Certainly a landmark, but a bit overrated in my opinion.",positive
"Perfect in every sense of the word. Coppola has managed to lift the words from Mario Puzo's eponymous novel and construct them into this epic, influential masterpiece.",positive
No words need be said.,positive
Still one of the best films ever made. Powerful and beautiful.,positive
"The Godfather Review by FUTURE TV (Al Carlson) The Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama. The Godfather revolves around the Corleone's, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone's is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn't want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo's, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo's drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle. The characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don's oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It's fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically. Directer Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola's first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. This film should be immediately followed up by it's sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They're both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won't be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven't seen this movie yet, it's about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can't refuse.",positive
(shouts from the rooftops) THIS MOVIE IS A FLAWLESS MASTERPIECE!!,positive
"The plot's a bit thick, but a talented cast and witty dialogue make The Godfather a gangster classic.",positive
good plot and beautiful story,positive
"One of cinema's greatest achievements in film history. The Godfather is an excellent adaptation of Mario Puzo's classic novel with Ford Coppola's smooth direction, legendary performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, it's memorable score and some great quotable lines. Everything about The Godfather works",positive
"If you have the patience, this is perhaps one of the most rewarding viewing experiences, but it's hard to imagine this ever being made today due to it's assured pace and underplayed acting",positive
The best 3 hours of your life,positive
Duh!!! The best movie ever made!!,positive
It insists upon itself.,negative
The Best Movie Ever!!!!!,positive
If you haven't seen this yet your an asshole and your parents failed you.,positive
"I've only seen a few movies back in the 90's but this is by far, the best one I've watched. I was convinced to watch it after seeing high reviews about it, others even claim it is the ""best film ever"".I even saw a special episode about it on History once and I forbid myself to watch it because I haven't seen the movie yet. And so I decided to watch it after all, which was one of the greatest decisions I've mad--ever!. I also insisted my siblings and dad to watch it with me. Honestly, the first few minutes of the movie isn't much of a thrill but as the story progresses I could unconsciously feel my jaw dropping. I especially like Marlon Brando's acting, and his voice..just wow. I also became fond of Al Pacino's acting, and how his character progresses at the end. And his look at the end, where his men closes the door and Kay just had this curious look (One of the best scenes ever!) I am now continuing the trilogy (I am at the last part) and too bad, Marlon had to die in the first movie, I really really appreciated his acting. The Godfather really is a classic and a true masterpiece. <3",positive
Without doubt this is one of the best films ever made. Total perfection and so real it takes me back to the old Brooklyn neighborhood in the 40's and 50's.,positive
One of the greatest films ever made,positive
The Best Gangster Movie.,positive
"An intense, shocking, and groundbreaking film on all fronts, The Godfather is a deep and fascinating crime drama with surprisingly sympathetic characters and an amazingly realistic screenplay.",positive
"This movie blows. Nah you kidding? This is the best movie of all time! 100% 5 out of 5. A+. If you don't like this film, chances are nobody likes you, and I'm sorry for that. I mean that's just the way it is, nobody likes you. By all means be yourself, don't let society change you but just remember, you're an idiot.",negative
Don't trust anyone telling you this movie is overrated. It isn't!,positive
i loved it..obviously one of the best movies ever made...a must see.,positive
"I mean, does it really need a review? It's just perfect.",positive
Watched this again. What a movie. Now for The Godfather II.,positive
A timeless masterpiece something like this will never come round again.,positive
Watched it again! And still love it!,positive
A film full to the brim with character and quality.,positive
"A defining film in the history of cinema , The Godfather is a timeless masterpiece ! every scene is flawless , simply Gold!! Al Pacino is at his best here and Marlon Brando gives a powerhouse performance as Vito Corleone ! must watch!!",positive
Nunca me cansaré de verla.,positive
The greatest film ever put on screen. This classic really has no chance of falling from the throne of movies for at least another century. A instant timeless Classic!,positive
"Just about a close to perfect as a movie gets. Universally praised by critics and movie-goers alike. Does it get any better than The Godfather... actually yes, in a surprising turn of events the original ""Bigger and Better Sequel"" manages to top even this with The Godfather Part II and it does it all even without Marlon Brando.",positive
"A classic and one of the best films of all times, if not the best!",positive
The greatest movie ever made,positive
Brando carries the whole weight of such a heavy film on his broad shoulders with his mafioso swagger and captivating onscreen personality. Greater film by the greater film-maker. Hats Off to Coppola!,positive
probably the most iconic and amazing films of all time. francis ford coppola at his best and also the legend himself marlon brando!!,positive
Masterful every time.,positive
"I have FINALLY seen it. And the film is extremely good!! Yes!!! I was worried that I wouldn't like it but I was terribly wrong. The film does a considerably better job than Goodfellas at immersing the audience into the true mafia lifestyle. The stylistic choices were brilliant, and the themes and symbolism were rivetingly appropriate. Though the pacing could've quickened in some areas, the pace was still thorough and meticulous. Exploring in-depth themes of deception and internal struggle. I can't wait to see the sequel!",positive
"Compelling with exquisite acting, however I feel for the near 3 hour runtime that it is just missing that little something.",negative
"Not going to waste my time on a review. If you watched it and didn't like it, you either lack intelligence or are a 5 year old girl.",positive
"In my opinion, one of the best movies ever made, if not the best. You can't get better than The Godfather, that's just straight up fact.",positive
Arguably the greatest films in history.,positive
"A true classic - so sad about Sonny 'Santino' who should have been the boss! Keep an eye out for the oranges that feature in this and the 2 sequels. Interesting to read the book, which talks a little more about Sonny's affair with a girl and his illegitimate son. Sonny is spoken of in colourful language about the size of his man-hood and more. You must see this film!",positive
"Probably one of the finest movies I've had a privilege to watch. ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli.""",positive
One of the best movies of all time,positive
The crowning achievement in cinematic history. The one by which all others are measured.,positive
"""The Godfather"" is honestly a terrible film. After reading the book I grew to dislike this film even more. The book is one of the best novels that I have ever read, and the movie butchers everything cool about the novel. The book is intense, suspenseful, and entertaining. The movie isn't. It ruins death scenes, puts less focus on cool characters, (Johnny Fontane, Al Neri), and is incredibly slow and boring. There are many other crime films much better than this one. Martin Scorsese alone has made three crime films, (Goodfellas, The Departed, Casino), that are much, much better than this film. If you haven't seen this movie, don't. Read the book and you will be entertained. Watch the movie and you will fall asleep.",negative
The best mafia movie in my opinion.,positive
best movie of all time !,positive
"The Godfather is one of those movies like Citizen Kane, and Casablanca that has reached legendary status. And the Godfather absolutely deserves it. It is composed of a beautiful symphony of impeccable acting and seamless storytelling. Although the film is long and paced slow, it doesn't matter because of how enthralling the story is. 5/5 An absolute masterpiece",positive
The greatest gangster movie ever made,positive
What a piece of work this is! Everything here is done perfectly.,positive
"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said already. Truly a masterpiece and arguably the best movie ever made. If you have not watch it, turn off your computer, run to the nearest Blockbuster- never mind. Turn your computer back on and watch it on Amazon.",positive
The Godfather is one of the greatest films of all time! It is a must see for all film buffs and really anyone at all!,positive
"The Godfather is an epic crime film, that dominates early cinema, with a great cast, and witty dialogue, The Godfather is the best gangster film of the 70's.",positive
"A masterpiece, the stable of gangster movies, and an all time favorite. This movie was slow and boring at times, but that didn't matter. I was sucked into the movie like teens and reality shows.",positive
"Its a film classic no doubt, And re invented the crime genera - 9.7/10",positive
It's the Godfather. It's perfect. What more needs to be said?,positive
What can I say ? Terrific performances. A classic.,positive
"A transcending classic, The Godfather is violent when necessary, but simultaneously elegant. It's beautifully shot, powerfully acted, the score is flamboyant, you sympathize, relate with, and see where its admittedly criminal characters are coming from, and its depiction of the mafia is nearly spot-on. It's a milestone of film making quality that, to this day, has made the test of time ""sleep with the fishes"". The Godfather is an organized crime epic touching on loyalty, family, trust, and deceit with genuine character/story arcs and a superb script.",positive
"Note: Full rewrite happening sometime (very behind at the time). ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse."" The 2nd best film and the best book adaptation I've ever seen. Also, it's undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made. Based off Mario Puzo's book of the same name, The Godfather follows the Corleone crime family doing their business during 1945 to 1955, where certain events come up, damaging the family. Francis Ford Coppola does an amazing job directing as he knows when and how to depict the scenes, and the script he co-wrote alongside author Mario Puzo is extremely smart, filled with tragic scenes, and loaded with quotable, smart, and articulate dialogue. The film also shows horrific crimes, characterization, the effect the film's events has on the characters, and stellar acting, especially from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan. The Godfather also has an amazing score by Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola (additional music) that, unlike most film scores, is not loud and pumping with tension, instead opting for a more soft, dramatic tone that clearly explains the events in the film. The film's incredibly long length of 2 hours, 55 minutes showcase massive complexion that is actually easy to follow. Unlike most crime films today, The Godfather doesn't need action to keep audiences on their seats, thanks to the quality present in the film. Amazing cinematography help play out the scenes with much detail and appeal for viewers. Coppola nails everything, including answering questions, staying away from clichÃÃ, (C)s, doing the best he can to appease his audience, and keeping everything even, especially the pace (the addition of action would've ruined this film 100%), which allows us to see how everything is playing out. The film sets the stage for mob films thanks to grit, graphic violence, and keeping crime the main subject. The most important thing that makes this film a masterpiece is the style that filmmakers can't seem to nail to this day, and might not happen for a long time, or at all. A must-see for film fanatics, and those who want to see something different from other films.",positive
One of my favorite movies,positive
"Let's face it, the greatest movie of all time; I'll leave it at that.",positive
One of the greatest movies ever made. The Godfather still is as moving and influential as it was back in 1972. There is not one scene that is out of place or boring. One I would highly recommend.,positive
"It's a classic, what can I say?",positive
"There have been great movies, there have been amazing movies, but The Godfather may just be the only movie that can truly be ""perfect""",positive
the greatest movie ever.,positive
This film is a must see for everyone who likes films I cannot say other thing,positive
"The biggest movie of the 70s and quite possibly of all time, The Godfather is an eternal standing landmark in cinema. Some of the best screenwriting ever, an excellent cast full of amazing performances (Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan), it's great attention to detail of the 40s-50s style Mafia and The Godfather himself, Marlon Brando, help this movie live forever for many generations to see",positive
"Has its moments, but I found it a bit over hyped. Did enjoy the sequel much more.",negative
The only problem I have with this movie is Michael is in Italy way to long. Most say it's the greatest Mob movie ever made. I disagree. In my opinion Goodfellas is at the top followed by the Godfather.,positive
"A dark, compelling, fascinating tale of a crime family. The Godfather excels in character development, cinematography, and style, and lives up to its critical acclaim.",positive
"Regarded as one of the most important and influential films of the century. This film has definitely changed the way gangster films are created. Back in the golden days of cinema, gangster films were notable for their violence and profanity. The Godfather changed the way contemporary gangster or crime films are approached. I don't want the review of this film be based on the film's impact but rather focusing on the film on its own. The film's story is based on a novel by Mario Puzo and written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola. Puzo's novel has been, before the film, has been a commercial and critical hit. I have not read Puzo's novel but Coppola's writing for this film is definitely entertaining. The film may have metaphors and deep layered themes but to me, it wasn't something I was looking for, as the story of this family is so damn entertaining that it did not need to be layered to be interesting. The strongest areas of this film focuses on the structure and functioning of the family business. The film also depicts the rise of Michael Corleone and how different he becomes when he becomes involved in the business he never wanted to be in the first place. Francis Ford Coppola has created the most acclaimed films of all time and all seem to be confined in the decade of the 70's. Each one of those films, aside from the Godfather sequel, is completely different from one another and at least one will appeal to a person. Coppola focused a lot on the culture and family aspect of this film which made this something unique. Though different from previous gangster films, it did not sacrifice on the areas that makes it exciting like the violence and tension. It still focuses on the competing families and the betrayal that is familiar in the genre. Brilliant direction has allowed every scene to be important in driving the story, there is no scene that does not drive anything for either the characters or the plot. Gordon Willis' cinematography feels like a picture or a video from an old camera that has aged. The film is dominated by a golden hue that gives the film that feeling of age.The film successfully feels like a period film and immerses you in the time period of the 1940's. Scenes like the wedding and the baptism are breathtaking. Willis has added in the film's lasting power as there are very few films that captures a moment in time so well as what he did for The Godfather and it's sequel. The film may feel slow to some people but I feel that it's important as it allows for characters to develop and the story to have more breathing room. The film is driven in detailed and intricate performances rather than spectacular and grand moments. How many of you have watched this film or at the very least heard the theme and gets stuck on your head for hours after you've heard it. As I am writing this, it's playing in my head. The score is something that would be heard in funerals or some other sad dramatic moment. The score is stays faithful to the film's cultural roots and at the same time making it something that sounds from a classic gangster films. Due to the film's score being so memorable and effective, it has become something composers of films in the same genre to go back to, in creating their scores. Iconic role played by an iconic actor. Vito Corleone can never be pictured played by another actor aside from Marlon Brando. The actor has played characters that are typical from leading actors and so seeing him in a character that was definitely at least 10 to 15 years older than his own during production, was a revelation. He embodied this respected and vulnerable man, and without a doubt outshone every actor in this film. Pacino was great as Michael but I felt he shows more of his acting capabilities in the second and third film. The entire cast works well together and each performance can be labelled as their most strongest in their career. This is one of the best films from Coppola. I cannot say this is his magnum opus because other films he has written and directed, Apocalypse Now and The Godfather Part II, are equally as powerful. The Godfather is an example of an amazing story, brilliantly acted and excellent direction in adapting an already iconic novel.",positive
Simply one of. The two best movies ever made .the other one being The Godfather II,positive
"My favorite gangster movie ever made. The acting is some of the best acting I've ever seen, Brando by far is one of Cinema's best actors. It's such an entertaining movie, I didn't find it boring in the slightest. The filmmaking and dialogue is outstanding and they did such an amazing job at doing a period piece. Brando shouldn't be the only one recognized for their amazing performance. All of the acting was incredible. This movie is just so incredible, there's nothing I don't like about it. It's one of cinema's best, despite it's year I still think it's good. If you're a movie fan and you have not seen this movie than I'm going to find it very hard to trust you.",positive

"Taas yksi aukko sivistyksessä paikattu, yksi katsomatta jäänyt leffa vähemmän IMDB top 250-listalta (tämä on siellä peräti kakkosena). Vähän vaikea siis pisteyttää tällaista klassikkoa, mutta leffan pituus, vanhahtava kerronta sekä itselle hieman vieras genre tiputtivat tähtiä. Kolme tuntia on leffalle aivan liikaa, olipa kuinka hyvä tahansa. Mutta hienohan tämä oli, hienosti ohjattu ja kuvattu, pituudesta huolimatta uni ei yllättänyt, ja lopussa ymmärsin juonikokonaisuudenkin. Pitänee kerätä voimia, että jaksaa katsoa ne kaksi jatko-osaakin...",negative

"If you're looking for the crowning achievement in all of cinema (and I'm hoping those that haven't seen this is a small, small minority), The Godfather would be it. Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction combined with Mario Puzo's riveting story, Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola's stirring and memorable score, Gordon Willis's breathtaking cinematography, the universally spectacular performances, what more needs to be said, people?! Even with a running time that's just shy of three hours, the story, narrative and richly written characters have you so captivated, you don't even feel the length of time go by. This is the film that forever shaped my taste in movies, and no matter how many times I watch it, I always find a new, hidden gem revealed to me.

Incredibly acted with a plot flowing with grace.,positive
Greatest movie of all time.,positive
"An absolute epic masterpiece. Even though it is 3 hours in length, I maintained interest during every second of it, a feat few films at 90 minutes can accomplish.",positive
Settle back and get ready for an in-depth look at Europeans in America and what they used to do. The acting of the greats Marlon and Al bring this film to a standard that was unique in its time and remains so. Cinematography follows the story with stylish intimacy creating intrigue and brutality with some excellent camera work. The tension is very palpable. Nibbles: Pesto pasta.,positive
"I tend to say this is my favorite movie because it's very politic and mostly true.

"There is so much to love about this movie, I don't even know where to start. I'll begin by saying that Brando is the best, my favourite actor, and his performance as Don Corleone is nothing short of perfect. There are no flaws, and I would go so far as to say that about the entire film. James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino are excellent..Caan in particular as loose cannon Sonny Corleone. I like the sequels, loved GoodFellas, Bugsy, The Untouchables, but this stands alone as the definitive mafia movie. It is sort of the brass ring, an example of what dramatic cinema should aspire to be.",positive
one of my favourite films. only had to watch it once to come to that conclusion,positive
"The Godfather, the most known, most respected gangster film of all time, with Marlon Brando starring as Don Vito Corleone, and with an unforgettable performance, he will never be forgotten. Al Pacino stars as Vito Corleone's youngest son Michael, James Caan stars as Santino 'Sonny; Corleone and Robert Duvall stars as adopted son Tom Hagen. This is a Film with powerful performances from all the cast. [Caution, SPOILERS ARE AHEAD] The film begins with the marriage of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, as his daughter is marrying; the Don hears requests as his role of the Godfather, after all, 'No Sicilian can ever refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.' After meeting and refusing an offer made by Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo,The Turk sees that Sonny Corleone might be more acceptive to the trade, so his affiliates, The Tattaglia family, try to assassinate The Don, (Sonny Corleone was the Underboss, if the Don dies, Sonny would replace him.) This shocking turn of events change the film and also change the characters, from Michael assassinating 'The Turk' to the brutal assassination of Sonny. A truly great film made by the man who would change gangster films for the years to come, his name is Francis Ford Coppola, with terrific performance from every single person who stars in the film, especially from Marlon Brando; he hadn't starred in a hit movie since THE YOUNG LIONS in 1958 (the last time he was nominated for anything), and also a terrific performance from Al Pacino. The film was nominated for 10 categories in The Oscars and won 3 of those nominations for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Marlon Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Mario Puzo and F.F.Coppola. It turns out that Marlon Brando and Al Pacino both refused to accept the award. 1) Is because Marlon Brando's reason is because of his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television and 2) Is because Al Pacino was 'insulted' that he got an award for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR, he felt that he should have gotten the award for BEST ACTOR seeing as he had more 'on-screen time' than Brando (Wow..Just...just...Wow) Seeing as I had never even watched THE GODFATHER before, I had no idea what to expect (I kind of expected some of it seeing as I played the video-game) but other than that, I just didn't know. I kicked back and relaxed as I played the movie that changed films forever, as it rolled in black, that distinct sound of music I heard every single time I played the game was playing for real, I loved how the game captured every detail of the film, from the voices and likeness, to the scenes from the movie, but that feeling of love, that tingling sensation of your hair, the moment I loved most...was the opening credits, the theme song of the godfather, with that brilliant font saying 'Mario Puzo's THE GODFATHER', I couldn't believe that I was actually watching what I saw in the game, that's why I felt a connection between myself and the film. The talent of the actors, the brilliant Choreography, the brilliant song, the extravagant make-up and a brilliant, EXTRA-ordinary film overall, I felt nostalgic seeing that film even though I had never seen it. My final opinion of this film is that it deserves 100% for it, I saw a film that was 2hrs and 55mins long and I did not lost interest throughout it all, whilst I watched it, I even compared it to the game, the Corleone Compound looks so detailed in the game, I kept on thinking, when I play the game from now on, it's going to be my own film that I will make in the game, I'll change that historic movie and make it my own (game-wise). This film has changed me and has made me understand more about the filming industry. So my rating is going to be 100%, deserving everything it has won, it deserves to be critically acclaimed, I will cherish this film forever. Oh, and buy the video-game too, if you love the film, you'll love this too Marlon Brando- Don Vito Corleone (April 3, 1924 - July 1, 2004) Dick Smith- Make-up Artist (June 26, 1922 - July 30, 2014) the godfather of make-up",positive

Seal of Approval.",negative
"The Godfather. Not much can be said about this film that hasn't already been said, as Francis Ford Coppola's Mafia epic is considered among the greatest movies of all time. So why has this gangster film been deemed a classic among classics? The studio heads held little faith in the film before its release--the gangster genre had fared poorly for years, Coppola's previous works were financial failures, actor Marlon Brando had become a Hollywood recluse and the rest of the cast was unknown at the time. Yet the story, characters, drama and action all came together to produce a masterpiece that became the highest grossing film ever (until the release of Jaws three years later) and won Best Picture at the Oscars. How was this film so wildly successful? Simple answer: it understood why its story needed to be told, and conveyed perfectly the complex emotions of ordinary humans who put themselves in extraordinary places. The story centers on the Corleone family, whose patriarch Vito (Marlon Brando) is also the head of a notorious New York crime syndicate which reaps the profits of city gambling and offers the services of hit men to paying clients. When passions flare against the rival Tattaglia syndicate, Vito is shot and hospitalized, forcing his sons Santino ""Sonny"" (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael (Al Pacino) to resolve the families' disputes. Michael, a decorated veteran of World War II, is charged with exacting revenge on the Tattaglia's, and it is here that the true genius of the movie is revealed: Michael becomes a tragic antihero, yet embodies the ordinary dream of a long, peaceful life. Can murder be justified if the victims are hardened criminals, and would it really differ from the killings Michael undoubtedly witnessed during the war? Though this moral question remains unanswered, Michael follows through on his plot, and must face the consequences of his killings even as he tries to abdicate himself of his sin. As a result, he comes to understand himself as he always has, as the good guy caught in a bad situation, and underestimates his capacity for ruthlessness. In Michael, the hypocrisy of humanity is unveiled for the sake of personal and familial survival, so the question is placed upon our shoulders: what would we sacrifice for the good of ourselves and our loved ones? And is the sacrifice worth it? The film as a whole draws much of its influence from strong Italian and Sicilian traditions running through the Corleone family, from their food and celebrations to the moral code they use to govern their money laundering schemes. In fact, each character in the movie is defined by how he or she (most of the time he) views and values these traditions, and how they reconcile Old World formalities with New World assimilation. The men who request justice through vendettas from their Godfather ""believe in America"", knowing that their own justice system is generally dependable despite its flaws in dealing with their own particular dilemmas. While the Don is of course a last resort, his clients still use his immense power as an expression of their freedom to choose their destinies, as Vito himself rose from rags to riches in much the same way that his followers aspire to. Vito runs his empire like a monarchy, praising and prioritizing his family while continuing to put them at risk due to his own position. Hypocritically, he wishes for Michael to escape to a civilian lifestyle while he has the chance, yet freely employs Sonny and Fredo under his command and charges them with helping to run the business. The irony of Michael's ascension as the new don is not lost on Vito, who bitterly regrets not realizing why his family was so important to him socially or spiritually when he was so concerned with their material well-being. Michael, who not by coincidence has the most American-sounding name in his family, distances himself at first from the shady dealings of his relatives and dismisses the role of tradition in his conscience, believing it to be too corrupt for his taste. Some combination of war, crooked cops, and Vito's newfound infirmity makes Michael realize that maybe, just maybe, there is no set of morals except those he dictates himself. Ultimately, what makes this film so powerful is its eloquence in pointing this out to everyone in the audience, sympathizing with the faulted figures of the film and not the faults themselves. Coppola, an Italian-American himself, certainly proved his capable hand at directing with this piece. Beautiful landscape shots, slow suspenseful close-ups, and rapid cause-and-effect contrast shots illuminate the story and drew my attention. Meanwhile, the sepia-toned cinematography was reminiscent of an earlier age of film, reflecting the bygone times portrayed by the plot and characters. The brass-knuckle brass of Nino Rota's score was foreboding and played very well into the moral complexity of each situation, emanating a sense of loose ends being wrapped up wherever the Corleone's make their mark. The editing is solid and ties the direction together, creating a feeling of restraint from hacking the story apart even as it does exactly that. The only flaws I could discern from the film were nit-picking the ""blink and you'll miss it"" slip-ups like fake punches and what not. All in all, a lot of the behind-the-scenes action built an extremely strong foundation on which to lay an equally powerful drama, so much so that The Godfather is deservedly the standard of modern cinema. While The Godfather sought merely to emphasize key aspects of Italian culture and introduce them to the American mainstream, it's gone far and beyond its call of duty and has become a pivotal cultural icon in itself. No screen-time is wasted as everything in this movie has a purpose, for better or for worse, a quality sorely lacking in many of today's self-proclaimed blockbusters. Reportedly, the Mafia themselves were flattered by the impact of the film. Even those unfamiliar with the film can recall its extremely memorable dialogue, from ""the offer he can't refuse"" to ""take the cannoli"". Is it the greatest film of all time? That's arguable. Is it a great film? That's without question. The Godfather is worth a watch for everyone, exposing and exploring the depths of humanity's weaknesses and the true meaning of its strengths.",positive

"""The Godfather"", a movie that has been talked about for decades. The movie does quite a few things superbly well. For one, the characters are well thought out and the whole mafia world is compelling from the start. The best part about the film is that everything is unpredictable, I couldn't really see any of it coming. This managed to keep me on the edge of my seat because I never knew what would happen next. The scenes are well put together and the performances are all well-done. I don't think I would put it among my all-time favorite movies as many film buffs seem to do, but I still think it is a very good movie that is well worth checking out.",positive
"Marlon Brando is not just an actor: he is a myth. He proves that acting as Vito Corleone. In a brilliant way, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo bring the italian family mafia novel to life.Definetly, it's a masterpiece.",positive

"I feel required to give it at least 4 stars just based on the near universal praise it gets. Being 3 hours though, you almost start comparing it to a TV show rather than other movies. It's a long movie, but some things almost feel rushed when you think about the pace of Breaking Bad or The Wire and how long they take to develop the plot since it's spread out over many hours.",positive
"What is there to say, it's a perfect Mafia movie about an italian family trying to keep there power in the USA in the 1930's. This is the mafia movie i've been waitin for.",positive

"Best Mafia Movie There is, Need i say more?",positive
"The Godfather is the gangster movie of all gangster movies, balancing family men with criminals and taking an audience deep into the underbelly of the mob while also making us feel for the characters. Everything in this movie is done right. Michael's transformation, the tragedy of Sonny and Vito, and the violence begetting violence all add up to one of the greatest films of all time. It is a necessary viewing for anyone and required for movie fans. Grade: A",positive
"I have had this movie for many months but i never got time to watch it. Yesterday i did and i think ,like everybody say ,it is one of the best movies made ever. Al Pacino who was not very popular at that time make his breakthrough performance and he is just great in the role of Michael Corleone. About the legend Marlon Brando,he is just phenomenal,his facial expressions and husky voice just make his role one of the best characters. It is based on Mario Puzo's novel about five fictional mafia families and Must say he did a great job on screenplay too. There are some great as well as shocking scenes in this movie i.e. When Woltz wake up and finds a real severed head of a horse. Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo. Prolonged fight between Connie and Carlo. Death of Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone. Death scene of Sonny ambushed by gang members at toll. The killings of all the other heads of Mafia families,Moe Green,Tesiso and Carlo. I loved the setting and style. James Caan,Richard S. Castellano,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton & Talia Shire did great jobs too. Despite the many Anachronisms,this movie is just marvellous. I have read everything that Coppola dis to make this movie so outstanding. Maybe the best gangster movie ever made. Thanks Paramount,Francis Ford Coppola and every Cast-crew member related for producing this chef-d'oeuvre.",positive
An all time classic! A drama like no other. My small BD collection would be incomplete without the Godfather Trilogy.,positive
A powerful crime drama.,positive
"Incredible film. Perhaps the most telling feature of this film was its ability to draw me in and keep me sucked in despite being shot and made before I was born. While many things in the moviemaking business have evolved and improved since The Godfather's creation, the film remarkably withstands the test of time. The performances are great, story is excellent (despite its length), and the action is strong. The film's intelligent creativity becomes the foundation for filming future to build on.",positive

"The Godfather is about the idea of family above all other values. It goes about letting us experience this idea with three plots. The main plot is the external plot to Save the Corleone family. Supporting plots include the external plot of Michael becoming an insider of the family and an internal plot of Michael's morality. Michael starts out an idealistic young man who looks down on the dirty deeds of the family business. In the end, Michael save the Corleone family. But in order to do so, he has become the ultimate insider (the Don) and loses the values he had held so dear at the beginning. It's a classic story that can be argued to humanize a criminal family by making us a member of it through Michael's transformation. The stakes are laid out such that we have to believe the ends justify the means. This idea, to protect the family at any cost, is taken to its logical extreme in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II and then the pied piper comes calling for payback in the finale The Godfather: Part III. But Part I is what stands apart from its distinctive internal arc of Michael. In the other two movies, Michael's determination and moral center never wavers, we just see the external world's consequences of his moral choices. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",positive
"THE GODFATHER is perfect. Unbelievable performances. Outstanding direction. Strong dialogue. Beautiful music. For the generations to come, THE GODFATHER will stand as a flawless film and possibly the greatest motion picture of all time.",positive
"It's easy to see why so many consider this to be the greatest film of all-time. Almost every aspect of film is perfected in this work, the acting is outstanding, the storytelling is unparalleled, the cinematography is dazzling and for a 2 and a half hour film it's paced brilliantly. There aren't many films I've seen as good as this, in fact the only film I think is better is Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'.",positive

"an American masterpiece. powerful, amazingly crafted, haunting. here is a film that has full respect in acting, directing, producing. the film broke new grounds with movie making as ""On the waterfront"" and ""Gone with the wind"" had. the storytelling is so modern and so crafted that its impossible to not declare this a work of art.",positive

Absolute masterpiece,positive
2nd best movie of all time. Surpassed only by its sequel.,negative
"Regarded as one of the most important and influential films of the century. This film has definitely changed the way gangster films are created. Back in the golden days of cinema, gangster films were notable for their violence and profanity. The Godfather changed the way contemporary gangster or crime films are approached. I don't want the review of this film be based on the film's impact but rather focusing on the film on its own. The film's story is based on a novel by Mario Puzo and written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola. Puzo's novel has been, before the film, has been a commercial and critical hit. I have not read Puzo's novel but Coppola's writing for this film is definitely entertaining. The film may have metaphors and deep layered themes but to me, it wasn't something I was looking for, as the story of this family is so damn entertaining that it did not need to be layered to be interesting. The strongest areas of this film focuses on the structure and functioning of the family business. The film also depicts the rise of Michael Corleone and how different he becomes when he becomes involved in the business he never wanted to be in the first place. Francis Ford Coppola has created the most acclaimed films of all time and all seem to be confined in the decade of the 70's. Each one of those films, aside from the Godfather sequel, is completely different from one another and at least one will appeal to a person. Coppola focused a lot on the culture and family aspect of this film which made this something unique. Though different from previous gangster films, it did not sacrifice on the areas that makes it exciting like the violence and tension. It still focuses on the competing families and the betrayal that is familiar in the genre. Brilliant direction has allowed every scene to be important in driving the story, there is no scene that does not drive anything for either the characters or the plot. Gordon Willis' cinematography feels like a picture or a video from an old camera that has aged. The film is dominated by a golden hue that gives the film that feeling of age.The film successfully feels like a period film and immerses you in the time period of the 1940's. Scenes like the wedding and the baptism are breathtaking. Willis has added in the film's lasting power as there are very few films that captures a moment in time so well as what he did for The Godfather and it's sequel. The film may feel slow to some people but I feel that it's important as it allows for characters to develop and the story to have more breathing room. The film is driven in detailed and intricate performances rather than spectacular and grand moments. How many of you have watched this film or at the very least heard the theme and gets stuck on your head for hours after you've heard it. As I am writing this, it's playing in my head. The score is something that would be heard in funerals or some other sad dramatic moment. The score is stays faithful to the film's cultural roots and at the same time making it something that sounds from a classic gangster films. Due to the film's score being so memorable and effective, it has become something composers of films in the same genre to go back to, in creating their scores. Iconic role played by an iconic actor. Vito Corleone can never be pictured played by another actor aside from Marlon Brando. The actor has played characters that are typical from leading actors and so seeing him in a character that was definitely at least 10 to 15 years older than his own during production, was a revelation. He embodied this respected and vulnerable man, and without a doubt outshone every actor in this film. Pacino was great as Michael but I felt he shows more of his acting capabilities in the second and third film. The entire cast works well together and each performance can be labelled as their most strongest in their career. This is one of the best films from Coppola. I cannot say this is his magnum opus because other films he has written and directed, Apocalypse Now and The Godfather Part II, are equally as powerful. The Godfather is an example of an amazing story, brilliantly acted and excellent direction in adapting an already iconic novel.",positive
"In their review naming this film the ""Greatest Movie of All Time"", Empire Magazine summarized The Godfather as ""A wedding. A horse's head. A gun in a restaurant toilet. Sicily. Another wedding. A car bomb. A toll-booth. Orange peel. A baptism. A closed door."" Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.",positive
I'm happy that this movie has brought joy to so many people but I don't get it,negative
Perfect movie but personaly I prefer part 2,positive
My all-time favourite. The best story and the best characters in any film.,positive
Best film of all time,positive
Probably The Greatest Of All Time !,positive
Great classic mobster movie.,positive
"One of the best Mafia movies of all time. This movie was brilliantly acted and directed. Aside from being lengthy it was a stellar film that starts it all. Stand out performances from Marlon Brando & Al Pacino. This movie is so good you tend to forget how old it is. It isn't quite as good as Goodfellas in my opinion, but it is a classic and a masterpiece none the less!",positive
"Make yourself an offer you can't refuse, and make sure you see this film!",positive
"Powerful, emotive, immortal story about a family covered with blood. Stunning performances and brilliant direction. A complete masterpiece.",positive
"An American masterpiece! Coppola knows how to write and direct true films. Marlon Brando delivers what I believes to be his most memorable performance. I loved every aspect of this movie, it'll never get old. Is it me or does anyone think James caan deserved and oscar for this movie? Highly recommended.",positive
Bad ass gangster movie,positive
"I was unable to get invested in any of the problems or characters, thus making me not care about them, thus making the movie rather boring. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give incredible performances, but as that is their default setting, it's not that impressive.",negative
godfather is classic as it gets,positive
"76% Saw this on 15/06/2013 I was having my vacation from the 20th of may to the 16th of June. I have been watching movies for these days and as of now Godfather is the 70th film that I have seen on my vacation. Godfather is a good crime drama. I simply loved the first hour and 20 minutes. The background music that comes during Pacino's hide out time and his short term marriage is mind blowing. I have seen a lot of similar films made in my language about the mob/gangster stuffs and I feel that they can all be closely related to films like The Godfather. Godfather's plot is nothing special, it is the execution and the acting that matters. As for the plot, we have the godfather, his clean son who is not a criminal and then comes the gang wars, drugs, the godfather's family is tormented and he is shot almost to death. Situations make the clean son to take up business and the more family slaughter and the the arrival of the new Godfather in style. I liked Marlon Brando more as the Godfather and the Don, he was just great providing ample acting abilities and all. I didn't like Al Pacino's Godfather role in the second half as much as Marlon Brando's. I don't know why, but when the don takes the back seat after the first half, I lost a lot of interest. There is one particular thing that made me annoy in this film, it's the love life of Al Pacino's Michael Corloene. Also Brando's Godfather is a man of honour and he does anything for the family, but Pacino on the other hand is a bloody liar, which is seen in the climax of the film. About the other thing, Michael Corloene(Pacino) had a girlfriend before he took hideout. Then one day, he got a thunderbolt from a girl whom he just saw and he decides to marry her. That too is alright. Then Michael' new wife is murdered and the next thing they show is him going back to this old girlfriend. What the **** is this? I have never quite acquainted with the American ideology of relationships, sometimes they make me feel like they stink. Might be it is because people from where I come are different from that of the Western people. This is why I often pity the American family dramas, they are mostly just bags of lies. Whatever it be, even when you take into consideration, the length of the film Godfather, it is an enjoyable film. If you ask me whether this is the best gang/mob/crime film, then my personal opinion will be a no and I would definitely say that it is The Departed(2006).",negative
"Awesome movie, with excellent play from the cast, and really good design.",positive
"I find the second one a little better, but right here we have the introduction to the best trilogy of all times, and the greatest pictures ever made. Every single detail is perfect, from the ""modern noir"" atmosphere to the astonishing actings.",positive
I really loved this movie. A must see!,positive
Who has not seen this movie all the God Fathers,positive
one of the best gangster flix ever,positive
"Perfecta , la mejor película estadounidense de toda la historia.",positive
"This epic crime drama is an absolute masterpiece thanks to the astounding direction of Francis Ford Coppola. It is quite easily one of the most flawless films ever made. Marlon Brando excels as aging crime lord Vito Corleone. Al Pacino gives a fantastic performance as Corleone's youngest son Michael. And Robert Duvall...oh come on it's freaking Robert Duvall, yet another one of the greatest actors of all time giving a top notch performance. this film is dark, it's suspenseful, it's tragic and violent but at the same time it is just beautiful.",positive
really good like it a lot.,positive
Super awesome gangster movie!,positive
An amazing movie i just loved everything about it !,positive
Excellent movie a classic!,positive

One best movies ever,positive
Great film. One of my all time favorites!,positive
"Probably is the greatest film I' ve ever seen, seriously, probably none other film will achieve this level of excellence. Great story, great cast, acting, music. In other words: Perfect!!!",positive
"This romanticized mafia tale is one of the most iconic and acclaimed movies of all time and rightly so. It transcends American cinema with a flawless script, beautiful dark cinematography, direction that allows the movie to flow like a novel and truly remarkable performances.",positive
There's nothing the matter with this movie it's all most perfect but there's something a little better about the other 2 movies.,positive
"While I can easily see this film extremely boring to some people and highly entertaining to most, I on the other hand am on the fence, well... more over to the positive side of it. It was terribly long but with remarkable acting and script. I wasn't so much drawn into it until about the 1-hour mark. Though certainly not the greatest film that I've seen, it's unquestionably fantastic with regards to placing the key elements which made it highly appreciated and unique in the first place. And I'm not just saying this to hop on the bandwagon but it truly was a great flick and worth the watch. It could have gone worse considering its overrated status and the apprehension of getting ultimately disappointed, but it ended great so there's that. And boy, was Brando brilliant in this film.",negative
"Possibly the best film ever made. I am not even kidding! From the opening scene with Don Vito Corleone's (played genuinely by Marlon Brando) and his daughter's wedding to the final moments when Michael (Al Pacino) delivers the final words to his wife Kay (Diane Keaton). Not only of the best and most accomplished films by director Francis Ford Coppola, but it is one of best films out there. I could go on into meaningless gibberish from the great performances from the cast to the setting and lighting creating mood to the whacks, the irony, the horse head, and lines in the film. Oops, there I go just spewing and gibbering. See this film at least once!",positive
"I am not a mafia-movie kind of person, which is the only reason this film didn't get 5 stars from me. There's not really anything to be said about this film that hasn't been said already; it's masterfully directed, brilliantly acted, and writing is perfect. I was particularly touched by the sense of family shown, and the beautiful displays of weakness by Marlon Brando. Al Pacino, as always, does his role proud with a delicate and profound character transformation. I was also particularly captured by the opening and closing shots of the film. Simply amazing work by Coppola.",positive
"The Greatest Gangster Film of All Time. It really shows that family and crime can work well in this beautifully crafted masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino really gave such tender and emotional performances in this movie. This one of the greatest films of all time. Whoever says its not, pull a James Caan on them.",positive
GREAT GREAT GREAT FILM GREAT CAST GREAT MUSIC HEY ALL I CAN SAY IS GREAT GIVE IT 1000/1000 THE WHOLE TRILOGY WAS GOOD,positive

"Holy crap. I like Mafia movies but maaaaan, I fell asleep during this one. A little boring for me, dude.",negative
Only took me 27years but I finally watched it! Just the rest of the trilogy to go... Loved it!!,positive
I love this movie. It has fantastic violent scenes and is put together well! Amongst the violence and drama the family unity is also very great! It is a crazy movie and action packed top 5 movie!,positive
"A true classic, the director makes you feel like your right in the room with the actors. A must see. Godfather II is another must see, hands down the best sequel ever done.",positive
A little slow but worth it.,positive
I can see why this is certified the greatest movie of all time,positive
i loved this movie! it keeps the audience guessing with everything that happens. The dedication of the cast was incredible throughout this movie,positive
"When watching this movie I felt like I was watching a reality television show, but better. The actors were amazing and I loved every single one of them. This movie is very iconic in many ways. The dialogue, characters, and story line made the movie what it is.",positive
Incredible movie with in-depth story and excellent villan-hero.,positive
"This is the pinnacle of all mobster-based films. If there is a such thing as a perfect film, this is truly it.",positive
"Godfather is far from my favorite mafia movie. It's classic status almost makes me cringe. I do believe it's a good film, but Scorsese has outdone Coppola in many ways with his body of work.",negative

one of the best movies of all time and certainly the best mafia movie of all time. a classic!,positive
"""The Godfather"" is chock-full of everything that we love in movies.",positive
"Brando and Coppola's masterpiece. A stunning movie. Truly one of the best, much like the tomatometer says, everything was done right, fantastic acting from everyone with a great cast, classic music filled iconic quotes. I don't think I've ever has three hours to so fast by. An amazing story and just nothing but praise, I don't think there is a negative to be found! There's nothing I can really say in short summary and I'd need to write a long review that no one wants to read, so I'll stop. Just watch it.",positive
best mobster movie ever,positive
"The Godfather is the basis for great American crime dramas. The writing is flawless and the story is engaging. Though it may feel slow at times, the performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are so memorable.",positive
Best film ever! Sensational.,positive
The film says it all really,positive
"Another movie that has everything, a mob, a funny Italian family, a cute couple and a horse head. I really like the potrayal of the mob in the 1950's. The story is fantastic, but the history behind the making of the movie and who the characters are based off of is even better than the story.",positive
One of the best mafia,positive
Al Pacino...Marlon Brando...Robert Duvall......ummm yeah that's really all i have to say,positive
"Wow this is an amazing movie. It's really hard to see just how much one film can be. I've seen so many homages without the original and I just get a wave of, I get it. This is an amazing movie.",positive
"Easily on the best movies ever filled with huge drama and emotiion. 3 hours will fly by as you immerse yourself in the crime family of the Corleones. Great acting by most, especially James Caan and Al Pacino.",positive
Finally saw The Godfather. Wow!!,positive
"greatest film of all time, a masterpiece",positive
If I had unlimited time i could watch it every month. Good life lessons & biz lessons... while still entertaining. I like 2 better than the 1st.,positive
hate to have a horse head in my bed one of a kind,positive
"Without a doubt the best American-Italian gangsta movie. A brilliant adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel, without the allusions to sex and surgical 'tightening' techniques for certain conquests of Sonny Corleone. The other storylines, into Vito Corleone's past, are covered in the film's sequel Godfather Part II. Excellent casting with Al Pacino as the young war veteren who comes of age to avenge his father's would-be assassins. Vito Corleone has been timelessly portrayed by Marlon 'jor'el' Brando! An absolute classic which must not be watched intoxicated!",positive
"Godfather was an alright movie. I dont think i will watch it again on my own time but for a movie of its time it did a good job. I think the story of the movie is told very well and the morals portrayed in the movie bring everything together, creating a more family oriented vibe throughout the movie.",negative
"The Godfather is a great movie that innovated the crime genre. It has a great story which (for a nearly 3 hour movie) moves quickly. We are brought close to the professional and personal lives of these mafia men, and when we see some of them gunned down, it's relatively hard-hitting. This was an innovation at the time: for a mafia film to bring us emotionally close to the characters. Perhaps the most shocking scene in the film (not to spoil anything) ends with a car riddled in machine gun bullets. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone can be seen as one of the most iconic performances/roles in film history: it is Brando transformed, and he's fun to quote back to. Like any movie that is labeled with such a ""legendary"" status, The Godfather is a tad overrated; but still very good nonetheless thanks to it's great story, performances, and iconic scenes.",positive
"The Godfather, by all means, should have an amazing storyline. Italian mobsters? How could it go wrong? Well, first off, by not ending the movie at any one of the thirty-six possible and acceptable ending points. The action was completely over by the 45-minute mark, but the movie dragged on for another two hours. Way too long to enjoy a decent movie at best. Does not deserve all it's attention nor the hype surrounding it as the best movie of all time. Good for falling asleep too, but that's about it.",negative
one of the greatest ever.,positive
"My second ( Blade Runner is the first) favorite movies of all times : The Godfather I,II and III. Suspense, drama, action, crime, family, stellar cast, purr-fection! I watched them 100 times!",positive
Best movie of all time. Nothing more needed.,positive
Sets the standard for mob movies.,positive
A great crime film this movie is the best I also love the theme.,positive
"Classic mafia film, with a very well played out story.",positive
"it is unquestionably great filmmaking with one of the all time best casts, but i did think it was very slow and uninteresting at some points. not my favorite mob movie, i'm more of a Goodfellas kind of guy.",positive
The best movie ever! It's enough.,positive
Greatest movie ever.,positive
"The performances are really good and I like how the movie ended in the final minute (before the credits), but it's overlong, too powerful, and possibly the most violent film I've probably ever watched. (B+) (Full review coming soon)",positive
Muito bom! Assistir de novo!,positive
"All the performances in this movie are simply stellar, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, it's a complete A-list production of one of the greatest autors, Francis Ford Copula weaves this story about America, murder, and family.",positive
"I am ashamed of myself for even one second doubting this particular piece. It is everlasting. Every detail was set in perfection. Well, yes there are some obstacles in technology and acting, but they weren't enough to shed any dirt on this piece's mighty artwork. I mean, come on, it was 1972 and the detail even better than most lousy film on this age. Salute. One of the greatest piece ever made.",positive
What is there to say that hasn't already been said? This is one of the greatest films of all time. I suggst you buy the blue ray collection so you can get all the deleted scenes because they are worth it.,positive
"Possibly one of if not the greatest movies ever made. It is good to watch on any and every day since its release. Quotes and dialogue that are timeless. And a message that stands the test of time. ""Don't every take sides with anyone against the family"". Classic through and through.",positive
I had to watch it a number of times to be able to fully understand (and perfect my impersonations) the movie BUT I love it,positive
While it is brilliantly acted and well shot. The godfather was just to much of a drag to watch and it removes you from its story and characters.,negative
"this movie is part of history. it is a must watch, Don't miss the opportunity to watch",positive
"Great classic of a mafia movie. Better still, based on the novel!",positive
"All hail the greatest film of all time! Yes I said it, The Godfather is a remarkable achievement in cinema. It did everything right in all departments. Brilliant acting all around, exceptional writing, an incredible story, and terrific directing from the great Francis Ford Coppola. Pacino, Caan, Cazale, and all are great to watch; but Marlon Brando is simply astonishing as Don Corleone, his greatest performance in his marvelous career. The setting is just perfect, and the story plays out perfectly and lets every emotion shown shine. I could go along a whole lot longer, but I'll leave you with this; The Godfather is no doubt the greatest film of all time, and if you truly enjoy cinema for its artistic value, The Godfather will amaze from the beginning to the very end and leave a lasting impression forever.",positive
"This week, 'The Godfather' trilogy was released on DVD, newly and meticulously restored. Having had the chance to re-watch the classic films, I've decided to add them to my Great Movies list. It's impossible to describe the impact that 'The Godfather' has had. Nearly everyone knows the famous quotes: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli."" And the pop culture references in movies and television are a record high. If I could name the most quoted, referenced, or parodied films it would be 'Star Wars', 'The Godfather', and '2001: A Space Odyssey'. I knew a group of teenagers in New York City who constantly did impressions of Marlon Brando or Al Pacino from 'The Godfather'. Everyone who sees the film loves it, in my experience anyway. I watched it with a good friend once who was shocked afterward to find out that the film is nearly three hours long: ""It didn't seem that long!"" It doesn't. The film has a spectacular pace, and is engrossing every minute of the way. The story of 'The Godfather' is universal. People so often categorize the film as a gangster movie. That is a horrible generalization. The film is about family. It is about protecting your family and fighting with your family. It's about the internal struggle to discover what is morally acceptable. It is a tragedy of ethics and standards. It is about a period of change. Change: A theme of the film. Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) swears he will never have anything to do with the family business. Kay(Diane Keaton) is devoted to Michael. Through the course of the film, their relationship and ethical behavior is shifted. Michael does become involved with the family business; more so, infact, than his brothers, Santino and Fredo. When it comes time to choose a new Don, Michael is chosen. Kay, who was devoted to Michael, starts to question their relationship. She becomes more independent than traditional marriages allow. Marriage: Another theme. There's the marriage between Vito(Marlon Brando) and his wife. A perfect, traditional marriage. The wife doesn't interfere with her husband's business. It is his and his alone. There's also Santino's(James Caan) marriage, in which he's having an affair. He's disloyal to his wife, yet his wife is not allowed to have a mind of her own, he tells her what she can and can not do. Michael has two marriages: one is in Sicilly to a young, beautiful girl. The marriage is young and passionate. Later, he marries Kay. He asks her as if he's proposing a business strategy. Their marriage is straight forward and passionless, mandatory. Alas, the movie starts with a marriage: The marriage of Connie(Talia Shire) and Carlo(Gianni Ruso). Carlo really does love Connie, but out of a moment of weakness, abuses her through a plot set up by a competitor of the family. The Family: Organized crime. The very thing that moves the plot along. Many people are killed. We are asked to what extent this is acceptable. Vito Corleone refuses to get involved in the drug business out of moral objections, yet it is told to us that earlier he forced a man to sign a contract by threatening to kill him. When his son, Santino, is killed, Vito calls for no acts of vengeance. Micheal, however, begins is career as the don by killing all threats and competition to the family. When asked by Kay whether or not he killed Carlo, Michael says ""No."" Kay smiles briefly with relief. However, her fears are revealed soon after as she fixes her husband a drink and has the door to his office closed on her. What has made 'The Godfather' last as long as it has is the fact that the characters are us. They reveal our own inner emotions and dilemmas. We connect with them and sympathize with them. We love and enjoy them. We loath them. Their emotions call out to us and become our own emotions. Has there ever been a more perfect film? 'The Godfather: Part II' perhaps?",positive
I never thought there would be a movie where I'm completely engaged by a father and son sitting down and just having a relaxing conversation... THIS MOVIE DID THAT!!! Thank you Marlon Brando and Al Pacino for making that one of my favorite scenes in the entire series!!! This is one of the greatest movies ever made!!!,positive
"The Godfather is one of the greatest films of all time. Out of the few movies that I can call perfect, this is one of them. Perfect Acting, Perfect Directing, Perfect Writing, Perfect Cinematography, Perfect Music, and Perfect Editing makes the Godfather a fantastic film, and undoubtedly the greatest Gangster Film",positive
"The Godfather is an interesting movie, with good acting and characters. It also has a great story, but has a faital flaw... It is way to long for it's story, it takes a lifetime to sit threw it! My god, I can't belive how Francis could do this...",negative
The most beautiful film ever created. The Godfather is much more than your average gangster film. It is a story full of strong emotions and teaches us many values of life. The mood of the story leaves you reflecting on your own character. This film will forever stand as a classic.,positive
"One of the greatest films in cinema history. The change in Michael from war veteran to Don Corleone is so beautifully orchestrated in violence, betray, corruption, etc. Marlon Brando's performance is the greatest acting you'll see for the rest of your life. The score is also phenomenal as is the cinematography and use of deep focus. One of the greatest movies you'll ever see, experience The Godfather.",positive
"Marlon Brando's best acting, with bravura and mob mentality fully captured in this classic near-perfection crime drama.",positive

"The Godfather is a stark and stunning portrayal of the mob, featuring fine performances by the whole cast.",positive
Flawless and intense. The gangster movie that can never be topped.,positive
Godfather is unspeakable of how a cherished masterpiece it is. AFI rated as one of the greatest which I totally agree only matched by the sequel which is helled as one of greatest sequel of all time up their with empire strikes back and the dark knight. Not many films are kept to such high standards but since the godfather trilogy came out not many can top the quality and scope. These movies are always be to me a inspiration for me as a storyteller.,positive
"The film is about a ""good man"" who can't fight against himelf. Evden he try to be a right person, he can't.. A moral fight among a clasical catholic family.The film is about a ""good man"" who can't fight against himself. Even he tries to be a right person, he can't. A moral fight in a classical catholic family.",positive
The Godfather is la movie that is a pioneer for all other crime and mystery movies. It tells the story of organized crime from a different point then most people are used to. This movie is told from the inside out which is unusual for movies of this nature. And the best part being that the story is told very well at the same time filled with lots of realism. The Godfather is a fantastic movie that tells crime in a new way.,positive
Lástima que no hay una sexta estrella. Es la más brillante y potencial obra maestra cinematográfica que han apreciado mis ojos. Es algo memorable.,positive
Masterpiece of the masterpieces,positive
A beautiful movie with a plot that makes you sympathize with gangsters. Now that's a well done movie.,positive
"For years I have avoided watching The Godfather, simply because of the hype surrounding it. I always expected to be disappointed and that it wouldn't live up to the reputation it has garnered. After finally watching this movie all the way through, I can see why it's considered one of the best American films ever made. In my opinion, Martin Scorsese's GoodFellas is the best gangster film of all-time, but The Godfather is right up there with it, neck-and-neck. These are easily the two best films in the genre and it's not even close. A subtle, realistic, and powerful film, The Godfather is a though-provoking story of multi-generational crime. Taking place in the late 1940's in New York, this film is centered around the Corleone family, which is headed by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). His youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), has long avoided the family business, but finds himself in the thick of things after multiple assassination attempts on his father. This is a brilliant story about family, love, and the results of violence. It's so much more than just a gangster movie. Just a quick glance at the cast list tells you everything you need to know. You have Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall all giving outstanding performances. The dialogue is absolutely incredible, really building up the characters and their personalities. This is a complex film aimed at an intelligent audience expecting much more than just a ""shoot em up."" The story is superb, and it gradually builds up throughout the three hour run-time. The Godfather is a true masterpiece that I waited far too long to experience. 5 stars.",positive
"Funny, I had seen many clips and bits and pieces of this movie but never the film in its entirety until now. Long. Great acting. I found Sunny to be the most likeable and intriguing character and the one I missed sorely when he was killed. It's so strange seeing these big, older actors that I know so well looking so baby-faced and young here. The best moment, the one that stuck out to me the most, was the juxtaposition of Michael being named his nephew's godfather and reciting a prayer, while at the exact same moment his men are carrying out numerous bloody hits around town... it's eerie and my favorite part in the whole film. I think it's a must-see for any student or lover of film, just to say you've seen it at least. I would never, however, go so far as to say this movie is perfect or the ""greatest film"" ever. Sometimes it's just downright uninteresting with too much talking. I think it's because I'm used to gangster films being guns and extreme violence all the way through, with hardly any attention towards actual plot or character development. This movie isn't like that and I give it kudos on that front. It's a good movie, with wonderful acting, but I don't think it's flawless like many others seem to.",negative
"direction,acting and violence first class entertainment,you never would think of messing with the family",positive
"The Godfather is considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made, that got me really excited two years ago. When I watched the movie, I was highly disappointed. It was the most boring, draggy and overrated movies I had ever seen. That was two years ago, I watched it again. My review now. A crime epic, The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son. -IMDB I liked this movie so much better than from the last time I watched it. The first time I gave it a 5/10, big improvement. Probably because I've become more of a critic in that period of time. I'm not going to say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, not at all. However this is still a very good movie. The best part about the movie, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. Brando leads this movie like he was bore to, not a single mess up as one of the greatest movie characters in cinema, definitely deserving the Oscar. Al Pacino does equally great work as Michael, his favored son born to lead the family, should have won his Oscar. While I do not agree that Pacino was nominated for Supporting Actor while Brando for lead actor. Brando didn't have more screen time and the movie wasn't even centering on him. Other great work comes from beginners James Caan and even Robert Duvall. The movie had an excellent script to work with, Francis Ford Coppola directs this movie like a master (He got an Oscar nomination for directing). He also wrote the script which I'm giving the man even more credit for his work. The costume design, fantastic. The set design also worth mentioning. But my favorite part, the quotes. This movie is full of some of the most memorable quotes in any movie. My personal favorite, ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse."" Now the gangster genre isn't my favorite. I really liked Pulp Fiction but other than that I haven't had any exceptions. The story of The Godfather to me stretches far too long. It's a near three hour movie and at moments I started to get bored and a little sleepy. But then BOOM! Something happens that catches my eye and it continues to entertain me. If you're not interested in this type of movie, you'll hate it. Trust me, I used to. This movie is a very good movie. I'm not going to say it makes my top 30 or anything. The acting is great, one of the best casts ever put to film, an excellent script and directing from Francis Ford Coppola. But again, the story goes on too long. I give it a 8 out of 10",positive
Very pleased I finally made the effort to watch this. The running time even caught me off guard a bit. Definitely a classic. Hope 2 & 3 live up to the trilogy hype,positive
Our first insight into the Corleone mafia family. Long dramatic criminal intrigue,positive
Simply the Greatest Movie Ever Made and is a must watch whilst it may not be my favourite movie it is certainly a great one. No other film has impacted me the way this one has...,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
"This strange panache of over the top melodrama, genuine artistry and self-important heaviness yields a few great moments.",negative
"An epitome of Hollywood filmmaking by director Coppola, the Godfather shows off the best elements a movie could possibly possess in such a subtle, sensitive way, that even amid the great prosperity of the Corleone family, we could still vaguely feel that unspeakable lonesomeness and dreadful melancholy of the godfather. The movie isn't just about cold-blooded assassination and family warfare; it's also about genuine loyalty and family love. In the tangle between outer-family business and inner-family affair, Vito Corleone must take a side and choose his priority. At the end of the film when we see him make a face at his grandson, we also see a guilty devil smile so jovially like an angel... As Vito falls and the legend wanes in his own family garden, his son Michael succeeds as the Don. I wonder, as the next Don, what will Michael Corleone choose as the godfather?",positive
"There's no doubt on why The Godfather is often considerated as the greatest film of all times; this Francis Ford Coppola's marveously directed and written masterpiece is a powerful, entertaining gangster story, with many unforgettable and classical quotes, and impeccable performance by Marlon Brando and its supporting cast.",positive
"A perfect film. This one, along with part II, are the greatest American films ever.",positive
"Absolute masterpiece. One of my favorite gangster movies, although I would have to rank Goodfellas above it.",positive
there's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this film,positive
good old school gangster movie!,negative
Such a wonderful blend of actors and an amazing story that pulls you in!,positive
"It is the best !!! Flawless !! Especially Marlon Brando did an awesome job ,arguably the best movie in motion picture history !",positive
Doesn't get much better!,positive
"One of the greatest films ever made and the best work by Francis Ford Coppola, this movie looks even better on blu-ray. There are superb performances all around especially by Brando, Pacino, Caan, & Duvall. Even the little things like the intentional changing of the color of the film creates a great look and mood. The score is fairly simple yet adds the right amount of music for any given scene. It stands as one of the best movies ever made and still lives up to it to this day. If you haven't seen the Godfather yet then now is the time.",positive
"GROSSLY OVER RATED. 3 hours of old Italian guys sitting around talking. What a snoozefest. Seriously, I fell asleep 5 times in the first 2 hours and ended up turning it off. I can't for the life of me fathom why this is so highly rated. Utter fucking garbage. Oh and don't get me started on Marlon Brando's voice. Talk about finger nails on a chalk board. Don't get me wrong, there are great actors in this but they can't save a dull script.",negative
"Now this is a film. classic film Brando's acting is just perfect, so is Caan's, Pacino's whole cast is just perfect the story is long but very interesting and deep and emotions. one the most important elements which does help the film is respect and values. About family, loyalty and honor. this is one if not the greatest movie ever made.",positive
"This movie was very descriptive about family interests and the way everyone veiwed family. I like the way the camera moved across the screen as to focus on one persons emotions. The film was very descriptive in the shootings. The one thing i didnt like was how people got shot, it looked fake.",negative
"This, was definitely the best movie I have ever seen and it is a joy to watch. It tells a telling story of a new york mafia family trying to gain position on the top of New York crime through eliminating the heads of other mafia families. Of course, that is just putting in a nutshell one of the greatest drama's of all time, nay. One of the greatest films of all time. Honestly, I loved this movie and truly enjoyed watching it. As a critic, I understand why this is such a greatly reviewed and talked about movie of all time. Certainly a film to watch over and over again.",positive
"""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece.",positive
Can you find a more boring and complete waste of film? These actors are of the highest caliber and their skills couldn't even make this movie a 1 star. How/why people are interested/fascinated by this type of movie I will never know.,negative
one of the best sequel ever,positive
Immersive performances and impeccable cinematography. The soundtrack is gorgeously moody. A masterful American epic.,positive
"mehhhhhhh. Just trollin'. I love Pacino in this, and in most things really, but in this! Everything that needs to be said has been said many times before so I'd feel like I was wasting breath, well type-breath, by going on. All I want to say is that I'm not a long-time Godfather fan- I can't do impressions of Vito or quote lines as life-lessons, I've seen the trilogy twice maybe and this instalment once or twice more than that. My point is that this film earns it's rating from beginning to end- you don't have to be in some Godfather fan club to appreciate this one, you simply have to watch it. Despite how undeniably great it is, it still won't be to everyone's taste- so if it's not your thing, don't feel worried. I was worried I wouldn't enjoy it when I first saw it. I did, but I was worried that I wouldn't and that's bad because no film should be judged on reputation alone, the films with those great reputations, like this one, are the films that definitely SHOULD be watched before they are judged. If you don't like them- fine, don't be so quick to call them over-rated though because that's just stupid. *insert intimidating Godfather quotation here*",positive

Best movie of all times. Just like that.,positive
Among the best movies ever made.,positive
"Hmm. The Godfather is often touted as the greatest film of all time. That's a tough moniker to live up to. So, it's perhaps indicative that, yes, maybe it is, that one can watch The Godfather, given the hype, and still be blown away. The story of the Corleone family and reluctant-emergent mob boss Michael is an epic one, spanning an entire decade, and doing so with the greatest of ease. A very smart, very deep and very self-aware script is performed brilliantly by the pitch-perfect cast - Pacino and Brando both shine, epitomising their characters and the archetypal mobster. Coppola is a masterful hand at the till, and Gordon Willis' cinematography is top notch. Is this the greatest film of all time? Hard to say. The Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Toy Story, they all have something to offer to claim that they're the best, but it's hard to imagine a film more perfectly crafted film than The Godfather.",positive
One of my favorites.,positive
"I won't listen to anybody who calls this overrated (which I heard so many times prior to viewing). Worthy of all the superlatives it's given. Brando is at the pinnacle of acting done by anybody, and let's not forget Pacino, Caan and Duvall, great actors all at their finest.",positive
GREAT MOVIE. THE WAY THE BLU RAY VERSION BRINGS OUT THE COLOR OF THIS CLASSIC IS AMAZIN,positive
"In my opinion, it is the best movie ever made. A trully masteripice. The whole film has very emotional scenes, great actings and a great story. If you see the movie, you'll know what i'm talking about.",positive
Wow a great movie !!!!,positive
Insightful! A new way of looking at The Mob.,positive
The world stops when you watch this movie. Coppola made a masterpiece when he put this group together. Brando is incredible. Pacino is brilliant the way he is able to evolve his character.,positive
"Simlply the best and ""almost perfect"" movie that i've ever seen. Francis Ford Coppola just had made an masterpice from cinema were we can see such an intriguing and a superb vision of the ""gang-mafia-bussniess"". Not only with the marfia world, but at the same time family issues and honor. The way Coppola directs the film is amazing, the way he shows the Mafia's family in a such realistic way, you start feel part of the family, we begin to worry about the characters in so impressively way. And at the same time with the honor of the family, with the actions they make, we simply enter in the mafia's world of Coppola. The entire cast is perfect in their roles, Robert Duval and Al Pacino are just perfect, but Marlon Brandoo ownes the movie. As I say before, it is just the Masterpice from cinema and just the part 1 from this awesome and powerfull movie!",positive
"Nearly perfect, one of the best ever.",positive

"I had a rough time watching The Godfather, because all the universal acclaim was completely clouding my judgement on the movie, because instead of being able to watch the movie with clarity, all this time I was looking at the opinions of the general public as the basis of finding clear reasons why to like this movie. I know everyone praises the performances, the film's structure, and every subtle nuance, but listening to those opinions gave me the idea I should be looking at these details so I will see why this movie is so great. But to my realization, I wasn't trying to find any qualities that I, MYSELF, would love about the movie. I was too busy trying to find the details of what other people liked. I was watching based on the details other people hyped up too much. That's why I have to say, you have to watch The Godfather and put the hype completely behind you and just watch it for what it is just how you would any other movie. If you develop a true opinion of the movie, not based on the hype, then that's what really matters, whether you love it or hate it. I ended up watching The Godfather for the umpteenth time. Now, before this point I really didn't have an opinion on the movie. I honestly felt it was bland and didn't give me that sense of urgency a lot of my favorite movies give me, but I didn't hate it, but I also didn't love it. But this time, it clicked somehow. I enjoyed it, oddly. I honestly found a certain quality that is very hard to create in films. And that certain detail is how beautiful this movie is. Behind all the murders and the brooding feel of the film, there is a lot of beauty. It's atmosphere is something that contrasts so heavily with its dark plot. And not only visually, but this is also evident in the execution of the acting performances, and the mood of the story. After watching Apocalypse Now and The Godfather II, I finally started to understood Francis Ford Coppola's style of storytelling. Despite The Godfather being a gangster film, it's very subtle and does not have any melodrama. I feel this is something people cannot get past, because with its legacy as a movie, they expect it to be something more in-your-face that will give you an emotional hit-in-the-gut feeling, but to one's realization, he or she will realize it is not those things. I mean there is a beautiful score, but it too is very subtle. The movie actually benefits from silence and just let the characters most of the time direct the emotion of the plot. When watching this, I cannot believe how the actors were able to execute this difficult-to-accomplish feat. If you were to tell me how I would expect one of the best ever movies to come off as, I would've given you a narrow-minded answer. Now I realize how much film is just as open-ended as music. We cannot just experience or enjoy an album or a film one time and expecting to gain that satisfaction thinking we know it from the inside out. If we watch a movie a second time, we can discover subtle nuances that weren't obvious in the first viewing, almost as if we're watching it from a completely different angle. And that's the beauty of i Despite how subtle The Godfather is, it really is a sophisticated film with repeated viewings. Is The Godfather my favorite movie of all time? I don't even know if I have one particular favorite, but I would place it in my top ten along with Citizen Kane. My advice would be to find certain qualities that YOU would like about The Godfather and not to base it on the opinions of people telling you what is so awesome about it, because film is more open-ended than that to build expectations. We all have things that we personally love. What is the best thing about the movie? For you or anyone else, it could be the acting, the story, the settings, or some subtle nuance that everyone is ignorant of. I personally love the mystical feel of the atmosphere and I think that is better than telling someone its the best movie ever just because it is. I like to listen to personal opinion, because of the individuality aspect to it. And The Godfather is way more rewarding if you watch it as an individual and judge it on your principles of what makes a good film and not to trust someone else's certainty that is the best movie ever. It's okay if you still don't like the movie, but what is crucial is you give complete clarity in forming an opinion that is completely your own based on what is important to you, most of all. I don't see what other film lovers see in The Godfather, I only see what I love about it.",positive
The best movie ever made and if you dont agree with me something is definently wrong with you.,positive
"I was extremely fortunate to be able to watch this at the cinema last year. This is quite simply the greatest gangster film I have seen. Inspiring countless imitations, The Godfather continues to be influential to the films of today. Brando, Pacino and indeed Coppola are on top form here.",positive

Marlon Brando was one great actor.,positive

"I saw the godfather yesterday, it was such an amazing movie. It is a great movie about a mafia crime family. The movie was very long however it is a very great movie and it will always be one of the greatest movie ever made.",positive
"I'm sure at the time this movie came out it was a big succes, yet watching it now it seems extremely slow and boring. The story could've moved a lot quicker without loosing any of it's strength. But than again, this movie was made a long time ago so I can forgive it's speed.",negative
The only film I can think of that is possibly better than this is the Godfather: Part II.,positive
"One of the greatest American movies. Or quite simply, one of the greatest films ever made.",positive
It was interesting and informative.,negative
"This really is as good as its reputation would have it be -- tightly plotted, perfectly paced, brilliantly acted. I just wish that DVD rental places made sure their DVDs weren't scratchy or dirty -- I'd rather not have missed the few lines I did.",positive
"One of cinema's legendary efforts, The Godfather is a tightly edited, incredibly complex and brilliantly directed look at what has become one of the world's most famous families. Famous for its compelling plotline and a sensational cast (including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall), The Godfather may be rather slowly paced, but it makes up for it in nearly every other department.",positive
An American film classic in every sense of the word. The Ultimate mob epic that will never be topped. The theme of family and business always at odds with one another is what makes this film truly timeless.,positive
Masterful performance by Brando. Horse head in bed is an unforgettable scene.,positive

The greatest movie in cinematic history and my favorite movie of all time!!!!,positive
"One of the greatest movies of all time. The Godfather is filmmaking at its best. Those who have not seen this movie should set aside three hours and watch it. It will be worth the time. I score Marlon Brando's performance a perfect ten. I give the entire cast the same score. The Godfather is one of the most beautifully filmed movies of all time. It is well written too. The ending is among the most violent, but dramatic ones I have ever seen. The Godfather is three hours of pure delight, creative visuals, excellent acting, strong writing, memorable moments, and perfect directing. I give The Godfather an A with only god knows how many pluses.",positive
"Being popularly seen as the best movie of all time, my expectations were high when I saw this film. At first I felt confused and disappointed. It seeme boring. IT was nothing extraordinary. But as the plot went on, big stuf was happening, and we got a whole lot insight to all the characters, and the story quickly turns very interesting. I will admit I felt bored at times, but it still was a spectacular film as a whole, with such a great story and incredibly welldone performances.",positive

"The Godfather a film what has inspired so many of todays media and films. It brought so much to the table, the importance of family and the corruption between business and politics. Before i get into to the film i would like to praise Al Pacino and Marlon Brando as they play the best performances in this film both definitly oscar worthy. To this day i cannot think of any other actor who could have played the parts better than these two. Marlon Brando is such a diverse actor from playing in musicals to becoming a respectable mafia boss, Marlon purs his emotions onto the screen which is a git for all of us to watch. Al pacino who plays Michael Corleone is a calm but fiesty character, he can change within seconds from nice guy to his loud abnoxious character it's an incredible character played well by Al pacino. I also ave to admire Francis Coppola's directing skills because he did not hollywood or glamourize the film, he kept it very traditional and it worked well with this film. To b honest i am not one for 'old movies' per say because they are predictable and i find the acting very over dramatic and the big put off the quality of the sets they use and quality of the film. I had seen every other major gangsta movie except from the three Godfathers, which are all fairly recent films with the likes of goodfellas (1990) and casino (1995) which i found were great films, so basically i was pretty sceptical to watch these films, i didn't know much about them and i thought they would be very old fashioned, but boy was i wrong. I have never seen a film with such great lighting and camera shots. The locations were breath taking and memorable. The storyline was compelling and intense at times. The very first scene has you hooked to the film with a rich black darkness and a golden white light shining on the man talking about his daughter and wanting justice from Don Corleone, The camera slowly zooms out as he speaks and pure italian accent with his english language is beautiful begining to a film. A simplistic but effective camera technique which grabs the audiences attention. One of my favourite scene's 'connie's wedding'. The italian/american way of life al bundled into one. The music, the food, the dancing but most importantly the family ethics. hey are very happy and have so much respect for one another it brought a smile to my face. This resepct is shown well when Sonny Corleone breaks a camera from the press because it was disrespectful but he still threw money at the press agent for him to buy a new one. When everyday civilians ask favours from The Godfather, The Don dosen't ask for money but for friendship and for the favours to be paid back whenever he called upon them for it. The Godfather's currency wasn'nt money but it was respect and loyalty. The Don is a very legimate man, owning an respectful Olive Oil businuess which was brought over from the old country Sicily. Don does not like funny businuess because he has high powered friends and politicians metophirically in his pocket Don feels that a deal with the Dittalia's for the narcotics would be a bad move for the Corleone family and refuses. When Michael realises his father maybe feared dead, Michael became a man of action and goes to the hospital to protect his father. It's from this point i feel Michael comes into his own, he rises up to protect his family by getting rid of threat of Solazo and the corrupt poilce chief who cowardly punched Michael because he was on the dittalia family's payroll. As Michael killed Solazo and Poilce Chief he fled to Sicily to avoid any dangers from the other familys and the poilce, leaving behind his fiance Kate. For me this is what the Godfather is all about, the old country. Away from all the crime and city life to the beautiful countryside and peacful town of Corleone. When we see Michael in Sicily we see a lot more wide angle shots to see the astonoshing setting wheras in America we see more medium shots so we concentrate more on the people. It's a refreshing scene because instead of seeing the busy city of New York we are now in a tranqual and peacful town. The colour contrast also chnages because we now see more earthy colours like green and yellow wheras in the city there was more neutral colours like black and grey. In some areas of the film i can tell that the lines are scripted because the words what they use are meanigful and would take a long time to think of but in this film i think it works well because the film is based on a book and Coppola and Mario Puzo the creator of the book made an excellent screenplay. Overall i find this film a joy to watch because of the transformation and shift of power, the corruption of businuess and politics, but most importantly family morales. I admire the Corleone family so much because they love each other so much and treat one another with respect, i will carry this film with me in my head when ever i may be and possibly use the importance of family when i have my own.",positive

Never Seen it like I said before about the other Godfather Movies,positive
"Veto Corleone ""The Godfather"" (Marlon Brando) is the Don Corleone. The Don of a mafia family means the head. He is the most powerful Don in the world. He is loved, feared, and worshipped. He is vicious, brutal, but you love him. You love him because he is a family man that will do anything to help a family member. They develop that more in the book, and in the flashback sequences of the 2nd film. The film starts off on the day of his daughters wedding, and the Don can't refuse a request on the day of his daughters wedding. A man whose daughter had been raped by a few boys is requesting for justice, and he wants him to murder them. The Godfather says that is not justice because his daughter is still alive, but he will take care of them. It is a long scene that gets imitated, and many parodies have been done from that scene. It is a classic scene that I love. What's unique about it is the acting the look, the voice, personality, and the lines that Marlon Brando has in the scene. It is one of many things in the film that makes it so remarkable. When an assassination gets attempted on him he is put in a coma after being shot five times in the back. He got shot because he refused to accommodate Turk Sollozzo in his drug dealing business because that would upset his political connections, and he would lose some of his power. His son ""Santino"" accidently said what he was thinking and Sollozzo and the Tattalgias knew that if Santino became the new Don that he would get the Corleone family involved. The whole conflict in this movie is caused because he refused an accommodation for the first time. It is also about how for the first time the other Mafia families have struck against the Corleone family and weakened them significantly. It is also about how the Corleone family makes a comeback, and takes back power and control in the end. A war breaks out between the two families it is the first challenge against the family and that is what makes the film so great. Another huge part of the story that makes the film so great is because it has a breaking Bad element in it. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is the youngest and most talented of the Corleone children, but he hates the fact that his family is nothing but a bunch of criminals and killers. He is a war hero, and a graduate of Dartmouth University, and he will probably become a really brilliant businessman. When his father gets shot he decides to help him and he ends up getting his jaw broken for it. He decides to kill Turk Sollozzo and the crooked cop who broke his jaw. From that point on the story becomes how he goes on to become the most powerful Don in the world. It is a fantastic movie. Michael Corleone is a brilliant man. He is smart, clever, and wise. He never makes a mistake. He plays people like puppets. That is why you see the puppets on the poster. He is much colder then his father. His father makes it less dark, but in the 2nd one when Marlon Brando wasn't in it the film was much more dark. This one is much more happy then the first one, because it isn's all of him. You still like him though, because he is brilliant. Another one of the best acting jobs in the film is James Caan's performance as Santino Corleone. He played him exactly as he was presented in the book. A hot-headed guy that would lose his temper all the time, and that famous temper did him in. He is intense, and impulsive. This was James Caan's best acting job of his career in my opinion. The film has many lines that have are used in our daily lives a lot now. Such as ""Sleeps with the fishes."" That is another way of saying that somebody is dead, and their body is at the bottom of the ocean. In the book the line is ""Luca Brasi is sleeping at the bottom of the ocean."" The film's dialog in awesome. It is mostly talking scenes, but the talking scenes are great. One of many things in this film that is perfect. The Godfather is an epic film that set the standard and formula for all other mafia films. This is the all time greatest guys movie. Based off of Mario Puzo's book of the same name, which is my favorite book too. Mario Puzo wrote the book and the screenplay for this phenomenal movie, that defines genius, and masterpiece. The film is dark, complicated, thought provoking, and hard to follow. I liked it the first time, but after I read the book and saw it again I thought it was absolutely incredible. It got better and better each time until I saw it for the fourth time. Since then it has just stayed just as good as it was the last time it got better. The movie is extremely similar to the book, because the screenplay was written by the author of the book Mario Puzo. But of course the book has more detail. Some of the details in the book that got cut out from the screenplay I am glad were cut out, like the stuff with Johnny Fontane with his ex wife after the incident with the director of the film he wanted to be in. Those were unnecessary details that I was glad they cut out. Certain things in the book that are better are scenes like when Michael Corleone kills the ""Turk"" and Captain McClusky. In the book it tells you what is going through his mind during the scene, and I remember I could not put the book down during that part. I always get distracted reading books for some reason, but I didn't with The Godfather. The movie is perfect, but unfortunately it can't tell certain details from the book. Another thing in the book that isn't in the first film is the story of how Veto Corleone became the head of the most powerful Mafia family in the world. But that was in the 2nd movie, so I was happy with that. Other then a few details left out from the book this movie was absolutely perfect.",positive

Marlon Brando gave one of the best acting performances I have ever witnessed and Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone's demise into evil was brilliant and spot-on. Can't wait to watch Part 2",positive
"The Godfather has to be the quintessential gangster film. I believe this is the greatest film about the cruel underworld that lies just beneath the surface of what we deem a civilized society. There is something so magnetic about seeing men who have strong ties to their families, deep moral codes of conduct (at least in some conduct--murder, lying, and all the other corrupt actions not withstanding), social strategies to eliminate other human beings who pose a threat, and the other people in the family who have to deal with the realities of who they are in the big old sham of living ""the good life"" under the guise of such dastardly behavior, that keeps me watching this film over and over again. This film stands alone in a genre that is saturated to the rim with it's typical themes, scenarios, and stereotypes.",positive

"One of the best movies ever made. I definitely agree with that statement. Francis Ford Coppola made a masterpiece that defined what cinema is all about. Iconic quotes like ""Im gonna make him an offer he cant refuse."" and performances by excellent actors make this movie.The story follows the Corleone gangster family and all the tragedies and events that change the family forever most notably Michael Corleone and his father Don Vito Corleone both played brilliantly by a very young Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in iconic performances. James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Cazale,Talia Shire and Diane Keaton also co star in memorable performances that contribute to the story.The transformation of Michael from a man who wants nothing to do with his crime family to ruthless gangster is one of the most subtle and disturbing elements of cinema. I like to think of it as the dark unconventional side of the Hero's Journey. The film is just epic in scope, spectacle and storytelling. From the well shot cinematography to the haunting score by Nino Rota to the engrossing yet tragic story, ""The Godfather"" remains a timeless classic.",positive
"The absolutely best in it's class, if you haven't seen it don't waist anymore time!",positive
"The most iconic and most legendary movie in history which is the most ruthless mafia movie ever and winner of 3 oscars. The legendary Marlon Brando delivers not only an oscar worthy performance but one legendary portrayal as Don Vito Corleone. Not to mention a ruthless portrayal of Michael Corleone from a young,now iconic Al Pacino.",positive
"What more can I say other than ""WOW' Brando was back in this one",positive
"With uninteresting characters, unclear message, overrated acting and dull story, the Godfather is an EXTREMELY OVERRATED film. EXTREMELY.",negative

one of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
"Last time I reviewed this I sounded like an ignorant and overzealous fanboy. My opinion hasn't changed though, this IS a masterpiece and there is no way around that. Brando and Pacino alone make this worth watching. The mood, music and story are great too. It really keeps you enthralled. It's a long movie so make snacks and use the bathroom. The length feels appropriate though, however. It develops a strong plot over time and great characters. Although, I do think the sequal slightly surpasses this one, there is no doubt that this a movie for the ages.",positive
"The best movie, EVER.",positive
"this movie is no doubt the greatist movie ive ever seen in my whole life. i can watch this movie over and over and over with out getting bored. great story, superb cast and defineately can set in the mood. almost feels like you're in the movie",positive

I'm not worthy of rating this movie. Neither are you.,positive
"good, a tale of intelligence greed and deception and Italians",negative
Easily the best movie ever made!,positive
"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.. With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..",positive
number 3 is my favourite,positive
I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. See this film.,positive
One of the best of all time! Absolutely brilliant performances from an all-star cast. Al Pacino is riveting as the man that can't escape his family or his destiny.,positive
The best movie from a critical standpoint that I have ever seen.,positive
"This American motion picture classic provides the ideal learning tool for anyone who is interested in the organized crime-genre of film and the foundations for any aspiring actor, director, producer, composer and writer who decides to take the steps to becoming a cinematic legend. The simple, yet strangely complex plot derives from the Corleone dynasty as they face the repercussions of their criminal activity since the 1920s. The storyline, centers on Vito Corleone's (portrayed by two-time Academy-Award winner Marlon Brando) renunciation as the patriarchal figurehead of one of the ""Big Five"" organized crime families of the day and the ascension of his reluctant son Michael (Al Pacino) as his successor. Regarded as one of greatest films in world cinema, The Godfather reveals a chilling insight into the world of underground mafia led by this Italian-American empire by the ever-so intimidating presence of Brando as he appears on screen. Brando's transfixed facial expression and unnerving speech captures the stereotypical mafia leader with ease and is truly the focal point of the picture - with Pacino's performance a close second. The premise of this picture is clear - family loyalty - regardless of whether your next of kin is in the right or not. Something, which Connie and Michael Corleone fail to recognize as essential for desiring acceptance into the ""business"". That is, for Michael, until his father's health is jeopardized as a result of his foes seeking vengeance and instigates Michael's sudden change of heart. The incessant drawing of how accurate Coppola represents the typical American-infused Sicilian mafia family truly draws one's eyes until the credits come rolling in. A definite ""thumps up"" for anyone interested in movies and a thought-provoking mind. One of the best films I have seen in my entire life and it will leave you scrambling to find and watch the sequels that follow!",positive
"The Godfather Trilogy, there cannot be enough said. It is one of the greatest pieces in movie history.",positive
"In my opinion, this is the the greatest film of all time.",positive
The greatest film ever made.,positive

a great family movie,positive
Undoubtedly the greatest film ever made since or after citizen kane.....,positive
"Flawlessly executed mafia saga based on Mario Puzo's novel. Madia boss Vito Corleone refuses to enter into the narcotics games, starting a shockingly violent war that will shake the foundations of his family, and lead to the rise of his youngest son, Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Vito is unforgettable, but Al Pacino as Michael impresses for his transformation from recently returned war hero to ruthless mafia boss. None of the supporting cast disappoint, with strong performances from Caan, Duvall, Shire, and Keaton. Memorable score by Nino Rota will produce earworms long after the movie is over.",positive
This movie was so sick it's just the epitamy of awsome.,positive
"Beautiful story by Mario Puzo. Adaptation from the novel is very smooth, and it gives the movie enough to work with, and to make famous, but it also gives one new ideas when reading the novel. The acting was beautiful bringing the Corleone Royal Family to life.",positive

"Great actings, a awesome plot and a kick-ass direction. A masterpiece from Copolla, a perfect introduction to this megalomaniac saga.",positive
"Revisited after 20 years and now on blu-ray, The Godfather really is as good as they say. I was reluctant to give Coppola's much heralded blockbuster five stars, but his direction is masterful (not showy, but perfect in its moods and mise en scene). Brando shows why he was considered such a talent and Pacino underplays everything (which is pretty amazing considering his subsequent rip-roaring style). Ah yes, this is a tale of an Italian-American crime family and their efforts to stay on top of the gangster hierarchy. Some say it is a metaphor for capitalism and it isn't too much of a stretch to see Michael Corleone's ruthless actions as akin to the hits carried out by Wall Street in hostile takeovers everyday. They make you an offer you can't refuse -- and it's business, not personal.",positive
"A great film, yet extremely overrated. Which leaves the viewer wondering 'what's so special?'",negative
"Honestly, this is one of the most overrated films of all time; however, it's a classic nonetheless. This is the film that got me into film, and I certainly appreciate it, to an extent.",positive
"Since I had read the book multiple times years ago, I hadn't made any effort to see the movie. Now I did and lo - it was pretty good.",positive
"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather.""",positive

"""The Godfather"" es un clasico del cine, plagado de momentos memorables y asombrosas actuaciones. A pesar de que Brando crea un personaje iconico, es Al Pacino como Michael Corleone quien hace de la cinta un retrato fascinante de como el poder corrompe. La película, basada en el best-seller de Mario Puzo, es larga pero nunca aburre ya que nos involucra en los detalles de la rivalidad entre diferentes familias y las tragicas consecuencias. Con un gran reparto y una brillante direccion de Francis Ford Coppola (quien ha participado en diversas producciones desastrosas que se han convertido en clásicos), ""The Godfather"" es una pelicula que no pierde su fascinacion a traves de los años.",positive

"Seriously. Is there ANYTHING of substance wrong with this movie? I would say, ""No"", except for the fact that it ends and you have to go back to reality after it is over.

"<i>''I understand. You found paradise in America. You had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. So you didn't need a friend like me. Now you come and say ""Don Corleone, give me justice."" But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me ""Godfather."" You come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder - for money.'' </i> The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son. <b>Marlon Brando</b>: Don Vito Corleone When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece <i>The Godfather</i> is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called <i>The Godfather</i> a candidate for the best film ever made and <i>""without a doubt, the best cast.""</i> He's not wrong. <div style=""width:600px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com/photos/13551308""><img src=""http://content6.flixster.com/photo/13/55/13/13551308_gal.jpg"" border=""0""/></a><div style=""text-align:center;font-size:10px;""></div></div> Based on a superbly written novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) whom has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favour of peace and prosperity without blood-shed and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world regarding the Mafia is exposed to a enthralled, gratuitous audience. <i>The Godfather</i> runs at being nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost to the letter, every scene bring the book to life. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, <i>The Godfather</i> never fails to keep our eyes focused upon the screen. <i>''I'll make him an offer he can't refuse...'' </i> We have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a film. Marlon Brando was great; that was an automatic victory. Although what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the combined supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, whom are at icon status today, were unknown before the release of this Picture. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers whom initially wanted to ban him from the role feel slightly embarrassed by their wrongly stormed assumptions. Al Pacino is undoubtedly the character in the film whom is shrouded by the curtain of irony. When we first see him, he's not implicated or involved in the family/Mafia business. He's passive, quiet, reflective, shy, with a clean record, and a returned home war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. The people surrounding him all deserve mentions as they all excel in their respective roles; Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, whom fits the exact image of how I pictured the character from the novel. There is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians whom become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lie in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well. What's beautiful about the film is in the regard <i>The Godfather</i> does not make attempts to glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this brutal setting, but never do we justify their consequences or actions with humanistic pardoning. When director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers effortlessly. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all shootings and killings in <i>The Godfather</i> look authentic and realistic as opposed to making them obvious simulated fakery. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and fool audiences into believing this is the real deal. <i>The Godfather</i> obviously was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered <b>3</b> Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until <i>Jaws</i>(1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. Thus now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>(1962), <i>Vertigo</i>(1958), and <i>Spartacus</i>(1960), <i>The Godfather</i> is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may live on and be remembered, in our collective minds for generations to come. <i>''It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men.''</i>",positive

"Sin lugar a dudas, una obra maestra que no solo es el mejor filme sobre la mafia (donde nunca mencionan la palabra) sino que es facilmente una de las mejores pelÃ­culas sobre la familia. Ya que a diferencia de otros filmes donde presentan familia disfuncionales, aquÃ­ los Corleone son una familia que se apoyan entre sÃ­. Usted nunca ve peleando a un Corleone con otro, ah! pero mÃ©tase con uno de ellos y tendrÃ¡ a los demÃ¡s saltando. Creo que es una de las claves de su Ã©xito donde la audiencia puede identificarse con las reacciones de los personajes donde tal vez no siempre sean las mÃ¡s sensatas o correctas, pero sÃ­ las mÃ¡s lÃ³gicas y reales. Un filme con tantas escenas memorables que creo que cada persona tiene la suya propia, en mi caso, mi escena favorita es cuando Michael llega al hospital y no hay nadie protegiendo a su padre, y tiene que ser Ã©l quien (con ayuda de una enfermera) quien mueva de habitaciÃ³n a su padre y protegerlo Ã©l solo, sin siquiera un arma para evitar que maten a su padre, y lo mejor es que su padre despierta y se da cuenta del apoyo de su hijo y suelta una lÃ¡grima, allÃ­ en ese momento, se define el respeto y uniÃ³n que tendrÃ¡n Don Vito y Michael, que llegarÃ¡ al punto de traspasar su poder a Ã©l y no cuestionar sus decisiones y reafirmar que ahora la familia la dirige Ã©l. No es coincidencia que Mario Puzo haya sido el guionista donde luego en otro memorable filme usara la misma fÃ³rmula del padre se vuelve el hijo, y el hijo en el padre. Brillantes actuaciones de Marlon Brando y Al Pacino, pero tambiÃ©n quiero rescatar a quien no siempre mencionan que es James Caan sobre quien recae la trama durante un gran tiempo de la historia mientras Don Vito (Brando) estÃ¡ hospitalizado y Michael (Pacino) quien todavÃ­a estaba en su proceso de ascenso. Y sin duda, la inmortal mÃºsica de Nino Rota que si bien le hicieron una injusticia en este filme al sacarlo de las nominaciones, fuÃ© rectificado en la segunda parte. Un filme que retrata sin reservas no solo las tribulaciones de una familia sino el punto de transiciÃ³n en la historia de Estados Unidos donde incluso el crimen organizado empieza a perder su ""inocencia"" por llamarlo asÃ­ al entrar en la ecuaciÃ³n el tentador elemento de las drogas. Este filme ofrece a la audiencia... una oferta que no puede rechazar.",positive
"This one is now in everyone's top 3 list, and influences many other movies, TV shows, and books about the subject of organized crime. Brando in the lead role has been named the most memorable character ever, and he certainly was great in the role, capturing the essence of the character in the book, written by the great Mario Puzo. The book was great, and so was the movie. A truly great cast, including Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Robert Duvall.

"One of the greatest films of all time. The performances are some of the best in cinema history. Everything about this movie is great and they pay real close attention to the story and the plot, not many films do that nowadays. Francis Ford Coppola has proved himself dearly as one of the best directors in Hollywood with this film.",positive
"One of the legendary piece of cinema ""The Godfather"" stands tall above all its competitors in the most elegant way . It redefines Mafia with perfect portrayals from Marlon Brando & Al Pacino . Such detailed lifestyle is what we see in this particular film with brilliant setting and amazing cinematography , it is a pure joy to journey through the life of Corleone . Its expertly directed with a beautiful underlying score from Nino Rota : all the elements that make anything associated with Godfather a legendary status",positive
Best movie...EVER!!!,positive

Great actors. A must see. If you like mafia movie this is one of the best.,positive
"[img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/icons/icon14.gif[/img] Outstanding in every possible manner, the feature that would be first in the cinema dictionary to be classed underneath masterpiece. There are certain films that are adored by almost everyone, films that have the honor of being called flawless, films named misunderstood cult classics, but then there's Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". Arguably one of the greatest achievements in American filmmaking. A powerfully acted, grippingly written, utterly overwhelming gem crafted with such skill that it is categorically and unconditionally flawless. I cannot cast enough praise for this film. Aside from merely delivering what we expect when we wish for a big screen experience. Including that of good performances, great scriptwriting and artful direction this delivers so much more. At the time of it's release no person expected it to be as good as it was. But The Godfather gave us all of the above and in addition to that defined a genre. It was the birthplace and remains to this day the high water mark for gangster drama/crime noir filmmaking. It's highly open to debate what the message of the saga is. I see at it as a truthful insight into how the gangster genre is endlessly and carelessly glamourised. That there is actually a lot of pain and heartbreak in the criminal underworld. I also think the film is a lecture on what can be personal as opposed to that what is actual business in the line of organised crime. But also a tale of love, hatred, truth and death. In addition to that, as a companion piece to my favourites, a better cast has never been assembled on screen before. Marlon Brando's most engrossing performance is undeniably showstopping. Al Pacino who plays the role of one of his sons constructs the character inside out. Changes him from a vastly respectable man, to an even more reputable godfather. The way I view it is simple. If a film can grip you so much that you actually manage to sympathise for a universally feared mafia crime lord what your having the pleasure of viewing must be really something and then some. The Godfather is just that, it delivers in every single department. It is quite easily one of the best films that ever graced motion pictures.",positive
I loved this flim very much I would give this movie five stars,positive
It's the Godfather!!! Come on!!! What else is there to say!?!?!,positive
1&2 together is the best movie of all time.,positive
The perfect fusion of art and mass entertainment.,positive
Best Movie Ever Made,positive
"Perfectly shot, well written, well acted. Classic.",positive
"The standout of Francis Ford Coppola's directorial career is also one for all its actors and American cinema overall, the film details 10 years in the life of the Corleone family and the exchange of power from Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in a magnificently fitting role) to his initially reluctant college-attending son Michael (Al Pacino) and the family's dealings and struggle to hold onto power in New York. With stunning cinematography and standout scenes (Hollywood bigshot Jack Woltz waking up with his stallion's severed head in the bed with him; Sonny being murdered in cold blood at a highway toll booth; and the murders of the other New York dons in the final minutes), a classic score, sure-handed direction and a plot that uses every minute of its three-hour running time to maximum use, The Godfather is a deserving modern classic that has rightly taken its place amongst the best films of all time.",positive
What can I say? One of the greats.,positive
"I can't believe people are giving it less stars because ""they read the book"". Reading the book doesn't change the fact that this film is freakin' fantastic.",positive

"This film is overrated. Not too much, though. I really don't see the point where people say that ""every scene is perfect"". It's just too much talking and it's very boring. I prefer Part II so bad. I know you might kill me for this, but hey, this is what reviews are for, to be honest about what you think about a movie.",negative
"All I can say, is that there is no wonder why this is an American classic",positive
i bless the godfather,positive
"The Godfather will always stand as one of the best mafia crime drama films out there. With a story line that draws you in, and acting that makes you grin with delight, The Godfather is a classic among classics whose screenplay and legacy has been known to influence many crime dramas after it. Done in 1972, which is exactly 40 years ago based on this review time (2012), the legacy of the Godfather lives on, many a time's phrases and lines from the movie are used by other films or people just to pass their message along. The screenplay of the movie too has been used in many other films, one I do remember is the movie Analysis This, where Billy Crystal had a dream of the death of De Niro (De niro was in Godfather II), in the same style as the attempted assassination of Vito Corleone. The Godfather is directed by Francis Ford Coppola (who also worked with Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now 1979) and produced by Albert S. Ruddy whom i remember is the man behind Cannonball Run 1 and 2. The movie is based on a 1969 book set between the mid 40s and 50s. The book was written by Mario Puzo and the name of the book is the same as the movie. The screenplay won an Oscar and it was adapted/done by Mario Puzo and Coppola. The film stars Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone the Don, the Godfather and the head of one of the five Mafia families in America. He has 3 sons and a daughter Santino (Sonny), Federico (Fredo), Michele (Michael) and Constanzia (Connie). The story, spanned the years 1945 to 1955, and the plot is about the rise of the new Don in the Corleone family. Sonny Corleone was suppose to head the family, but due to unforeseen circumstances Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) now has to take over from Vito. Michael was a war hero who lived outside of the family business, but when an attempt was made on Vito Corleone's life he had to join forces with his brother Sonny to put things back in shape for the Corleone family. Made on a budget of 6.5 Million dollars, the movie has grossed over 280 million in its run. Getting 9 nominations in the Academy Awards and it went home with Best Picture for Albert S. Ruddy, Best Actor for Marlon Brando and Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Ironically Pacino was not first considered for the role he was an unknown, he only got the role because Coppola threatened to quit if he wasn't given the part. If you haven't seen this masterpiece, then I don't know what you have been watching. www.lagsreviews.com",positive
"This film is often cited by many as one of the greatest films of all time. I certainly would not be one to argue because it has so many extraordinary aspects. You have Brando as the title character and a great cast of others who reveal the honor as well as the brutality of this lifestyle. However this film is not just about the violence. It is complex and fascinating in many other ways. Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall, with director Francis Ford Coppola, this is possibly one of the greatest films ever. It begins at a wedding in the 1940s as Don Vito Corrleone takes care of some ""business"" as head of the family. All too soon it becomes evident that the Don is loyal to his friends and ruthless to those in his way. His youngest son Michael returns from the war and wants nothing to do with the business but at the same time conflict blows up when the family does not back a heroin dealer. When the Don comes close to death Michael finally gets involved. After a series of events he becomes head of the family and soon proves how powerful he can be. Although this film has so much fan fare I did enjoy it a lot. Like I said before it is not just about the violence by any means. It is a period piece with an intriguing story and complex and interesting characters that truly reel you in.",positive
couldn't even sit through this movie such a bore!,negative
"A iconic film, and in its own right. It's a film that says we don't need people running round with guns, murdering everything they see. It's a film that is rich in character and in script, its gripping and a pure gangster movie and is ""The Godfather"" of all gangster films.",positive

A classic. Everyone should see this film.,positive
Perfect story. Brilliant director. Flawless cast. The recipe for an awe inspiring movie.,positive
"A tragic telling of a story about family and the conflicts that occur within it, Godfather is a classic among the classics in mafia movies. This film is a spiral of emotions that takes you from the heart of the mafia to the gutters of New York. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan own their roles, becoming each a different character than the last. This is a motion picture that not only became a masterpiece in its own right, but a standard for all those other films that even tried to challenge it. Godfather is beautifully directed, perfectly written, and spectacularly acted. Now, some may find this film slow at points, but I can't deduct points from this film, in regards to the slow parts, because they all happen for a reason and in the end the juice is worth the squeeze. This film is basically perfect! I'd give it a 98 out of 100, but since I can't, I'll go for five full stars. I recommend it to anyone who's in for a great mafia movie.",positive
What an awesome film - i'm not sure how I missed out on this for so long. A new favourite and an ultimate classic film - can't wait to watch the other two.,positive

Awesome that is about it just AWESOME!!!!!,positive
"I'm usually not one for long movies. Usually, when a movie goes over 2 hours, it can start to get tedious. Who want to watch a single movie for 3 or more hours? However, there are some movies that need to be 3 hours or longer because their stories just cannot fit the average movie length. The Godfather is one of those movies. Marlon Brando is the perfect fit as the initial Godfather especially in the opening dark scene. This movie especially uses its 3 hours wisely in slowly transforming Al Pacino's character who goes from serving in the military in World War II and not wanting to be involved in the mafia lifestyle (as well as his father not wanting him involved in it) to becoming the new Godfather. It's a shame Pacino didn't receive an Academy Award for this because it would have been properly earned.",positive
It really is an offer you can't refuse.,positive
Mortalmente bello. Oft parodied yet all powerful.,positive
"One of the greatest films ever made, plain and simple",positive
"The gold standard of gangster movies. There is a reason, and a good one at that, that this movie has stood the test of time.",positive
"If it's quotable it's memorable. If it's memorable then it's ultimately joyous, and that's what The Godfather is: joyously brilliant entertainment, filled with artistic vision and messages that more than overhaul.",positive
"Impeccably set, acted and so well constructed, there is a reason it is a classic. The Godfather is a great example of great filmmaking at its best and a starting point or peak for great acting legends: Pacino, Brando, Caan, Keaton and Duvall.",negative
One of my favorite movies of all time. The cast is exceptional & the story is moving. Always worth a watch.,positive

This film is just perfection.There is nothing else to say.,positive

completely over talked and overrated. but still pretty good,negative
"yawn. so overated. when u watch scarface, casino, goodfellas and all those brill mafia films the godfather becomes even more boring. there are good bits but 92% of it is pants",negative
If any movie deserves 5 stars it's this one.,positive
"I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie if I tried. It's all perfect, the pacing, the characters, the dramatic cinematography. It has aged like a fine wine.",positive
"'I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.' Like Tom Hanks said, by means of ""You've Got Mail"", Godfather has all the answers to LIFE that a man ever need",positive
With no doubt a masterpiece. Nobody should die without watching this movie.,positive
"I have nothing but respect for The Godfather's massive legacy and influence on film. It renewed the rules of gangster films and opened up the doors for many other significant crime films, brought Al Pacino to prominence and said a lot about family dynamics, the role of crime in American history and corruption. Quite simply, cinema would be much different today without it. But while its legacy is easy to praise, I can't say the same about the film itself. For someone who was completely blown away by Goodfellas and HBO's The Sopranos, The Godfather feels too long, stagnant, unenergetic and humorless when compared to them. The legendary performances by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall are praiseworthy, and there are many individual scenes - the horse head, the restaurant shooting, Michael's christening - that are unforgettable, but as a whole the film is too heavy, bloated and tedious. The Godfather is a one of those films you're not allowed to say anything negative about, but even after repeated viewings, it still just makes me sleepy.",negative
What can one say about this movie??? It's so brilliantly written n a classic. Not enough starts to rate this...,positive
the greatest movie of all time!,positive
One of the best movies ever! All of them !,positive
"Very well done, especially for being 40 years old. Glad I finally watched it",positive
"There's ""The Godfather"", and then there's everything else.",positive
"Probably one of the best, if not the best, films ever made. It's a strong gangster film that focuses more on the meaning of family and the ties that bind which makes it a unique masterpiece. Pacino is great coming into his own, Brando is masterful as the head of the Corleone family, and all the others (Caan, Duvall, Shire) play their roles with a confidence that is swift and evoking. It's spanning time of 3 hours almost seems to be not enough for this crime saga that is watchable over and over for me. I loved the plot, the vying of families in NY, the set pieces, the cinematography (scenes especially in which Pacino transforms into the new don and brando is in his dying state are epically captured) and above all the directing is top notch. This movie is one of my favorites and would definately be a great reccommendation to anyone looking for a great film that not only captures the essence of love, hate, violence, revenge, and non other, family...",positive
This film is the springboard for so many others that came after it. It is one of the most beloved films of all time.,positive
"To this day, not one movie of the Mafia genre has challenged what The Godfather is. With many classic elements, lines, scenes, acting and directing, The Godfather is simply the symbol for it's genre, and a very classic film you've got to see.",positive
"I understand why it gets the praise, but it's just not my kind of movie.",positive
This movie made me want to be a better man. and Italian,positive

"Marlon Brando interpreta a uno de los personajes mas grandes que ha dado la historia del cine, el guiÃ³n magnificamente hecho por puzzo y coppola bridan el tono perfecto de maestria",positive
"The Godfather is a great crime film, but I would not say that it's a perfect film. However, it is an engrossing drama about family and the mafia, and has a lot to offer in terms of storytelling and character development. It has definitely earned its status as a classic because it is a truly great crime film.",positive
"Ya know what, you guys? This is a good movie.",positive
i will make an offer he can't refuse. This is really mafia.,positive
This is one of the best movies of all time!,positive
perfect from start to finish,positive
"My equal favourite film of all time. The story is perfect, the acting hasn't dated after its release 40 years ago, and the direction is the best I've seen in any movie. The Godfather shows what life would be like as a gangster and if you had a loving family who are equally at risk as the head of the mafia. The Godfather is the godfather of crime movies. The only other one that comes close is Goodfellas which is arguably more fun than The Godfather, but not as epic. The Corleone's are the most relatable family in the crime genre. The look out for one another and protect their father, the head of the mafia, Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando. Marlon Brando gave us the best leading performance in a film. He is hard to understand at times with the weird way his character talks, but you can understand him most of the time. The power his character has onscreen is incredible. He steals the show and is well aware of it. A unique epic that does not depend on huge-scale effects at all but instead focuses on the story, the characters, the score and the drama. Flawless. A film that must be seen to understand the glory of The Godfather. This timeless classic gets a perfect score of 5/5.",positive
One of the most influential and best directed films ever made.,positive
Looooooooove this movie,positive
"It's the GODFATHER... What else can I say? Brilliant performances. Marlon Brando... Al Pacino... Robert Duvall... List goes on and on. It's an damn good movie of crime, loyalty, betrayal, and family. It's an interesting character study of the protagonist, Michael (Al Pacino), how he changes throughout the film from being a law-abiding citizen who avoids affiliations with his family's life of crime, to a cold gangster willing to protect it. The movie is also very quotable: ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli.""",positive
To watch before you die. A legend,positive
What can be said about the Godfather?,positive
"The story of family. Although filled with tired stereotypes, the story of the Corleone family boasts compelling performances by Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton... good grief who is not in this film. One of the best.",positive
"One of the most profound films, that was sure of itself and confident, that was ever made in the history of cinema.",positive
Wonderful classic. Brilliant.,positive

Greatest film of all time.",positive
It took me too long to see this. (Thanks Doug!),positive
a must see all 3 film well worth watchin,positive
Perhaps my favorite film.,positive
"I only have one minor problem with The Godfather and the my issue with this movie Is that I was never convinced that Al Pacino's character Michael Corleone became a bad person just like that, I never believed the transformation but that's my only problem. I still love the movie and it's a near masterpiece 9.7/10",positive
I can see why it's a classic. Great film!,positive

"Never too old to watch, and never too late to critique. It was forty years ago when a novel written by Mario Puzo became alive after being taken into the visionary hands of Francis Ford Coppola. In 1972, although negatively criticized for some of its violence, a crime-drama titled The Godfather became, what we now know as, one of the greatest poetic motion picture masterpieces of all times. Focusing mostly on the life of an Italian mobster's son, Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino), this fascinating work of art also enriches a plate of cinema food for the appetite in the Italian culture all while converging the business life with the value of family. As we sit back and enjoy, we are transcended back and forth through time with the great Marlon Brando and sharp Robert Deniro who both play the same character, Don Vito Corleone, about 30 years apart. With an all star cast already at play, the roster thickens with roles by a cocky James Caan, an over the top Taila Shire, a dazzling and gentle Diane Keaton, and a passive Robert Duvall; to name a few. I will forever give this ""gift to the film world"" a two-thumbs-up rating and advice anyone over the age of 13 to check out.",positive
**here I am watching the film for the nth time... and still I learn something new from this film... just bought a 'blu-ray' copy from quiapo for 50 bucks so I waytch it in a cleared image....nice to see Marlon Brando and Al Pacino doing the acting again... best trilogy ever made?? I think so...,positive

"Toda a mitologia e brilhantismo que envolve a famosa trilogia The Godfather inicia-se com a convocaÃ§Ã£o de um gÃªnio chamado Francis Ford Coppola ganhador do Oscar de melhor roteiro original em 1971 com o filme Patton. Apos trÃªs diretores se recusaram a gravar o filme Roger Evans chefe da Paramount Pictures na Ã (C)poca procurou entÃ£o Francis Coppola que demorou a fechar o acordo com a Paramount exigindo mudanÃ§as no roteiro que era uma adaptaÃ§Ã£o do livro de Mario Puzo. Depois de ajudar na adaptaÃ§Ã£o do roteiro Coppola partiu para escalaÃ§Ã£o do elenco, nos papeis principais estava o grande Marlon Brando que interpretou Vito Corleone e o pequeno que se tronou grande Al Pacino, no papel de Michael Corleone. Os papeis secundÃ¡rios ficaram com James Caan (Santino Corleone) Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen) Richard S. Castellano (Peter Clemenza) Diane Keaton (Kay Adams) Abe Vigoda (Salvatore Tessio) John Cazale (Frederico Corleone) Talia Shire (Constanzia Corleone).

"Amazing! The greatest American film ever made! The performances in this film are unmatched by any other. Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Marlon Brando collaborate on screen perfectly.

Francis Ford Coppolla creates a vivid world of family, money-making business and unfiltered realism. Most definitely my favorite movie ever!",positive

"""Best film ever"" seems to always creep into the wrong movies. However, when one chooses to use the phrase by referring to the success of this film, it is arguable, but also very acceptable.",positive
A classic I had never seen but was told I had to see it - I enjoyed it :). Didn't understand a lot of it but enjoyed it,positive
As the name suggests this is the definitive gangster film and as a surprise to the first time viewer a great film about family. Thus this film rises above the medium it was created on to-encompass how universal story is.,positive
An American classic.,positive
"Isn't this one of the greatest films there is? Absolutely brilliant. Just stunningly good cinema, with a towering performance from Marlon Brando. Everything about the film - from the scenery to the music and story - is utterly entrancing.",positive

"""The Godfather (1972)"" conta com um poderoso cast (Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan) e uma rodagem que conseguiu ter a capacidade de transformar aquilo que dava para uma série para um filme de três horas. Até à presente data este filme ergue-se sobre todos! 100% :D",positive
"There are very few movies you could truly do justice to when reviewing, The Godfather is one of them. How do you talk about a movie that's so well received, masterfully crafted, with a huge impact of cinema that everyone knows about? For of this review I decided to read the novel to help differentiate mine from the many written about this classic. The Godfather tells the well crafted story of an aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son. The movie as a whole is epic on scale in terms of storytelling, casting, and direction. The plot spans the course of several years showing in depth about organized crime families and their lifestyles. It shows us that these criminal have a code honor, a life-threatening lifestyle on a daily basis, and large amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. The plot alone would have guaranteed a perfect rating for demonstrating how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability. The cast and their performances as just as impressive. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The direction is flawless, there's not a dull moment in this masterpiece. The Godfather deserves the praise it get and will continue to receive for years to come. Now for the novel which many many fans of this classic seems to have know the existent of nor a majority have likely never bother to read it. Coming from a guy who read the novel let me tell you the movie is far superior in every way and don't waste your time on it. The novel focuses on Sonny hot-tempered older brother of Michael and, in the novel, has a massive dick which the novel reminds of over and over again. And his penis isn't just casually thrown in there -- it's violently thrust into every nook and cranny of the book over and over again, like a big, invasive, impossible-to-ignore. Frankly, that's better than any analogy we could come up with. Puzo never missed an opportunity to mention it in the least-mature terms possible (""Did you hear, Sonny's dick is so big that hookers charge him double! Did you know, Sonny's tool is so huge that his wife thanks God he's having affairs!""). And so on, what importance this serves in a story about family and power and corruption is a mystery. It's a complete mess of a novel that in no way should be read by the movie fans, it gears more towards sex and love than about crime and the risk of this lifestyle. By the end of the novel (which is surprisingly not about greed, a family of gangsters and the American Dream), Jules performs reconstructive surgery on Lucy's vagina to take it from ""ultra-freak-giant"" to ""standard-vagina-size"" which is directly from the novel. Don't read the source material, stick the movie which got it right. The Godfather lives up to it legendary reputations and set a standard for crime movies that won't ever be matched in the same level. I'll give even more towards Francis Ford Coppola who adapted the lackluster novel gave us a experience that truly best represents the criminal lifestyle. The Godfather is movie you must watch in order to understand why it's so beloved and consider a masterpiece in film-making.",positive
"A groundbreaking cinematic achievement made possible by both the drama of the story and the excellent performances of the amazing cast. Pacino is just incredible here, as is Brando. Repeat viewings only make me love this film even more. Outstanding.",positive
why people are dying like this in this movie???? this is ridicules just like the director hates them,negative
"Yes, but 2 is better.",positive
One of the best movies ever made!,positive
"Simply, An Acting Masterpiece.",positive
"I finally saw this! Yay! It is a burden off my movie-watching chest. So what did I think? It was very good. Extremely authentic feeling with all the family interaction, and the weddings that made you feel like a voyeur. When I first saw Don Corleone it was hard to take him seriously considering all the ribbing the character has taken over the years. I got used to him, though, and realized how great Marlon Brando was here. Really, everyone was great. Michael is such a sympathetic character. You know right from the beginning that there's no way he's going to be able to stay out of the family ""business"". Movies like this make me wonder how accurate they are in comparison to how things were for real. Of course, mobsters existed. Of course, they fought over territory and such. All the killing is hard to take, though. It just paints everything with a tinge of sadness. I end up feeling bad for these clueless men who think they have it all figured out. Great movie. I'll have to get part 2 now.",negative
Sorry but I was totally bored...,negative

"It is a masterful and flawless work fully deserving of it's immortal reputation.

Oh Yeah! Do not foorgettabout it!,positive
A must if you have 12 hours spare. The 3rd is not so good with some shocking 'acting' from director Francis Ford Coppola's daughter. The second is confusing as it goes back in time for a while. Part 1 is surely in my top ten though. Superb.,positive
Perfection. If you don't like this movie you should probably be shot....multiple times...from multiple toll booths,positive
"I took me a long time to understand why this film is so great, but it is. The performances are so powerful you forget it's a movie.",positive
"If this isn't the greatest film ever made, then it's certainly unquestionably one of them and if you don't think so objectively then you are a certified grade A dumb bastard. Honestly. But don't be offended by that because it took me 30 years to watch this movie and it was more than I expected it to be. It's about family and blood ties, with Michael being forced to step up and take the Corleone family reigns after a series of violent attacks leave him no choice. The family is tight circles like these and this gives you a great example of that.",positive
third one is not as good. but still windowing,positive

"What you can learn from this Movie: ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli""",positive
What can I say but this is a movie no one could ever refuse.,positive
"There are a very few movies that seem to enchant you everytime you see them. After my fifth viewing, I am still amazed at the direction, acting, story, screenplay, photography and what not. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is struggling to keep peace between the five Italian American Mafia families after Sollozzo (Al Lettierri) plans to bring in the narcotics. The denial to indulge in narcotics by Don Corleone is followed by an attack on his life and subsequently an attack on his whole family as he finally sees his family crumble. His son Michael (Al Pacino) joins the family and mends things to keep the family's honor from crumbling. There is a certain magnificence that shines in every part of the movie. The family, the honor, the crime, the business and the politics. The movie slowly starts out detailing every small detail, gradually expanding in between, to finally end in an epic climax. Three hours of magnanimous movie experience.",positive
"One to watch, but not for the impatient.",positive
"Since the 1972 Academy Awards or 1973 whatever, this has been called as one of the greatest movies of all time and aclaimed as the definitive one. It took me 1 year to finally get to see this and the whole trilogy because I bought the complete saga box. And what's the result? It's undoubtadly one of the most well developed dramas of all time, it's like a play with sparkles coming from every single aspect, from minute one to the final scene. Cinematography it's clearly one of the greatest, it's glamorous and full of Coppola's genious mind. The performances and cast can't be beaten as Mr. Kubrick said, and the adapted screenplay it's simple fantastic thanks also to Mario Puzo who put his artistic view of his own novel into the screen. To end, just need to say that this is completely a must see for everyone and don't dislike it just becuase people talk so much about it.",positive
"What more can be said about this film? Just about everything that can be said has already been stated. Nonetheless, ""The Godfather"" has a profound influence in cinematic history, and deserves all of the praise it will get and has gotten. Rest of review here: http://movie-blogger.com/movie-review/jones-review-godfather",positive
My favourite movie of all time! Marlon Brando definitely deserved the oscar he won which was Best Actor at the 45th Academy Awards in 1973 as his performance as Don Corleone.,positive
Brandos role is very small if you think about it... but his performance was all i could remember after watching the movie... Recommended to all..,positive
best movie ever made,positive
"Really, this film is outside of my interest level. I don't want to spend three hours with people I wouldn't trust my rear with. But in a contradictory sense, Marlon Brando's character had a weird sense of honor which completely contradicted his rep as a mobster. His character, Vito Corleone was the kind of guy you felt comfortable around, as long as you were on his good side. Marlon Brando was easily my favorite part of this. He put in a strange sense of emotion in the form of an easy-going, smooth talking family man that doesn't care about the outside world as long as it doesn't invoke his favorite aspect of life: family. Michael, on the other hand, just became freakin' psychotic. I wouldn't want to spend 1 nanosecond with the new scumbag. That film offered many surprises through the twists, acting, camera, whoa. The only flaws I could think of were the length (a lot of the scenery was partially filler) and the Italian needed subtitles. Other than that, the dialogue was perfect and the score was good. I give it a 98. It's not perfect, but I can understand its status.",positive
I'll make you a deal you can't refuse. WATCH THE GODFATHER!,positive
"""Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. "" - Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino)",positive

"American critic Leonard Moltin not without wit defined as follows very appearance of March 15, 1972 the movie ""The Godfather"", ""answer the 70's to"" Gone With the Wind. "" It would seem that the connection between these paintings but the resounding success of the audience? But Francis Ford Coppola, who was then only 32 years old, entered the history of American cinema as a director, who saw in the story of a mafia can create not just another gangster tapes, and this epic in the form of a family saga. Only instead of a war between the North and the South was in the ""Godfather"" in the center of the story brutal, bloody fight bandit clans in New York in 1945. However, the Mafia Don Corleone - is, above all, the family at the family and spiritual significance, where blood ties are intertwined, national - italoamerikanskie - communication, but also gang ""brotherhood."" The head of the clan is the godfather to all - both literal and figurative sense. Perhaps today the bold striping scenes of carnage and intimate family scenes of weddings, baptisms, marital discord seem somewhat straightforward. At the beginning of the 70's this parallel, we can say, ""griffitovsky"" installation worked perfectly. Coppola family saga set forth in the language of a dynamic, changing the stress development, as if in a kaleidoscope of seemingly disparate events, as in the end of ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""Intolerance."" Nearly three-hour movie based on a detailed and sometimes verbose novel by Mario Puzo impression unfolding cool gangster thriller in which nothing is superfluous and every detail is firmly tied to the plot. The painting, which cost only $ 6 million, enjoyed great success, immediately surpassing the budget more than 22 times. And now the results rolled, restated for inflation and changes in ticket prices, took a respectable 21th place in the history of American cinema. It is true that the ""Oscar"" was awarded to the film as a whole, adapted screenplay Coppola and Puzo, as well as outstanding actor Marlon Brando, who created a lasting image of the patriarch of the family and gang organization, then repeatedly parodied only on the role of external signs (muffled, husky voice; sudden savage grin playing with grandchildren elder). A true successor to Brando, who, by the way, refused to ""Oscar"" is not on creative reasons, was not only the story, but also the highest level of the game and inner reflection of changes in the character of a young singer Al Pacino. He just played a psychologically Michael Corleone, turned from an idealistic young boy in cold blood of a dictator who has deprived his father's lovely manners Don Vito. And with even more ruthlessness towards his character the actor played the role of Michael in the second part, where it has already become the main. But once again left without a well-deserved ""Oscar"" - ironically, the Academy Award Â (R) was again intended to anyone who played Don Vito Corleone, only in youth, and that the winner was Robert De Niro.",positive
"A classic movie, it can get only 5 stars and nothing else. Anyway, I read the book by Mario Puzo and I found it a little better than the flick. Probably just because the movie was cut into 3, and even some scenes were added. Anyway, the best of the best.",positive
"One of the most outstanding things about this perfect piece of cinema is Al Pacino's performance as Michael, who slowly (and very believably) morphs from boy scout to ruthless mob boss. Amazing.",positive
"It's considered a classic because it was cynically designed to be a classic; it knows the the secrets of tension and payoff, it hooks the idiots with some random moaning broad getting boned in the first few minutes, and enough money was pumped into it that it looks like a painting in motion. You got breasts and glamourized gangster machismo for the men, and scenic rural Italy for the women. It would be obvious how paper-thin and sadly calculated it all really is if the performances didn't propel it into something approaching three-dimensionality.",negative
The best Godfather movie I think.,positive
good movie but i perfer number 2,negative
"MARLON BRANDO IS THE GREATEST ACTOR EVER, the whole cast does such an amazing job the whole cast deserves an oscar and fancis ford coppala is a genuis.",positive
"It hasn't dated a bit, and the performances of Brando, Pacino, and Caan are sensational. This movie feels like 90 minutes even though it goes on for 3 hours.",positive
What can I say except Don Corleone i salute you,positive
"Truly a classic film! Marlon's character was larger than life. So many legendary quotes and concepts come from this movie, acting, screenplay, directing, music all great. A must see for TRUE movie goers.",positive
"Not really my thing, but I watched it because it's one of those films everyone thinks you're a bit weird if you haven't seen. And yeah, it's undeniably a really good film - but I wouldn't rush to watch it again.",positive
One word: Masterpiece,positive
51 years of filmgoing and still on my Top 5.,positive

The Classic of All Times!!!,positive

Goes to the full extent of being a masterpiece.,positive
One of the best movies of all time. A classic.,positive
A masterpiece in epic storytelling,positive
"Who doesn't like this movie. This movie is a classic. Marlon performance as Don Vito couldn't have been done any better. The tone of the film just makes it even better. Al Pacino, of course, did great as Michael. This film just had everything executed correctly. The action, the drama, the mood, just everything was great.",positive
"It's absolutely nowhere near my favorites list, but still, I can't deny a true masterpiece.",positive
"You honestly can't fault it even after 40 years. Watched last night for only the second time and it's a masterpiece of characterisation, violent action, drama and romance. Visually stunning, immaculately and lovingly crafted, it is simply, perfect.",positive
"It took a while to get going, but by the monumental second half and once I was able to understand the plot and find my way around the many characters, this film really blew me away. I truly enjoyed it the first time around, but my enjoyment of the film will probably triple on a second viewing.",positive
"Brilliant, thrilling, and absolutely remarkable in every possible way, The Godfather serves as one of the greatest cinematic achievements in the history of film!!!",positive
The best Gangster Movie of all time.,positive
"What can be said about the godfather that you have not already heard. It is the true example of a masterpiece. If you have never seen this film, then you don't know good cinema and should be banished from the earth. ~ Average Movie Guy",positive
"Easily the best movie I've ever seen. A movie fill to the brim with beautifully written, directed and acted scenes, and a flawless performance from one of Hollywood's greatest actors, Marlon Brando.This is one of the only movies I would abandon my, ""You have the right to your own opinion"" philosophy over, along with Citizen Kane and One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest.",positive
"It was too slow for me, but apart from that it's pretty brilliant.",positive
"Definitely the best movie of all time, I don't know how it doesn't rank higher.",positive
"The magnifico mafioso masterpiece that started it all. It may seem over-hyped, but this one really does live up to the hype. With that, it's an essential movie for the film enthusiast and you cannot say you've seen films less you've also seen this film- it's just not an option.",positive
"Pacino, Brando, canolli's, excellence.",positive
"Timeless! This film introduces you to the world of the Corleone crime family, and sets up one of the best sequels of all time.",positive
Arguably the greatest movie of all time. One of Hollywoods greatest commercial successes it made benchmarks for american ciniema and made hollywood what it is and what it should always be,positive
Transcends American cinema,positive
"I don't care what people say about movies today and how mob movies lack originality, etc. This was THE mob movie that made other mob movies lack originality. This is the best mob movie, and one of the best overall movies, of all time. There is only one movie in history that tops this for me, and though I may get some hate for saying this, it's ""Inception"". But this movie, is an absolute must see, and a great movie at that.",positive
"After the twenty-fifth view, it still isn't old.",positive
"Simply terrible. I reluctantly watched this film for the first time yesterday, only did so because everyone always said it was so great. I feel like I was cheated out of three hours of my life. The plot was very predictable, the dialogue was droll at best, the movie is packed with stars I love at their worst. What offends me most of all, is that Brando was hailed for this role when he should have been laughed out of the academy...him and his ridiculous ""Vito"" mush mouth! The only good thing to say about this film is that it was somewhat better than the two abortion sequels that follow it. Being a fan of mafia films like Goodfellas and Scarface, I would suggest this film is out dated and out of touch in the light of true acting caliber, such as Jack Nicholson's role in The Departed. Seriously...don't waste your time unless you like feeble minded dribble.",negative
"""Make your child a masculin child"". A quote from such a classic gangster epic I will never forget.",positive
"What can be said about this epic crime drama that has not already been echoed multiple times by fans and critics alike? The Godfather is not only the ultimate gangster film, it is a masterpiece of modern cinema. As it tells the story of the Corleone family and the tragedies they endure as they rule the criminal underworld with mafia justice, The Godfather instantly becomes a classic of epic proportions. Featuring masterful directing by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and Marlon Brando in his greatest and most iconic role as Don Vito Corleone, the film is also accompanied by absolutely remarkable performances from Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. The dramatic use of lighting is reminiscent of Caravaggio, the soundtrack is stirring, and the dialogue flows perfectly from the mouths of history's greatest screen actors. Failure to embrace the artistic integrity of this film is nothing short of cinematic blasphemy.",positive
"In this day and age, it's nearly impossible to go into ""The Godfather"" without expecting greatness. It's one of the most respected and influential films of all time, and rarely do you hear a negative comment made against it. I'll say this: for a film made in 1971, it looks remarkable. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of brilliant. There is so much effort put into each shot that, at times, it's more interesting to just observe the images rather than listen to them. Of course, Marlon Brando's widely-imitated Vito Corleone is a fabulous performance that never fails at being amusing, and there are other great players as well, such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan (who just about steals every scene that he's in). I respect ""The Godfather"" for the impact that it has had on cinema, and even though I don't quite like it as much as everyone else seems to, you won't get a negative comment out of me.",positive
"Still consider this the best movie of all time that I have ever watched. Greatly written, awesome direction by Mr. Coppola, and amazing soundtrack",positive
One of the greatest films ever made a cinematic masterpiece it realy is the cast marlon brando is spectacular as vitto corleone one of the greatest characters ever put in film history Al pacino as michael wow is pacino good he starts off ashamed of his family twords the end he becomes more ruthless than any of them James Caan as sunny was also great to be honest he gives the best performance in the film but thats just me talia shire is good as the bride diane keaton as kay is short but sweet richard castenello was also good and symoethetic robert duvall is great as the friend this movie is awsome flawless and is one of the greates films ever made deffinetley a 10/10,positive
My favorite movie of all time!,positive
"So, the only thing crazier than taking 3 decades to watch a Rambo is the 4 it took to finally sit down and watch The Godfather. Obviously, knowing much of the story and ""omg ""moments, the impact of really experiencing it is lost; however, I'm glad I got to see it if for nothing else than viewing so many legends as ""youngsters."" Personally, I thought it was a little long and I struggled at times to stay with it. Nonetheless, it most certainly deserves its status as a classic; it's definitely the standard of the genre. While I'm sure it deserves 5 stars, it plays for me as more of a 3 1/2... I doubt I'll ever watch it again from beginning to end... but I'll round up because it has it's place -deservedly- in cinematic history.",positive
Cinematic brilliance. That's it.,positive

"The Godfather might be the best movie I've ever seen. The Journey of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from a free thinker and a WW II Hero to the new Godfather after his father, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the key plot of the movie. Everyone's acting is amazing and powerful but Brando's performance is so good that its just historical . Thanks to Francis Ford Coppola for such an amazing movie here. When someone offers us to watch The Godfather, we simply can't refuse...",positive

This will always be a classic.,positive
It's only flaw is in the scene where James Caan is messing up Carlo and one of the punches he throws CLEARLY goes no where near Carlo's head. 10/10.,positive
"Marlon Brando's performance is what made this film for me, along with many really good lines of dialogue and the darkness of many of the scenes. The scene on the porch between Brando & Pacino was another highlight, but most of all Brando's performance. I feel this is mainly due to the character he plays, because who doesn't want to be that guy, the respect he gets and his cool delivery of every line and his suave gentlemanly way of acting. However apart from this it isn't really all it's cracked up to be. Shun me if you want for saying but i was not really impressed by Pacino. Especially after seeing him in Scent Of A Woman where he gives one of my favorite movie performances. Also i feel it was a bit of a let down for me because i saw Apocalypse Now recently and Rumble Fish further in the past, two films that impressed me greatly. However this film still deserves much merit, despite a slight sink at the end the plot was very good, interesting to watch play out and intense at times. Many of the characters made you feel for them and take their side. However it just wasn't the crazy masterpiece it's cracked up to be. I've seen better films in the last 24 hours. (i.e Sunset Boulevard) Had an awesome soundtrack by the way.",positive
"Easily an entry for the ""greatest films ever made"" debate amongst your friends. If you haven't seen this movie, go to netflix and order it right now.",positive
An absolute masterpiece. The story is told brilliantly and the performances are outstanding. Don Corleone's character has so many dimensions and Brando truly perfected them all. An epic film that needs to be watched at least three times!,positive

"4.75/5. The one thing's that always bothered me is the main character's quick transition from soldier to villain. Other than that, it's done too well.",positive
"A work of intense concentration and attention to detail, 'The Godfather' is a beautiful example of when ensemble acting really works. The Godfather comes together well, but upon first seeing it I didn't feel it was as special as its reputation suggests. The far-superior Part II both expands on and validates the first one, and together they form one of the greatest movies ever made. Apart? Very, very good films. If I were ranking the two films together, they would be an easy 100%. As it is, 80%.",positive
"Talking about a classic. Although some may say it's a bit too ling, The Godfather is in perfect shape through the whole screening time, giving a detailed account of America's crime world. Changed the cinema forever.",positive
I will jump on the bandwagon of 5 star reviews and pretend like I understand this film. All I know is that it was great to watch and it was an emotional roller-coaster with superb acting.,positive
Hands down one of the greatest films of all time. Marlon Brando is brilliant.,positive
Coppola brings Mario Puzo's already great book to soaring heights. Brando gets his tour de force.,positive
One of the greatest movies ever produced!,positive
The best movie ever in Hollywood.Amen....,positive
It surprises me as to how anyone cannot like this movie.,positive
"When I first watched the godfather, I was 12, and I didn't understand it very well. Each time you watch it, it makes you feel differently.",positive
"The performance of Don Corleone was impecable. It seemed to me that some scenes - for today's standards - were a bit stretched with too much unnecessary detail, thus increasing the duration of the movie without helping the evolution of the plot. Nonetheless, it was a splendid example of the gangster genre and a must see for all cinema fans.",positive
"The Godfather is a masterpiece, is one of the best films that may have been done in the hole marketer such as Hollywood, no film could be compared to this majestic masterpiece of cinema.",positive
It IS The Godfather. Like come on.,positive
"Epic gang-story, long, but very deep. This is ""War and Pease"" of cinema. Must see.",positive
"I thought this was long and fairly boring, saved only by good performance from Marlon Brando.",negative
"If you haven't, you need to see this movie.",positive
"Watched the first three films in my US American History course. Of all the things we could've viewed, this was THE BEST! Kept my attention. Would watch again.",positive
BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
I dare you to say something bad about this movie.,positive
The Godfather is so famous that you don't need to hear my opinion. I'll just let you know that the contrast between the baptism and the murder was superb.,positive
Great classic. Not quite my style though. If it was I would have liked it even more. If I was into Mob movies it would have been the best movie ever.,positive
Compleeeeete perfection,positive
"Hits the bull's eye on every aspect of filmmaking and sits as a touchstone for film making not only in the genre but also for the filmmaking as a whole. Has stood the test of time and will ,forever.",positive
cinematic perfection,positive
If you have questions and you cant get the solution. So watch this movie. Don Corleone will help you.,positive
This Film Was Roger Ebert's And Gene Siskel's Best Film Of 1972 On Their Best Of 1972 Lists.,positive
"Showing no flaws, The Godfather took on a different role of what is known as a gangster movie. It revealed to the world the true nature of Mafia families. An impeccable Hollywood success, The Godfather assures a new way of film making.",positive
"The ultimate movie. I form first impressions of people I meet based on whether they've seen this or not, or iked it or not. It's tht important of a film.",positive
THE BEST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.,positive
Even though it's really long I liked it. It's very slow paced,positive
Everything fron that beautiful opening wedding scene to the tense and atmospheric restaurant scene is flawless!,positive
When it comes to family stories...this is number 1.,positive
A truly legendary film.,positive
its a good mafia movie,positive
"Such a whack movie, I gave blowies allll throughout dis movie. Where was Diane Keaton (herooo)",negative
The English language does not contain words good enough to describe this movie.,positive
The best gangster movie ever made.,positive
Great movie!! Watching it.,positive
Classic gangster movie. Al Pacino is great!,negative
"""The Godfather"" es una de esas pocas pelÃ­Â­culas en donde no tienes que explicar su magnificencia, pulcritud y excelencia. Nada mÃ¡s que decir.",positive
"I am 8 years old I have the movie, the book, and the game. I have to say this is the best movie of all time. Let's remember. I am 8 years old",positive
This is one of those movies where EVERY scene is important. It's single-handedly the GREATEST movie EVER!,positive
Brando. Pacino. How could it get any better?,positive
"The Godfather is a true American landmark in movie history, from its wonderful direction and creative writing from the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo to its chrasmatic performances from the one of the greats Oscar Winner Marlon Brando and the legendary Oscar Nomiee Al Pacino who deliever the most meomarable performances of both their careers. Overall The Godfather has a collection of brillance and outstanding creative work that pave the way for other great gangster films to open as well, but The Godfather is not only one of the greatist gangster films of all time, but one of the greatest American films of all time as well.",positive
No words could describe this movie. Arguably the best movie ever made.,positive
"A CLASSIC in EVERY definition of the word. Not only an All-Star Cast. But a great Story, Turning points, drama. Perfect for Anyone.",positive
Power Packed Movie !!,positive
"Utterly brilliant. Coppola and Pacino deliver a spectacular film on the mafia, and how the crime culture can corrupt even the most resistant of souls.",positive
Beautiful in every way!,positive
"The greatest American film ever made! The acting is yet to be topped by any other film, the drama is kinetic and compelling, the score is epic, and the directing is quite possibly the best of all time. This is my favorite film ever! It's just as good the 50th time as it is the 1st!",positive
"Watched the American crime epic 'The Godfather'. Though some minute flaws could be found in the editing, dubbing and screenplay parts, but it is understandable because it was made during the 70's. Still, the movie was gripping, original and awesome. Credits goes to Marlon Brando for playing the title character and the ever-promising actor, Al Pacino. He reminds me so much of Kamal Hassan in the movie. In short, it is a must-watch!",positive
"The perfect movie, like a great novel.",positive
Incredible. Amazing storytelling and stellar cast. Mind-blowing. I don't know what more to say.,positive
"I didn't like it. That sounds absurd to say. I disliked ""The Godfather."" Well, not really disliked. But I...didn't...like it. It just didn't grab me. Yes, the acting and cinematography were all stunning. But I can't help but get detracted by the highly romanticized, fictional portrayal of the mob. This movie franchise singlehandedly created the image of the mafia being an organization of honor, respect, and utmost classiness. Which it was not. And never will be. I love mafia stuff, such as Goodfellas, The Sopranos, Mean Streets, whatever. But...Godfather...nope. It's just too classic for me. That may sound pretentious and hipstery, but I assure you, it is. I don't like this movie because I don't. That is that.",negative
"Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's iconic best seller takes a sublime concept, such as the gangster-mob take, creating an identity to its whole background and conceiving an alternative way of narrating an epic tale in which the familiarities of good and evil goes further, delivering memorable characters, amazing performances and direction, superb progression and a romanticized style to the crime genre, ending in a timeless-classic-perfect film.",positive
"This movie isn't your average mafia movie. It's the romanticizing of the concept of the Italian mafia, nothing was ever done like this before. It's really an amazing movie. Everything about it is perfect.",positive
The only mob movie I can watch over and over again.,positive
"Simplement un des meilleurs films jamais rÃ (C)alisÃ (C), si ce n'est pas le meilleur!",positive
and now to watch part 2,positive
This movie is easily one of the best I've ever seen. It is possibly one of the better book-to-screen translations ever done and it is anchored by solid performances all around.,positive
"Outside of the fantastic acting from all the top cast ( Pacino, Caan, Brando, Duvall ) Pacing and story where all good. But it was not enough for me to believe the hype of best movie ever, but I can understand some feeling that way. I really feel if it had been slightly shorter that it would have been stronger at the end.",positive
First time i've watched it all the way through... I did it with Sicilian wine and sambuca... I recommend everyone does it immediately.,positive
One of my favorite movies!,positive
"No Mafia film has ever come close to Puzo's The Godfather, and none ever will.",positive
"A wedding. A horse's head. A gun in a restaurant toilet. Sicily. Another wedding. A car bomb. A toll-booth. An Orange peel. A baptism and a closed door. Seriously, is there anuyhing else that needs to be said. The Godfather is easily one of the greatest films ever made.",positive
This is of course a classic within the gangster genre.,positive
"The hype and legend that revolves around this movie made me hesitate on seeing it. I did not wish to set my stardards so high that they would fall short. After finally watching it, I completely could have set the bar as high as I wanted and I still would have been satisfied. The way it was all pieced together has left me rethinking it over and over and noticing many of the major plot points and how they simple paint a far larger picture than you see at first glance. The acting is something that has stood the test of time and frankly I feel the standard set by this movie is rarely reached by films these days. It is a classic for a reason and my simple words do not do it true justice.",positive
Worth watching if only to see Marlon Brando deliver one of the most powerful and memorable performances of his career.,positive
"Even 40 years later it's still one of the best movies ever made! There would be no ""Casino"", ""Good Fellas"", ""The Departed""...none of those films if it weren't for the original gangster film, ""The Godfather"".",positive
A phenomenal masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola!,positive
"Generally regarding as the best movie ever, this movie is a gem with a superb cast, great story, and outstanding acting. The movie portraits the Corleone family and it's rise, fall, and return to glory. This and its sequel are what are great about cinema---a movie you can watch and lose yourself in---one of the best!",positive
Loved this one aswell.,positive
The Godfather. No other words needed.,positive
You don't need to hear it from me to know it's good.,positive
A fantastically well made movie,positive
Great movie in all aspects ......i really enjoyed every second in this movie.....Amazing job from all the cast,positive
A timeless American masterpiece classic,positive
Loved it classic movie.,positive
"Great story, great cast, great director, great scripts, great everything! You can't go wrong with this cinema classic!",positive
"I chose to review this as a chunk rather than singular movies since I saw them in a one week period so the end and start of each one is kind of a blur. Anyway, these are some of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The 1st and 2nd I'll discuss first. Well, you know, they are extremely good. True epics that sprawl decades of fantastic story lines. Very enthralling, The Godfather part 1 and 2 are marvels of cinema. I don't want to sit here drooling over them, although I could, so I'll keep this shorter than I'd like. Undeniable classics that boast some of the greatest acting ever seen in the theaters and some of the greatest, most realistic writing as well. Realism is a word that seems to pop up in my head whenever I think about them. A constant sense of actual darkness and stress hangs over the films lush and beautiful set designs that is rare in movies back then and nowadays. The atmosphere is also stunning; fascinatingly haunting and dangerous.",positive
Make him a movie he can not refuse...,positive
"The Godfather is the pinnacle of what Hollywood is capable of and an example of the fine art that goes into movie-making. This film is considered to have one of the best if not the best, screenplays ever written and the cast is by far the most memorable of the century it premiered in. The Godfather is compelling as both a drama and crime thriller and set the expectations for character development in cinema from thereon out. As a character study, the film functions to follow Michael Corleone's rise to the head of power in his family and becoming a man in the gritty, cynical world that he lives in. Brando's performance only escalates the awe of the movie as it is his best remembered, and possibly most cherished. The Godfather (as stated above by the website) was a HUGE commercial and critical success and is still triumphant in showing how a perfect movie is to be made.",positive
"It could have been slimmed down, but overall a great epic.",positive
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse...,positive
Classic movie where everybody want to be a gangster after watching this.,positive
What can u say? Fantastic,positive
I need to rewatch this but it was interesting.,positive
Amazing story. Great cast and a tale to watch over and over and over again,positive
THE man movie of all time,positive
"even though film is long,you only realise it after you finish watching it.The barrage of characters is masterfully managed.All actors do their bit.Of course,you only remember Vito Carleone and Michael Carleone.Brando & Pacino truly shine in their roles A film worthy of its stature in world cinema.",positive
"it started it all off i fink this is probs da best ov da 3. it introduces the 5 familys then totaly destroys 4 ov em. ""Don Vito Corleone the 1st Godfather ov the Corleone crime family in this movie the Corleone control is strong bt there is still many ppl hu want them gone n they nearly succed but the new god father Don Michael Corleone is 2 smart 4 the other familys he plays them all into his own trap leavein him n the family 2 pick up all the old familys rackets. every1 wud have bn happy is it ended here because it was a real ride bt as we kno it doesnt.",positive
It's legendary for a reason!!!,positive
"This movie made me goosebumps, don't know why but it has all the emotions, love, family, crime, drama, suspense and actions. Whew..definitely one of the epic made story for movie. This movie really stood out.",positive
Need I say much about this movie that most people already know. Great movie that is the standard bearer for gangster/mob movies in the future.,positive
Extraordinarily crafted and explores the horror and true side of the mafia without the glamour and excessive power. One of the finest films ever made and spawning one of the greatest actors of all time Al Pacino. 5/5,positive
Absolutely flawless!,positive
"Another gangster classic! Brando delivers his best performance! The film that started Pacino's rise to fame! Without a doubt, The Godfather is the landmark of gangster films!",positive
One of - if not - the greatest movies of all time.,positive
"Coppola made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed. The Corleone family may be the mid-twentieth century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. Coppola put the mafia on the map, leaving filmgoers in love with criminal subculture. Lets talk a about the Master, Marlin Brando performance is justly famous and often imitated. Brando embodies the character so convincingly that at times we are not thinking of acting at all. Masterpiece.",positive
ClÃ¡sico sin paliativos. Obra maestraÂ¡Â¡Â¡,positive
Best movie i've ever seen!,positive
Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. Marlon Brando is amazing and so is Al Pacino and the whole cast in general. Viewed by many as the best Gangster film ever made and I believe it earns the title. Its a cinematic masterpiece all around. Its hard for a person from my generation to really judge the film since it came out in 1972 but I can appreciate every minute of it. Bravo!,positive
"In the words of Lois Griffin: ""It's so good. It's like the perfect movie.""",positive
Whenever a film disappoints you then simply pop this in the dvd player and watch the last 20 minutes. Brilliant.,positive
The greatest movie of all time.,positive
"I know it's a guy movie, but I can see it over and over again.",positive
"This movie has all the marks of a great film â"" Superb acting, dialogue, soundtrack and flow. The lack of any strong or interesting female characters is disappointing, but ultimately doesnâ(TM)t take away from its overall look and feel. Michaelâ(TM)s transformation is extremely compelling.",positive
"Very much ahead of its time. Perhaps timeless. Brilliant acting, music and cinematography. An gangster epic and a fantastic piece of cinema.",positive
"I know this movie has become an emblem of American pop culture, but I finally saw it recently and now understand why it has been so influential. It's a great film and story, excellent cast, beautiful cinematography and music. Three hours is a long time, but I lost track of the time when I got sucked into the story. I'm not going to lie, some parts are cheesy, but it's still a great movie.",positive
Um dos filmes mais perfeitos.,positive
"can't say anything that hasn't already been said, but i do like part II better for its parallel storyline",positive
"""The Godfather."" From the Urban Dictionary: Usually used to refer to the head of an Sicilian crime family/organization (Mafia). Being someone's Godfather was a great honor in Sicilian culture, and he was expected to help in the upbringing of the baptized child, almost like a third parent. The head of a criminal organization would look over all it's members in the same way, while he might not be related to any of them. The term Godfather didn't really catch on until the movie(s) were released. The Godfather settled all disputes within the family. Francis Ford Coppola's ''""The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil"" wrote Roger Ebert. The film certainly devotes much of its time attempting to gain our sympathy for its corrupt characters, and for most the part succeeds in doing so. It opens with the head of the Corleone Family Mafia Don Vito (Marlon Brando) taking a request from a man who wants The Godfather's help in avenging the brutal attack on his daughter. Brando gently pets and plays with a cat as he listens to the request. But he is no saint. As explained by Michael (Al Pacino) in an early scene with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton). One reason we sympathize with them so much is the fact that as a family, they look after one another (At least in the first film). And they will each stop at nothing to take out acts of revenge against those that do wrong by them or any of their loved ones. For instance: Look at the scene where Sonny (James Caan) discovers that his sister Connie (Talia Shire) has been abused by her husband. I think scenes such as these as well the scene showing the urgency of the family members to protect their father when his life is at stake. These scenes play with our emotions. They make us relate to people whom we really don't want to relate to. It shows us how nuanced the discussion of who classifies as evil and who does not truly is. Michael Corleone is the key character of all three films. We first see him in uniform, at his sister's wedding. Then as events play out, such as the attempted murder of his father, and a possible mob-war, Michael's instinct to help his family kicks in and out weighs his morals. We begin to see him morph from a decent man to a corrupt one who ends up being worse than his father. Pacino's gives a flawless performance as Michael. Notice the look in his eyes during the most important moment of his transformation when he kills for the first time. All the men in the ""Godfather"" have an unconditional love and sense of loyalty to their family. Which sounds nice, but can lead to misery if you have the wrong family.",positive
It's the Godfather! There's nothing more to say.,positive
Peter Griffins right. IT INSISTS UPON ITSELF! IT'S CALLED THE GODFATHER FOR GODS SAKES!,positive
And it is just the first one.,positive
Marlon Brando was phenomenal. Entire story was so twisty and complex it kept me on my seat. Brilliant acting and score.,positive
brilliant. the (2nd) greatest movie ever made.,positive
Phenomenal movie based on real inner turmoil within a family and the mobs of New York,positive
flawless. coppola did an amazing job directing this one. a classic,positive
"An OK Movie, I'll watch 2 & 3 someday.",negative
The second best movie I've ever seen next to Citizen Kane. It is a brilliantly directed film by Coppola. It was a very entertaining movie. I loved it very much.,positive
"Best gangster film around, other than Road To Perdition",negative
Sorry. I can't rate it a perfect 5 stars. If I gave it a perfect rating it would be one of my favorite movies ever; and it's not.,positive
One of the best movies ever made a true classic,positive
Makes me smile to see no rotten ratings on this one. Life is good.,positive
My #1 movie of all time!,positive
Fantastic. Impressive. Unique.,positive
"Now I know why Al Pacino is famous. Also, I want to watch more Francis Ford Coppola movies.",positive
THE mafia movie and overall one of the best movies ever made . You live under a rock if you haven't seen The Godfather.,positive
If i could only take one movie from my burning apartment. This would be the one.,positive
Awesome movie!! Magnificent!!!!!!!! The music.. COOL!!!!!!!!,positive
Loved it. It's a classic.,positive
"In my opinion it is the number 1 movie of all time, slightly better than Citizen Kane. But still better.",positive
"well made, great acting but a little overrated it could be something more",negative
This is really one of the first movies that I saw that I truly recognized as great. Can't say enough about this one.,positive
one of my favorite movies!,positive
"I saw this for probably the third time last night, this time on DVD. I loved it. It's one of the most perfect movies ever made in that no scene was extraneous, every bit contributed to the forward momentum, and it's an American original. The first time I saw it, I was totally sympathetic towards Don Corleone, this time not so much: I saw him as a murdeous thug. Also, this time I was struck by how improbable it was that Michael go back to Kay, tall and plain, after being married to Italian bombshell Apollania. These are nit picks, no question. It might be one of those stories it's interesting to revisit at different times of your life--like Anna Karenena.",positive
"""THE"" world's best movie ever made... absolutely!",positive
One of the best movies ever made!,positive
The greatest gift cinema has to offer.,positive
is the best movie in the cinema's history,positive
"It's the Godfather. It's well-known, it's iconic, it's revolutionary, all for good reason. What more can be said about it?",positive
Pretty much the perfect movie,positive
"A decent movie filled with a great cast, great music score, great lighting, great cinematography, and great shootout sequences, but not a film that fully amazed me nor blew me away as much as I thought it would. I honestly don't see what's so special about non-stop, boring, and unappealing talking for 3 hours straight. How is THAT suppose to make this movie entertaining overall?",negative
I love Marlin Brando. He is mentor & wisdom...,negative
"the best movie in cinema history, definitely a masterpiece of unsurpassed quality, a film that became a legend of cinema, and today is internationally recognized for its unsurpassed quality, with a fantastic cast, Marlon Brando is more than amazing , the head of the family living Corleone, Don vito Corleone gangster, with a performance that even the critics impreciona stricter, Robert Duvall also this excellent role as Cornleone family's lawyer Tom Hagen, Al Pacino shows his talents enterpretando as an actor and the son of the gangster family's new leader: Michel Cornleone, James Caan enterpreta the charismatic and explosive Sonny Corleone, the exceptional direction of Francis Ford Coppola, such a direction that will become one of the biggest and best movie directors of all times, with an intelligent story, fascinating imprecionante, aided by competent and experienced cast, the film became the best of the classics of the 70s, the film failed at any time dynamic between the characters, the story keeps us interested and impressed in the film, the very low budget after all, did not harm the story marcante.um movie that I recommend and approve in all respects, my note is a10 0 10 watch this movie, I recommend, the best movie of all time.",positive
one of greatest and interesting movies ever seen,positive
ce film et bien j aime bien,positive
I actually enjoyed it! They did a great job with wrapping up the plot. Loved the cinematography. Phenomenal acting. I still felt like I didn't know enough about the characters even though somehow they made you care for them. The timing of the story was a bit confusing but didn't really matter in the overall theme. Can't wait for the other 2!,positive
"Un peu déçu. Pas que le film m'ait atrocement déplu en tant que tel, mais qu'on se fait forcement des attentes en sachant que c'est le film no.1 de tous les temps et qu'on se retrouve en train de visionner un amas de longueurs. Certes, l'ambiance instaurée par Coppola est tout simplement magique, mais les choses tardent à évoluer, ce qui n'est habituellement pas le cas des films de mafia. Toutefois, comme on me l'a si souvent dit, c'est probablement la trilogie qui forge la réputation de Coppola, et non seulement un volet isolé. L'évolution de la famille doit être sacrément plus intéressante après presque 9h d'écoute.",positive
one of the best trilogies ever!!!,positive
One of the greatest movies ever made. That's all that needs to be said.,positive
You cant see California without Marlin Brando's eyes get the reference?,positive
Perfectly coordinated and one the most extravagant movies ever made. 5 out of 5,positive
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.",positive
"The Godfather, need anyone say any more other than, go watch it.",positive
"Who could say anything bad about this movie, its in my top ten favorite movies of all time",positive

The gangsters anthem.,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.. Marlon Brando was just mesmeric. The ultimate gangster flick!!,positive
I loved it so much I almost wanted to join the mafia!,positive
Too long... but a good story.,negative
A classic Im gonna make him an offer he cant refuse,positive
"The film teaches a lot about mob life and how important family honor can be. Though the film does not go over the top with violence, I had wished [spoiler] Michael had stayed away from the family business. It was nice to see so many stars in their younger days. Diane Keaton was almost unrecognizable.",positive
One of my favorites!,positive
"A brilliant story line made redundant by the public and the media glorifying it, to the point where it became overrated. Also, the movie had nothing to maintain my attention - it was actually quite tedious. However, Al Pacino's performance was very impressive, and that does redeem the film's overall quality.",negative
"Pretty much the perfect movie. If you don't like it, there's something horribly wrong with you.",positive
classy film of hollywood.need patience 2 see this film....one of all time greatest films,positive
The Don. Nuff said.,positive
My favourite of The Godfather trilogy!,positive
"without a doubt - one of the best, if not THE best movies ever made. Masterpiece comes to mind...",positive
"The best films are the ones that draw you in and captivate your attention, making lose sense of reality generate a mixture of emotional responses. At first glance this film may seem dull and slow, but its impossible not to lose yourself in its elegance, you become trapped in its intrigue, sharp dialogue and sudden twists until its over, and you realise that nearly 3 hours has passed.",positive
The greatest movie ever!,positive
A TIMELESS CLASSIC AND A MASTERPIECE!!.....IT GETS BETTER EVERYTIME I WATCH IT!!!!,positive
"Classic monster film. Not the original monster film, but is definitely the one that set the tone for what mob movies should. If you have never seen it watch it. If you have seen it watch it again.",positive
THE most overrated movie of all time. Don't get me wrong it has a decent enough story if you want to watch italians arguing the whole time and throwing garlic bread at each other which was funny to me. Just incredibly boring and instead of 3 hours it seems like 6 long hours.,negative
Dest drama ever made period .,positive
"i have to admit, i mainly love it for the young pacino...",positive
"Oh Yea, GANGSTA GANGSTA LOL",positive
"Awesome. Bloody, but awesome. The story about the Mafia, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and the murder scenes, all of it makes up the epic that is, The Godfather.",positive
I own the first 2 on BluRay. The 3rd one is a disagrace.,positive
"An epic story, a brilliant cast , an iconic drama, the perfect cinematic experience.",positive
Excellent performances from a great cast. Story is engaging and full of surprises.,positive
one of the greast of all time!!!!!!,positive
i think is one of the most beautiful film with actors that at this time don't exist anymore.I RECOMMEND THE FILM AT ANYBODY WHO DIDN'T SEE IT YET.,positive
there is no one like Brando,positive
a classic in every sense of the word...it's still one of the best films out there,positive
"The Godfather is pure story, with no particular message and little symbolism. It's just a very satisfying drama, and that's what makes it so beautiful.",positive
Possibly the best movie of all time.,positive
Greatest Movie Of All Time!!,positive
"Undeniably one of the greatest films ever made, and impossible to describe further than it already has been. ""The Godfather"" is the unique, rare masterpiece that comes one in a hundred lifetimes, being catharsic and revolutionary artistic in every sense of the word and others yet to be made.",positive
"As people can tell by looking on my profile that i have recently been rating classic movies so that being the case i thought i should rate the best movie ever the god father with a great cast, Franics Ford Coppola takes a sub par classic pulp novel and transcends it to a masterpiece that demands deep thought and many views.",positive
the classic gangster movie of all time..but remember also edward g robinson movies...and public enemy number one?...james cagney?...movies were awesome years ago..this one is not as old as cagney or bogart movies...but those started these type..which lead to others as american me with eddie olmos...this one made the career of al pacino...before scarface!,positive
"This one requires a second watching to get all the intricacies of the story. It's pretty long, and there's a lot of material to ingest. It is worth it, though...if you haven't seen it, go watch it! (Not at 2 in the morning, though...)",positive
One of the greatest films of all time.,positive
"A tale of violence intertwined with love, family, respect, loyalty, betrayal, and vengeance. Never before have mobsters been portrayed in such a human light. Michael's transformation from war-hero to ruthless don gets on my nerves everytime...in a good way. A terrific performance by the whole cast, especially Marlon Brando. A benchmark for the crime genre.",positive
The story of a family business. The story of a repescted loyal criminal. The story of a son who gets involved with the family business. The story of don corleone.The story of michael corleone. The story of the godfather. Five stars. Mob/criminal movie lovers pleaseeee watch. I highly recommend this movie to you.,positive
"It's great to see why this film became a classic, a classic that never dies and will always be remembered as one of the best American movies. I like the way the story is told and the family values they show with great importance. Nowadays in crime films they tend to be a little flat, that's why they can't trascent.

"superb Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall, Keaton, Shire...whew",positive
Words can not describe the beauty of this movie. A must watch on anybodies list before you die...,positive
"Whilst being a very good film, I can't but feel that it is constantly overhyped. If you're looking for Sicilian salaciousness, and enough blood to swim in, this movie isn't for you. If you're looking for a movie to observe and measure the development of characters, however, this is perfect. At two hours and fifty five minutes, you might want to get comfy. Just try not to fall asleep.",positive
I like this movie regardless what you say.,positive
A classic mob movie. One of the greatest movies ever made period,positive
Its one of the greatest classic gangster films of all time. Still holds No.1 position of movies of all time. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo with one of the greatest scripts. The casting was another excellent blended one. There are no words to explain the acting of Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. All other members of Corleone family delivered excellent performances especially James Caan (Sonny) and Al Pacino (Michael). No doubt to be its must watch.,positive
One of the greatest . . . Love Pacino,positive
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.,positive
"It's the second most beautiful film I've ever seen, but it's not the entertaining one out there. PLOT:In 1940s New York, the Italian mafia families rule. One of these families in particular is the Corleone family, in which a Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) leads. People in need, such as close friends and celebrities, come to him for help, and he supplies it in whatever ways necessary. When he denies working with a drug dealer, he's ambushed and shot on the spot. He lives, but now it's up to his family to protect him and bring him justice. His son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), takes on the role of serving him justice by planning a kill with the family. This spins off into a whole series of events which I choose not to spoil. It's a good idea for a plot and executed beautifully. ACTING:All performances in this film were great. Brando flawlessly performed the role of Vito Corleone, the godfather. Pacino did a brilliant job as well. Just about everyone shined in here, but the honorable mentions go to James Caan as Sonny, Lenny Montana as Luca Brasi, and Simonetta Stefanelli as Apollonia. SCORE:This film has some of the most beautiful themes I've heard in a film, especially the main theme by itself. OTHER CONTENT:This is definitely one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen next to ""2001"". Every scene from meetings, to love, to death is filmed with such delicacy and tenderness that it comes off as near perfect. The only flaw I was able to find in the film was that it didn't come off as the most exciting or entertaining film out there. I found it lengthy and found myself wondering, ""When will this end?"" ""2001"" intrigued me, but this was a bit monotonous. Nevertheless, Coppola's direction is still rock solid and brilliant. I have definitely earned some respect for him. OVERALL,an awesome film with a beautifully executed plot, great acting, beatiful score, and near perfect filming with rock-solid direction, but it was a little monotonous and lengthy at times.",positive

HUZZAH classic film with some great mafia quotes and stereotype,positive
This film has a great cast. It is the best organized-crime flick to date.,positive
I certainly see what the sensation was about.,positive
An amazing movie that blends the mafia genre with such emotion that it culminates in a surprisingly heartfelt journey for the Corleone family and the viewer.,positive

no words can do this film justice.,positive
"Obviously one of the best films ever created, but definitely not the best. And that is enough said.",positive
Probably my favorite movie of all time.... go see it!,positive
Class acting and great film but then its hard to watch it without seeing its merits due to the reputation it has in the film world. It is slightly too long in my opinion but a very good film all the same.,positive
Pinnacle of American film.,positive
"Petty gripes aside this film is 40 years old and is still a pinnacle to which other films are judged. Bravo. I am not going to rate the Godfather based on reputation and achievement like so many other reviewers on RT. It is impossible for me to compare this movie to others of its generation and its impact because I simply wasn't around. It is undeniable that the Godfather breaks ground in almost every category of its era and is a timeless film that can be enjoyed for a millenia to come. But as I compare it with modern day gangster films, I simply cannot allow myself to give it a perfect score. There are one too many scenes in the nearly 3 hour film that I find myself distracted during, for instance, the opening wedding celebration. I get that to truly honor and represent the Italian traditions the celebration had to be accurate but a little too much singing and dancing for me.",positive

what can i say... must watch,positive
"Talk about a movie with a lot of hype surrounding. I was worried it wouldn't live up to its hype, because that happens to me a lot, which is why I didn't like 300 or never watched Borat.

Classic mob movie. Watching this is mandatory for any movie goer,positive
"So I am a movie guy as most of you know, but I have never seen the Godfather trilogy so I bought the blueray collection and watched the first one tonight. Great movie for sure. Some of my favorite actors and actresses of all time are in it. I can't believe the movie was made in 1972. BTW won the Oscar for best film!",positive
Every mob movie ever made would not of ever been produced had it not been for this movie. A must see.,positive
Great show. Need to watch it again.,positive
"A masterpiece, only matched by Godfather II",positive
Arguably the greatest motion picture ever made.,positive
"Because it opens with a wedding, each new viewing of ""The Godfather"" feels like a happy reunion with familiar characters. And each time it is bittersweet because we know what will happen to all of them in the end. But there are seemingly endless new details to uncover, and film writers have provided a steady stream of new interpretations to consider. Count the times that doors close on women, shutting them out of the macho world of the cosa nostra-a phone booth door, a bathroom door, a study door. Notice, as writer Pablo Villaça does, how the color of Kay's clothes change from bright red to dull beige as she gets pulled further into Michael's toxic orbit. Look at the way Vito Corleone and Tom Hagen reflexively touch their faces, cuffs, and collars after difficult conversations, a nervous tic that Michael, in his coldness, does not seem to share, and which seems significant only because everything in this dense production seems purposeful and meaningful. Consider, like historian Bruce Schulman, whether Michael-an American war hero with an American girlfriend who ultimately cannot escape his Sicilian roots-is a metaphor for failed cultural assimilation. Maybe some of these observations are stretches, the products of our obsessive love for a movie that director Francis Ford Coppola reportedly considers a studio film and that Orson Welles called ""the glorification of a bunch of bums who never existed."" There's some truth in those criticisms, just as there is truth in the paeans and the deep analyses. Maybe there's no such thing as a perfect movie. But ""The Godfather"" looks, sounds, and feels very, very close, even the Nth time around.",positive
I'm glad I don't have a horse.,positive
"If you haven't seen this movie, we can't be friends.",positive
"Every genre has the film that achieves the highest level of perfection. The Godfather (at least in its genre) is that film. To put it simply, this film is a true masterpiece.",positive
The greatest movie ever made bar none. It is the most amazing movie by actors that are great above and beyond,positive

knocked this one down half a star simply b/c I liked the second one better,positive
One of my all time favorites!,positive
One of the greatest crime movies ever. You can't say much about The Godfather because it's already considered by millions as the greatest movie of all time!,positive
"In terms of mood and atmosphere, almost without equal. The direction, cinematography and visceral, engaging performances all contribute equally to a movie that has to stand as one of the greatest artistic achievements of the 20th century.",positive
Do you spend time with your family? Good. Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.,positive
"'Perfect' is the only word that I have to describe this movie. Perfect cast, perfect direction, perfect cinematography, perfect music, perfect script, perfect scenery.... PERFECT. Enough said.",positive

"Rarely in a film has a collaboration yielded such rewarding results. In 1970, author Mario Puzo teamed with director Francis Ford Coppola to create one of the most brilliant pieces of cinema ever created. It took a while for the studio to embrace it, but eventually it became one of the best films of all time. Based on Puzo's original bestselling novel (and also co-authoring the screenplay), The Godfather tells the story of the Corleones, a mob family whose lives are put on display. A predecessor to all crime dramas that came after it, The Godfather has stood the test of time and is as fresh and entertaining as it was in 1972 because it's not so much about the crime, but rather it's about family. Willis Gordon wastes no energy in creating a color palette that's realistic, yet cinematic in scope. Marlon Brando's brilliant portrayal of Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's more subtle performance as Michael are undoubtedly performances of a lifetime. James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard S. Castellano, Abe Vigoda and Diane Keaton are also here to round out the stellar cast So many films come and go, especially during this area, and very few times there are what are considered to be perfect films. This is one of them. If you haven't seen this, you should, right away.",positive
Whoever says fight club is the best movie ever? They obviously never have seen this or the second,positive
"How the director tell the story is very well paced and quietly engaging. But it also owed the actors big, they look so charismatic and convincing. 3 hours full of ""what will happened next?""",positive
Undoubtll the best movie ever made. It is 3 hours of perfection. The brilliance lies in the family ties and how these men have found riches in America. Every time I watch it it feels fresh.,positive
"Possibly the greatest mobster film ever made, (Only to maybe The Godfather Part II), The Godfather perfectly executes the elements of suspense, love, and loss. The whole atmosphere of the film just makes the audience want to be a part of a world that few understand. Brando has become larger than life with his performance as Don Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is mesmerizing as Don's son Michael Corleone. While throughout this whole film, John Cazale, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, and the rest of the cast just add to the already awesome environment that is The Godfather. A must see for anyone who wishes to go into the movie buisness, or just loves films.",positive
"I will not lie. This review has made me a bit nervous to write of. It's not in any lack of ability to its really--where to begin? We all grew up hearing lines from the film, we all know it's weight and contribution to film but what can you even say of a story so engrossing that it captivates and really changes you? The good; the acting, the dialogue, all set pieces, character development and a true look at the American dream. The good. Have you ever viewed a film where someone in the background is doing something obscene? Or out of place? Or out of tune with the scene? Of course you have but you will not find it here. From the wedding, to the street beat down to the back and forth between countries EVERY performance big and small only lends itself to the world you're enveloped in. The leads nearly go without saying are titanic performances so much so that on the day of ANY female family members wedding if someone asks for a favor you nearly smile and retort, "" You come to me on the day of etc. etc."" That being said however you can easily recant not only the general story but in specifics. For me my favorite performance was of the ill fated first wife of Michael. So innocent, so beautiful up until her firey last moments no fear in her eyes. The dialogue here really feels Americana in specific italian americana. It doesnt feel stereotypical, it doesnt feel derogatory. It flows. Even in it's very gritty delivery. A movie being quotable is a mark of entertainment, a movie being relatable in its delivery is transformative. My great grandfather served in world war 2 so trying to view the world back then was really only in photographs and recanted stories. However seeing New York as such made this believable. Keep in mind this was nearly thirty years after the fact and seventy years now and these set pieces absolutly phenominal. Especially of the foreign pieces, very vacant, very rustic yet with a clear mark of civilization and of family. These set pieces not only convey a world they give it a voice, a feel and a soul. Each character really changes in the film. Vito, Kay and especially Mike. Seeing a wide eyed, albiet wise, young man turn into a cold yet somehow loving man of power, is nearly mythological in weight. His fall is miniscule in comparison to his rise to prowess and how all he does effects those around him. What is the american dream? According to my studies in sociology it is the capability to aquire enough monetary to maintain a certain style of living, to put your children through school and to earn a certain rank within society. From this standpoint alone the Corleone family does such. Yet with what means? This film is a very indepth look into our culture as Americans. What we have to do to attain this dream. To become it and at what costs. This family is by all means succesful. Yet they lose so much and place the burden upon the young, indirectly of course, but is this not an American tale? When I finished viewing the piece I sat down and thought long and hard on the commentary it conveyed. Is our American dream so bright? Or is there something perhaps dark in the means of acquiring it? I do not mean this of every avenue of course but to play devil's advocate at times can't hurt. The bad. Nothing. This film is beautifully done. It's pace is never slack, it slows down when needs be but always delivers. It's shots are always in sharp focus as if to say ""Look. Damn it look."" This is a masterpiece and has earned a rightful following of fans of the genre and of film as a whole. This piece succeeds in entertainment, in catalyzing thought and in showing what a good film is. The next time you hear someone quote, or speak of a specific scene perhaps bring up the underlying idealistic tones of the film and make sure this film maintains a rightful place in the public mind. 10/10",positive
"Perhaps the closest thing to a perfect film we may ever see...unbelievable acting, story, drama, romance, comedy, action...even the little things are perfectly done...bravo!",positive

The Godfather is an amazing movie. I would recommend it to anyone.,positive

"'The Godfather' (1972) is not the brightest film, but is most memorable and has a mysterious dark beauty a director would cherish.",positive
A great One it's a must see,negative
Absolutely incredible movie. Might be a perfect film.,positive
This by far has to be one of the best gangster movies of all time. The Godfather stays true to portraying exactly what mob family life was like and used the motifs of gangster films. This movie was amazing along with its other 2 parts.,positive
"This movie was not exaggerated when I heard that it was one of the best mobster movie ever made. The godfather was so good because of all of the family ties and ""real"" problems someone might face",positive
"First of all, I saw this movie at the age of 20, and many years after it's release, the acting is great from Brando, Pacino, Duval and Caan, the pace of the story makes you feel you are living with them, it shows how a human's life can change 180 degrees in an instant. One of the best movies of all time.",positive
this film is brilliant,positive
"I tried twice before to watch this movie, but always ended up stopping somewhere around 3/4 of the way through. This time I went in with the right mindset, and instead of expecting a fast modern action movie, I knew this would be a slow, nuanced, character-centric piece. Indeed, without the element of shock - once pioneering but now comparatively mellow - this movie loses a lot of the punch it originally had, resting instead on the strength of its script, cinematography and performances. That being said, it's only once I'd seen the whole thing and given it time to sink in that it really became clear that this is a heck of an epic tale. It isn't quick entertainment, it's a trip through the life and the world of the Godfather. There's just something about the movie that feels extremely nostalgic after seeing it. I could go on about how excellent the performances are or how well-crafted the whole thing is, but that all goes without saying. What makes this truly special is how it goes beyond that to create a story that just stays with you, if only you give it the patience it deserves.",positive
The best movie of the history. I don't know why is the second one,positive

This detailed film about the Corleone family is no doubt, the greatest movie I have ever watched. Even forty years later, this has still made a great impact on how I judge movies today. I don't believe any film will ever live up to The Godfather. Ever. Ever.",positive
"If you don't like this movie, have a strong look in the mirror",positive
Coppola and the troupe of actors he assembled created an amazing film. Part II actually excels this film if you can believe that.,positive
"By far the best movie ever made, period-end discussion.",positive
This is the 8th time me watching this movie.,positive
"Obviously revolutionary for its time but from fresh eyes, it could've used some serious editing. Michael had 3 arcs that would've been better in a different film. Brando is brilliant.",negative
"It's actually not that bad, guys,",positive
No review necessary.,positive
"A good movie if you can sit through it. Either all my friends I try to show it too have A.D.D. or it is too slow for today's audience. Either way, this is a classic.",positive
It's the godfather. Need I say anymore.,positive
"Epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. Vito Corleone is The Godfather, the Don (head) of a successful, tightly-knit family whose business is organized crime.",positive
"The characters are incredible, the plot developes perfectly, and the music is gripping. You don't find many movies that even come close to the power of this film.",positive
"A truly flawless film. Coppola manages to paint an image of this family, their hardships, they're good times, and everything in between. You really feel for the characters, and stylistically, this film is amazing. Honestly... when that opening song starts, I get the shivers.",positive
One of the best films ever made. A great cast and a great story. Not much more to ask from this film.,positive
The Kingpin of mafia movies.Mandatory.,positive
Without a doubt the greatest piece of cinema ever made. A true masterpiece.,positive
The definitive gangster movie. An amazing classic.,positive
simply the greatest American film.,positive
This movie is technically perfect. Everyone who wants to film movies should see this one as a star to follow.,positive
"Not quite the greatest movie of all time, but an absolute treasure nonetheless. The acting, story and iconic scenes all still hold up today and put the vast majority of modern movies to shame. Brando, Pacino, Caan etc. put together make up one of the finest and most well rounded casts ever seen in a film. Those with an appreciation of classic films should surely pay The Godfather the highest respects.",positive
"a strong story well scripted with superb acting from Marlon Brando and Al pacino, beautiful music. even after ages the movie seems to be fresh and one can not even miss a second . After watching you love to watch it again and again.",positive
"This is a cinematic masterpiece that nothing else even comes close to. How I wish movies of today could have such beautiful, complex character development! If you are a ""Jersey Shore"" kind of person, skip this one. I 100% guarantee you will be too stupid to comprehend it.",positive
"classic movie Brando is amazing in this rock star cast. Al Pacino, Robert Duvuall, James Cann, Diane Keaton",positive
I can't say anything about this film that hasn't already be said before. This is a marvelous film from beginning to end. The Acting is absolutely perfect for every single character. In my opinion Al Pacino gives the best performance in the film and it is a crime that He and Marlon Brando didn't both win Best Actor of the year. He is not a supporting actor but instead makes the film his own in the scenes that he is in. He is so cold and menacingly brilliant as Michael Corleone. I love the mood and the romantic tone of the film. The Music is awe Inspiring and tremendously poetic. Probably one of the best soundtracks ever. I also love James Caan and Robert Duvall in their respective roles. Many people think that art house films and old classics are movies that are impossible to really get into. That is not true for the Godfather. I actually find the movie to be incredibly enjoyable to watch with my entire family and I never get bored of watching it. Team Coppola all the way.,positive
"my god marlo brandon is just hudge ... this film it couldnt be better without him ,",positive
the best one..............!!!!!,positive
Al Pacino and Brando - WOW.,positive
a pretty freaken awsome movie,positive
"Marlon Brando's performance is magnificent, truly compelling. We care about Don Corleone and admire his reasonableness due to him. It's rare in films that the audience can connect so effectively with an anti-hero but in this film we do. Every moment is to be savoured because this story is a true masterpiece.",positive
Perfect. Simply Perfect.,positive
It sets the standard.,positive
Wow Probably going to be lynched but can't believe I have never seen this film before today!!! Thank you Netflix. Epic film. Looking forward to watching sequel,positive

The wedding sequence... is a virtuoso stretch of filmmaking: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world. Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert,positive
Do I even have to say anything? I think it speaks for itself. Incredible.,positive

"The Godfather is number 2 on my list of the greatest films of all time, only behind Citizen kane. It's the perfect story, it goes beyond just a mob or ganster film.",positive
Believe all you read. As much suspense and tension you will need in 2 1/4hrs,positive
No commentary necessary. Quite simply the best piece of cinema ever created.,positive
"""The Godfather"" (which I first saw back in 2006) is indeed a film classic that should always be remembered & never forgotten. With great/tense acting (especially Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone), dramatic settings, & perfect story, I would like to shake director Francis Ford Coppola's hand & say ""Thank you, Mr. Coppola."" A must watch for anyone into drama/noir/mafia films.",positive
GREAT CAST! Coppola takes Puzzo's novel and brings it to life in one of the best films of the last 100 years.,positive
"One of my all time favorites, one of the greatest films of all time.",positive
"It's, uh, The Godfather. 'Nuff said.",positive
"What can I say, perfect in every way. It's not often you watch a three hour film and think to yourself ""That could've been longer"".",positive
"I couldn't say any negative thing about this movie. I have had probably seen it like 12th times now, and it was so freaking perfect.",positive
ten stars if it were possible,positive
Excellent across the board. Brando deserved the Oscar for this and Al Pacino gives a perfect character set up for his magnum opus.,positive
The most American Film up to date (and the best one too).,positive
Best movie ever made!,positive
"Truly Amazing! What a film!! In my opinion [and the opinion of many] this is a ""perfect"" movie. It just had everything a film should have. Just go down the list and check off everything great about it. It was so interesting to see Micheal's [Al Pacino] change! A family member that wanted nothing to do with his father's involement in the mafia to the new head ""Don"" who transforms and sells his soul for the family business. The scene in the restaurant where he shoots the crooked cop is cinematic movie history. I was amazed at the irony of Al Pacino's character in this movie. He fiercely loved his family yet, if a family member got in the way of the business, he had them taken care of. Just his demeanor in how he spoke to Fredo [his brother] or Connie [his sister]...[or anyone], you knew he would do whatever was necessary if someone didn't listen to him. Marlon Brando was great but I felt Al Pacino stole the spotlight [as did Robert Dinero in pt 2]. I could go on and on about so many scenes but this review would be way too long. lol Basically, The Godfather is probably the greatest movie ever made!",positive
"Having seen it on amc last night, I loved it. Theres almost nothing to say. The casting is impeccable. The storytelling is beautiful.Honestly, the perfect film.",positive
This is a true classic. The Godfather is for sure one of the greatest film ever made. With great acting and performances. And great dialogue. The whole movie is just great! It's just a perfect film. A masterpiece.,positive
"This is truly a classic film, great performances, great direction, great production. The only bad thing is that I feel like this movie is a BIT overrated. But only a BIT, it's still a great film and deserves about 90% of it's critical acclaim.",positive
One of the best movies of all time! The Spike Channel is celebrating its 40th anniversay with a broadcast of the trilogy.,positive
"The best movie adaptation of a book ever! Electrifying performances make electrifying characters come to life. Add a great Oscar-worthy direction and the perfect music, and you have a true classic.",positive
simply one of the best,positive
"Don Vito Corleone: ""I understand."" ""You found paradise in America, you had a good trade, you made a good living."" ""The police protected you and there were courts of law."" ""You didn't need a friend like me."" ""But, now you come to me, and you say, Don Corleone, give me justice."" ""But you don't ask with respect."" ""You don't offer friendship."" ""You don't even think to call me Godfather."" ""Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you ask me to do murder for money."" ""An offer you can't refuse."" Watching this movie is a offer I can't refuse. The Godfather is nothing short of a perfect film. The acting is perfect, the dialogue is memorable, and the pacing is fantastic. Also the chemistry between this cast is nothing short of amazing. The Godfather has a cast filled with likable characters such as, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino my favorite actor), Sonny Corleone (James Caan), Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), and Tom Hagan (Robert Duvall). Whatever emotion they had on screen I felt connected to them and, I was feeling the same exact emotion. As I said before the dialogue in this film is memorable. Every time I watch this film I always know what Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is going to say in the opening scene. And I always find myself quoting this movie a lot. So it's safe to say that every actor in this film delivers there lines perfectly. Also the soundtrack fits the tone of this film perfectly. The kills and gunfights in this are epic and monumental. Overall The Godfather is a perfect, epic, unforgettable, and a masterpiece. My favorite mafia/mob film.",positive
"I honestly didn't get what's so great about. It's beautifully shot, I suppose but that's just it. The Acting is good, especially Brando in particular. But I just didn't find myself in awe of it's acclaimed ""Greatness"". It' alright...I suppose.",negative
"A masterpiece. Every scene is perfect. The pacing, the shots, the acting. All is perfect. This is arguably the greatest movie of all time.",positive
"This film contains some of the best scenes in any movie that I have seen. The atmosphere, writing, and acting are perfect and it is clear that many movies have followed in the footsteps of Coppola's epic work.",positive
"From after watching this film, I have been trying to figure out some of this film's faults and other than a couple due to lack of certain technology, I cannot hardly think of any. The movie is what everyone is saying. I was thinking that this film shouldn't be known as the perfect movie because it is rated R and not suitable for children, but that is what makes it so perfect. Coppala directed a real film based off the novel of the same name and of the many groups of mobs that walked among us in the distant past. The dramatic acting in this film is nothing short of spectacular. Marlon, Al, James, and Robert were an amazing ensemble because they can show and act all those multiple emotions well. Seriousness, anger, sorrow, and pride are what I saw through the actors' mannerisms. I hope I'm not the only one to mention this but, was the telling of Michael's travels and life in Italy really necessary? I don't think we needed to see everything, maybe just show Mike walking around in Italy looking out as if missing Kay and hoping to go back home soon. His Italian wife gets blown up and then it's like he settles with Kay? Why did he cheat? Or was his time in Italy meant to teach him the way of being the head of the family? I wish I saw more of Diane Keaton in this. I'm sure I'll see more of her femininity as to balance with Al's masculinity in the next two films. I especially loved James Caan in this because Sonny was tough and looked out for his family, especially his sister when her husband would beat her. This film is wonderful because it depicts the life of a mob family and how they must live their life. The history of their family goes far back. Michael tells Kay that she doesn't want to be a part of what his family does but as soon as he does his first killing, he gets into that mindset that he is to become the new head of the family. I don't want to seem like I'm giving in to peer pressure to keep the perfected feeling of The Godfather alive as to grant the film a 100% but I also want to have my own voice of criticism. I truly wish I could at least give this film a 95% and I can't seem to give it a 100%. This film is a fantastic masterpiece. In my brain, this movie is a 90% but in my heart, it is a 101%. I love this film and I am incredibly grateful and happy to have seen it. The Godfather, I give you a 90%. Actually I don't want to ruin tradition. I can't fight it; this film is worth a 100%.",positive
If you don't love this movie get yourself checked. You're probably mentally handicapped and can probability get some really great state aid.,positive
The most famously glorified mafia movie ever. Has an undisputed cast of talent with long drawn out drama and violence. Many iconic lines and characters have been mimicked from this classic.,positive
"Masterfully acted and brilliantly directed, The Godfather is one of the classics that everyone have to see.",positive
The Godfather is a classic. There is a reason why it is 100% on rottentomatoes. The story is brilliant. The writing is brilliant. The acting is brilliant. There isn't too much more to be said. Just see the movie and cherish it.,positive
"Wow, even the boring parts were engaging. I was blown away by this film.",positive
Best movie I've ever seen.,positive
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse. :),positive
"The epic story of a 1940s New York Mafia family has stood the test of time, and remains one of the most well scripted, brilliantly acted, and superbly produced films of all time. Achieving legendary status, immense influence and countless references since its release, I watched The Godfather for the first time as somewhat of an enigma. But I was pleasantly surprised to discover how timeless, and how perfectly presented it is. From the opening scene of Vito Corleone receiving requests from family members and acquaintances in a silent room at his daughter's wedding, to the symbolic closing door at the end, the atmosphere is perfectly defined and engaging throughout its entire 3 hour length, never once relapsing into the mundane or superfluous. It brings the somewhat shallow gangster film genre to whole new depths, documenting an epic family drama; their trials and their achievements, their rivals and their battles, the fall of their patriarch and the rise of a new one. The Godfather features some of the most iconic scenes in film history. Indeed, the restaurant scene is one of the most perfectly produced scenes of all time. Although some of the cultural value of The Godfather is probably lost on me, it is undeniably one of the landmarks of cinema, and truly deserving of its iconic status.",positive
"A little long-winded and self-righteous at parts, this is a movie you simply can't refuse.",positive
"The original Godfather set the standard for mob movies, and its impact is still being felt today.",positive
greatest film ever made bar none,positive
"Ok totally a mans film, i understand it's a great movie an all but the ending gets alittle fuzzy for me, still good film thou :)",negative
"The best movie ever made, a cinematic masterpiece.",positive
"This is perhaps the best movie I've ever seen. Everything about it shines with brilliance, and I wouldn't mind watching it again twice in a row. This movie is classy to an extreme, and definitely worth the 3 hours of my time that it is.",positive
"Probably the best Mafia movie ever made. Marlon Brando does yet another oustanding performance, as does Al Pacio, and pretty much the whole cast. Francis Ford Coppela crafts this film brillinatly. This is by far one of the best movies ever made.",positive
"I like it, comes with the territory of loving gangster stories",positive
"A true cinema classic from opening to closing this film is outstanding. The Godfather encompasses brilliant acting, directing, screenplay, score, and cinematography. This is one of the best films ever made.",positive
"Brilliant movie! Everything about it! (cast, director, script, score)",positive
One of the greatest movie. Its about a Mafia gang that has been formed by an immigrant from Sicily. It is an epic adventure and the soundtrack is just amazing! You will never find a better movie and you will not waste your time learning from it. One of the best performance by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino,positive
This is quite simply my all-time faves of all the movies I have EVER seen in my life!!!,positive
Best movie ever made. Period,positive
"disappointed but okay. I dont know what people see in this film, nothing realy happens, everything is dragged on too much, like the wedding at the start and everything else. there are some good bits though",negative
"Marlon Brando's performance and Ford Coppolla's direction are what makes the Godfather especially outstanding. Audiences probably wouldn't have thought of a better crime film at the time in their heads, and every better one since followed this one's path to some degree. It's also rather long and exhausting, but worth the watch and celebration of great cinema, no matter what the taste.",positive
"The greatest movie ever made about organized crime ever. It holds no rival and the depth, story and acting hold more than their own. Amazing.",positive
Dear brother-in-law sent me 1 & 2 on Blu-ray and I'm loving every single frame of the film.,positive
Just picked up the trilogy on blu-ray. Awesome.,positive
Jedan od najboljih filmova ikada!,positive
"Clássico do cinema e até hoje imitado, 'O Poderoso Chefão' é o tipo de filme obrigatório para quem ama cinema ou simplesmente para quem deseja conhecê-lo um pouco mais. Além de ser dono de uma das maiores performances da carreira de Marlon Brando (um dos maiores atores da história do cinema), apresentou novos talentos do porte de Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall e Diane Keaton para as grandes massas. Imperdível.",positive
It's only the best time ever!,positive
There's plenty of reasons this film is the gold-standard not just for gangster films but films in general; not the least of which is Ford Coppola's marvelous eye.,positive
"reminds me of my dads side of the family, maybe thats why hes been making me watch it since i was 7",negative

Classic. By far the best of the trilogy.,positive
You come to me for a favor,positive
Exciting and grim. A dark story laced with violent massacres.,positive
THE perfect gangster film. Nuff said.,positive
"juzzzzzzz one word ""IT'S THE GOD OF MOVIES""",positive
"Whilst Gangster films are not generally the genre I enjoy, The Godfather is much more than that. It is a film about family, and the dealings of a life of crime and its effects on the ones closest to you. Acted to perfection, and as dark and gritty as you could ever ask for, it's got to be recommended, even if it isn't ever going to be my pick for the greatest film of all time.",positive
"The Godfather did not live up to all my expectations, based on the things I had heard about it. Don't let that mean it was not a joy to watch. It felt as if real mob families were recorded. The plot was very well thought out. The make-up artists did a very good job with showing injuries and aging. It deserves to be called a classic and must-watch. The movie progressed very slowly, but there was always something happening. It actually requires you to pay attention the whole time. As was with movies of this time, some acting was exaggerated, but not nearly as much as was the norm. But, Brando and Pacino were flawless. Marvelous. They embodied their roles so well. I'm excited to watch the other two. Watched and written 05/25/2013.",positive
"Yep. It's as amazing as everybody says it is. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise, they're lying to you.",positive
"Great acting and some very special performances, amazing gripping storey, the daddy of all gangster films",positive
A movie that established new benchmarks for cinema. Amazing story. Amazing acting. Amazing film. This movie is indeed one of the greatest films of all time.,positive
Amazing - Best movie Ever..,positive
"This film is regarded as one of the best films of all time and I strongly agree because it is the start of one of the finest trilogies in film history. There are many American mafia/gangster films around and many are fantastic but none match the level of this compelling and brilliant tale of a 1940's mafia family. If you have never seen the godfather films then you are truly missing out, there is much to appreciate in these films and this film truly defines the word masterpiece. If there has to be a negative aspect then the film feels like it is wrapping up only half way through but I am sure you won't want to stop watching.",positive
The Best Mafia movie of all time,positive
"This film is really one of the best dramas of all time. The tenderness, the coldness, the love, the hate, the violence, the civility - gangsters of the past were really an exercise in paradoxes, especially since much of The Godfather is based on truth. I was almost too happy to learn from a documentary book on the Mafia that Marlon Brando's genteel patriarch was based on a real person. Before gangster life became thug life, there was indeed much to look at. This film is no different. Also, before Pacino smoked his way into sounding the way he does now, he sounded the way he did here in The Godfather, where he both looks and sounds like a completely different, comparatively and substantially understated master puppeteer. It's a real pity they only seem interested in showing Shoutcino nowadays. 'HOO-AH!'",positive
"Had I seen this when it was made, perhaps I would like it more than I do.",negative
The Perfect movie. Awesome!,positive
The title is normally given to Citizen Kane but it is in my opinion that The Godfather is the greatest American film of all time.,positive
"Definitely one of my best movies , especially Marlon Brando's performance .",positive
"Best Movie, I've ever seen, PERIOD. There is just no movie that could come anywhere Near THIS ONE.",positive
A must see classic. One of the greatest films ever made.,positive

I loved all of the Godfather movies,positive

O.G. Is all I can say!,positive
"The greatest motion picture of all time! Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are simply masterful, and Robert Duvall and James Caan are awesome in their roles also. Greatest script with some of the best actions ever, especially at the end. One of few films which I watch on a regular basis.",positive
"This is a perfect film through and through, with one of the greatest performances of all time by Brando. This is a landmark film.",positive
"The violent masterpiece of American crime films, The Godfather is a classic in every sense of the term. Filled with a layered script and nuanced acting, its hard not to appreciate.",positive
Greatest Movie Ever Made !!!!!,positive
"Didn't reaal get it? you guiz? Was really stupidly made, no comic relief? i seen this right after reel steel, so i had a high mindset goin into this. reeal steal was waaay better tho, it was great. gonna review right after this shit. who the fuck is marlon brando? al paccy is good when he is killin' people in movies, but not here. it was just ok for him. final thoughts: go see reeel steeal",negative
Well constructed movie. Great acting by everyone(Marlon Brando was really special and Al Pacino acted really good). Highly recommended.,positive
"Within at least a couple more generations of film critics, I'm fairly sure that THE GODFATHER will replace CITIZEN KANE as the widely accepted 'best film of all time'. I don't know about what the best film of all time would be, but I wouldn't presume that I know. I haven't seen every movie in order to compare, and I don't think a lot of films can be suitably compared with each other. Regardless, THE GODFATHER is a damn fine film and a towering example of classic-style cinema. It's certainly one that requires multiple viewings to best appreciate its epic scope and depth. It has a very distinct style and tone that's like film noir crossed with classical music and powerful themes of the American dream that are amplified further in the sequel. It's very heavy and serious stuff, but avoids the risk of becoming pretentious and maintains a human relatability. Despite the dark themes and violence at play, the film has an almost soothing nature. Even so, the film is surprisingly not as violent as its reputation suggests, probably because that part of its legacy is carried over from when it was new and such depictions of violence were still novel as the Production Code had only recently been replaced by the MPAA rating system. The removal of the production code allowed the new American classics to be unrestrained by the previous Draconian restrictions and approach new themes and in different ways. Had it been made a few years before, it would have been entirely different, and probably not as high in the pantheon of cinema that it is today.",positive
The best in the history of cinema .. this movie make me a big fan for cinema .. my nickname from this movie : DON .. Al Pacino THE KING,positive
I do not need to say anything except: Treat 1 and 2 as the same film.,positive

A wedding. A horse head. A murder. A handgun behind the toilet. Another wedding. A car-bomb. An orange peel. A funeral. A baptism. A closed door.,positive
One of the greatest and the most hard hitting crime movies I have ever seen. Complete justice done to Mario Puzo's epic crime drama. A Must watch!,positive
I put cotton balls in my mouth and no one took me seriously.,positive

"The definitive mafia film, and Coppola's magnum opus.",positive
Consider this film class 101 with Brando and Francis Ford Coppola.,positive
"A long, but captivating crime movie with an outstanding script, memorable score, iconic scenes and a marvelous cast highlighted by the performances of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. A movie about family, tradition, treason and the contrasting transformation of the character of Michael Corleone throughout the whole film.",positive
The scene where Mike kills McCluskey and Sollozzo is one of my favorite scene in the movie.,positive
The greatest film of all time. Without a doubt.,positive
"The most perfect movie of all time. There is not one flaw, if you find one I will quickly be able defend it and make you realize you were wrong. Marlon Brando is the greatest actor ever. Al Pacino has never nor will he ever be Better. Caan, Duvall, Shire are too shabby themselves. It is the greatest piece of American Art ever.",positive
"Greatest movie ever filmed, hands down.",positive
"Well there is nothing more to say about the film which yet holds a record of ""100%"" fresh! It isn't true. It is getting more and more fresh as the entire saga remains an ever growing, timeless diamond! A Pyramid of Giza for world's film industry!",positive

UN CHEF D'OEUVRE!!!!!!!,positive
"Veto Corleone ""The Godfather"" (Marlon Brando) is the Don Corleone. The Don of a mafia family means the head. He is the most powerful Don in the world. He is loved, feared, and worshipped. He is vicious, brutal, but you love him. You love him because he is a family man that will do anything to help a family member. They develop that more in the book, and in the flashback sequences of the 2nd film. The film starts off on the day of his daughters wedding, and the Don can't refuse a request on the day of his daughters wedding. A man whose daughter had been raped by a few boys is requesting for justice, and he wants him to murder them. The Godfather says that is not justice because his daughter is still alive, but he will take care of them. It is a long scene that gets imitated, and many parodies have been done from that scene. It is a classic scene that I love. What's unique about it is the acting the look, the voice, personality, and the lines that Marlon Brando has in the scene. It is one of many things in the film that makes it so remarkable. When an assassination gets attempted on him he is put in a coma after being shot five times in the back. He got shot because he refused to accommodate Turk Sollozzo in his drug dealing business because that would upset his political connections, and he would lose some of his power. His son ""Santino"" accidently said what he was thinking and Sollozzo and the Tattalgias knew that if Santino became the new Don that he would get the Corleone family involved. The whole conflict in this movie is caused because he refused an accommodation for the first time. It is also about how for the first time the other Mafia families have struck against the Corleone family and weakened them significantly. It is also about how the Corleone family makes a comeback, and takes back power and control in the end. A war breaks out between the two families it is the first challenge against the family and that is what makes the film so great. Another huge part of the story that makes the film so great is because it has a breaking Bad element in it. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is the youngest and most talented of the Corleone children, but he hates the fact that his family is nothing but a bunch of criminals and killers. He is a war hero, and a graduate of Dartmouth University, and he will probably become a really brilliant businessman. When his father gets shot he decides to help him and he ends up getting his jaw broken for it. He decides to kill Turk Sollozzo and the crooked cop who broke his jaw. From that point on the story becomes how he goes on to become the most powerful Don in the world. It is a fantastic movie. Michael Corleone is a brilliant man. He is smart, clever, and wise. He never makes a mistake. He plays people like puppets. That is why you see the puppets on the poster. He is much colder then his father. His father makes it less dark, but in the 2nd one when Marlon Brando wasn't in it the film was much more dark. This one is much more happy then the first one, because it isn's all of him. You still like him though, because he is brilliant. Another one of the best acting jobs in the film is James Caan's performance as Santino Corleone. He played him exactly as he was presented in the book. A hot-headed guy that would lose his temper all the time, and that famous temper did him in. He is intense, and impulsive. This was James Caan's best acting job of his career in my opinion. The film has many lines that have are used in our daily lives a lot now. Such as ""Sleeps with the fishes."" That is another way of saying that somebody is dead, and their body is at the bottom of the ocean. In the book the line is ""Luca Brasi is sleeping at the bottom of the ocean."" The film's dialog in awesome. It is mostly talking scenes, but the talking scenes are great. One of many things in this film that is perfect. The Godfather is an epic film that set the standard and formula for all other mafia films. This is the all time greatest guys movie. Based off of Mario Puzo's book of the same name, which is my favorite book too. Mario Puzo wrote the book and the screenplay for this phenomenal movie, that defines genius, and masterpiece. The film is dark, complicated, thought provoking, and hard to follow. I liked it the first time, but after I read the book and saw it again I thought it was absolutely incredible. It got better and better each time until I saw it for the fourth time. Since then it has just stayed just as good as it was the last time it got better. The movie is extremely similar to the book, because the screenplay was written by the author of the book Mario Puzo. But of course the book has more detail. Some of the details in the book that got cut out from the screenplay I am glad were cut out, like the stuff with Johnny Fontane with his ex wife after the incident with the director of the film he wanted to be in. Those were unnecessary details that I was glad they cut out. Certain things in the book that are better are scenes like when Michael Corleone kills the ""Turk"" and Captain McClusky. In the book it tells you what is going through his mind during the scene, and I remember I could not put the book down during that part. I always get distracted reading books for some reason, but I didn't with The Godfather. The movie is perfect, but unfortunately it can't tell certain details from the book. Another thing in the book that isn't in the first film is the story of how Veto Corleone became the head of the most powerful Mafia family in the world. But that was in the 2nd movie, so I was happy with that. Other then a few details left out from the book this movie was absolutely perfect.",positive
"My favorite movie of all time and if you like it ""Godfather II"" is also very good.",positive
Classic. Great character movie.,positive
"It's hard to believe that I had never watched The Godfather, as it is often referred to as one of the best (if not the best) films ever made, a superlative that makes it very difficult to evaluate it on its own merits. It is a singular film in how it changed the expectation of film for everything released after it, and it still stands up four decades after its release. Coppola's pensive direction lets scenes unfold, allows characters to exist, and forces the viewer to carefully observe and interact with every piece of information given on the screen, almost like a documentary. The movie is propelled by a number of incredible performances, primarily Brando and Pacino, but it's about more than the individuals: it's about the relationships between them and how we see how this family works through celebration and tragedy. The Godfather is a film about family, about America, about life, and about so much more, and it is certainly worth every superlative given its way.",positive
By the end of the movie you realize that you are routing for people that arent entirely good people. The film's freakin amazing!,positive
"Dear Sweet Jesus. I must be the only person on the planet who thinks this film is a boring, violent mess. Not only are the characters uninteresting and non relatable, but the plot is so massively dull, I actually had to pick it up a second time as I fell asleep halfway through the first time. Look. I don't care how artistic the camera angles are, or how there was symbolism in the guy's mustache or anything like that. For me, a movie has to be entertaining. Hence the term entertainment. If a movie puts me to sleep due to paint drying being a better viewing experience, it fails its job of granting escapism. And to me, that is the greatest offence a movie can make. And that is why I am granting this movie 1/2 of 5 stars. Because the stars themselves, fell asleep",negative
The opening scene is still one of my favorites today. It just perfectly sets the tone for the movie and tells you everything you need to know.,positive
One of the best American films of all time.,positive
Violent but Historical. Intrigued!,positive
classic movie excellent mafia film.,positive
Classic gangster film. Great story line and could watch over and over. All three of the film are 5 stars in my eyes. Classic :),positive
"Quite possibly the best film ever made If you have not seen it, please do yourself a favor and go see it NOW",positive
"This is the best movie of all time: story, production, acting and direction make this film worth watching over and over. Coppola here is better than David Lean in top form (I wish he was as consistent though). Marlon Brando's best performance. If you buy the DVD try to get the one with the director's comments.",positive
I believe the first is the BEST of them.,positive
Every scene is wracked with suspense and every performance were brilliant. A rich drama that comes with a very brutal commentary on American society.,positive
Violent but Historical. Intrigued!,positive
Does the world need another review of Copolla's masterpiece? I'm not thinking so.,positive
now officially my favorite movie,positive
finally watched this,positive
No explanation needed.,positive
Classic! One of the greatest films of all time.,positive
EXCELLENT MASTERPIECE!!,positive
I may be the only chick who loves it...but HEY!,positive
"One of the greatest movies of all time, an absolute classic that has and will be treasured by movie lovers for years. I struggle to find anyone that loves this movie, but if you haven't seen it, I demand you to watch it right now!",positive
Easily the most well cast movie of all time. Coppola's fantastically written and superbly acted masterpiece is a film that really makes you think. The Godfather comes full circle like no other movie before it.,positive
Gets better each time I watch it,positive
"I think in terms of stories, there are better ones, such as American Gangster or Scarface. Although this film clearly has a more serious tone to it than those two films, the story just doesn't seem to have quite the same trajectory. It is worth noting that it deals largely with the end of Vito Corleone's career and life as head of the crime family, rather than his rise to that position. This is probably where it differs most from the other two films that I rated so highly. Vito Corleone never comes across as this ferociousness mob boss who is to be feared, but rather a man with a strong moral compass who is to be respected. Marlon Brando gives an absolutely stellar performance here - matched only, in my opinion, by Daniel Day-Lewis' in There Will Be Blood. It is a shame Brando didn't get more screen time. On the other hand, I thought Pacino did a better job in Scarface, though he still provides a good supporting performance. I had read a lot about this film and its influence on cinema and with all the awards and acclaim it received I had high expectations. Coppola is undoubtedly great behind the camera here, but unfortunately the film falls short of my expectations. Nevertheless I give it a strong recommendation at 70%.",negative
"One of my favorite movies of all time, a loving look at an Italian-American dynasty.",positive
The best film ever made one of a kind film that it is not made to this standard any more,positive
"Godfather is one of few movies that never loses its appeal, no matter how much time you see it. It greatness doesn't lie in plot as much as it lies in perfect cast lead by breathtaking perfomance from Marlon Brando!",positive
the best of godfather trilogy,positive
"AMAZING!!!!!! Everyone needs to watch this movie. I thought I would hate this movie because I don't ""love"" mobster moves.",positive
"a classic, no no, masterpiece, of cinema. The Godfather is one of those rare movies that is just absolutely perfect in every aspect. I mean, literally everything is top-notch. When you have a cast that includes Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, etc., you've already made a powerful film. A story like this could've been the usual Mafia plot, but it chose to be more than that. I didn't expect Sunny to die halfway through the film. I didn't expect Al Pacino to turn cold. I have never seen better plotting in any other movie before. Copolla's direction is absolutely perfect as well, helping make this one of the best movies ever made, if not the best. With all of these things perfected in an unusually masterful way, it comes together to give arguably my favorite best picture winner ever. The Godfather must be viewed at least once in one's lifetime.",positive
"Greatest movie of all time, perhaps only surpassed by its sequel.",positive
I just couldn't force myself to see it. Watched 10 minutes and had to turn it off.,negative
"This film had a cultural impact that I may never understand, and my expectations going in (after hearing it was the perfect movie) may have been too high. What I saw was a good movie with great acting, great directing, okay writing and mediocre editing. Good? Yes. Best movie ever? Not in my opinion.",negative
I'm inspired to do evil thing to become part of a family like this.,positive
Very Enjoyable and keeps you interested throughout the entire movie. It is a great mix of everything a good film needs and doesn't Disappoint.,positive
"This is a classic. Excellent story, very well directed, outstandingly acted, and extremely well played out.",positive
"film taun 1972. a true beautiful masterpiece. ga nyangka ttg family bgt ternyata. Hands down for Marlon Brando, actingnya (^^)dddd",positive
"A genius plot with terrific acting, The Godfather is a must-see. The best film of the 1970s, maybe the entire 20th century.",positive
"What can I say, the greatest film of all time!",positive
"One of the best movies out there, just a great film",positive
"The original Coppola masterpiece is a force to be reckoned with. Riveting from the first frame, and never flags during its 3 hour running time.",positive
I think I don`t have to add anything too this movie which hasn´t been said yet. Just the cream of the top.,positive
"This film is an icon. There are so many great things about it it's difficult to write about it. Whether it be the gorgeous cinematography or the story of Michael's rise to the Don's chair, there's just too many brilliant things that make this movie one of the greatest of all time.",positive
epic movie...brando jz bow down...legend,positive
"It's easy to see why ""The Godfather"" is hailed as one of the greatest films of all time. Even for a movie as old as it is, it keeps you glued to the screen the whole way through. I was a couch-potato for three hours today. The performence by the cast is truly grand. I look forward to watching Part 2.",positive
If you don't like it you'll wake up with a horses head on your bed,positive
"Wow, this is filmmaking at it's best....",positive
"One can only describe this movie as perfection, there is certainly no need for exaggerated artistic interpretation to see that this flick is simply brilliant. The difficulty with this film is simply finding a scene that is even slightly enduring. No need for specifics, simply brilliant. 100%.",positive
One of the best overall casts of all time brings to life an epic novel. It's obvious why this film is considered one of the best of all time.,positive
"One of the greatest films ever made, the greatest gangster movie ever made",positive
Awesome....I sure enjoyed it,positive
Epic american masterpiece that is worthy of the #1 movie of all time,positive
A classic as referenced in the AFI top American films of all time (#2),positive
"The Godfather is the type of movie that makes people go to the movies. The Godfather features iconic characters, extremely good acting, and an epic story. Nearly every character in this movie from Marlon Brando to James Caan to John Cazale could be a good enough character to be the star in a different movie, but instead they are all in one movie. Legendary scenes such as the headless horse, to the door closing on Keaton at the end will be remembered respected and even parodied out of respect for many years to come.",positive

"Amazing. Anything I like about a film is put together in ""The Godfather""",positive
leave the gun. take the cannoli. i love cannoli.,positive
"A classic. I can't really bring anything new to the table, as everything has already been said, but I will say that this is an absolutely flawless film. Amazing performances, great direction and script, if you haven't seen The Godfather, see it. It's that simple.",positive
"Don't fall for the hype, this movie isn't as flawless as people make it out to be. For what it is, it's well made. There's great acting, and it was cool to see that these killers are also humans. But don't expect anything but one sullen, quiet tone for the whole 3 hours, and it's almost impossible to tell when the movie skips ahead in time, so many things will come off as confusingly rushed. For a movie that feels so slow, the important things move at a mile a minute, and the story doesn't stop to make sure you understand what you're looking at... It's just kind of going where it's going whether you you're coming along or not, so if you're a Tarantino type of guy, bring a notepad. Good movie, but not for everyone.",negative
"""The Godfather"" simply , is one of the greatest films of all time,this timeless Masterpiece made me wonder why i hadn't seen it earlier. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching ""The Godfather,"" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared.",positive
The god of all mafia films.,positive
I will make him an offer he can't refuse.,positive
Undeniably one of the best movies ever made,positive
You can act like a MAN!,positive
Would you believe it but thusly have just watched this for the 1st time! Fantastic and i've heard part 2 is as good..... Can't wait!,positive
Best Film EVer CReated (CREATED) but I like other movies besides like godfather 2,positive
"The Best Movie Ever Made. I didn't find anything wrong with this masterpiece. NOTHING. Its perfect. Nothing else to say in this review but, perfect. I can go on all day how The Godfarther is better then Citizen Kane but I wont. This is perfect. PERFECT. 100/100 A+",positive
"One of the most iconic films ever made, and an important part of modern culture. How it left such an impact can be seen in the film itself, such is the quality of it. The acting is top class. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are of course the strongest actors in this film, but even actors with smaller roles play it so well everyone comes off as a 3 dimensional character, even if they aren't a big a part of the movie. That's a triumph in my eyes. But Actors are only as good as the screenplay their acting out, and this film got an excellent one of those. Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola craft a detailed and engrossing epic of a story, with more memorable characters and line of dialogue than your brain can handle. But ultimately the thing that impressed me the most was the beautiful cinematography, the presence of which can be felt in every shot, to the extent where it begins to feel like its own character. Ultimately I could recommend this film, but it would be pointless. The film fan populace is split into those who've seen it, and those he are going to see it.",positive
Widely regarded as the best film ever.,positive
Just watched it for the second time. It gets better with each watch.,positive
One of the Greatest movies of all time.,positive
"Its an institute of film-making...! Its a LEGEND, my review doesn't matters. A person should watch it, to believe it..",positive
Still probably Francis Ford Coppolas greatest movie The Godfather depicts the gangster lifestyle in a dark and authentic way which takes this film head and shoulders above any other in its genre a true epic in every sense of the word.,positive

There's nothing to say. Everything in this movie is fantastic.,positive
"Acclaimed by critics and audiences alike as one of the greatest American films of all time and rightfully so, writer-director Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather stars Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, the head of a Mafia family whose youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) has just returned from the Marine Corps with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton). After a series of events occur such as an assassination attempt on Vito, Michael is reluctantly driven back into his family's business as he becomes prepared to take his father's place. For its impeccable writing, directing, and acting as well as for its captivating, unbiased look into the lives of people involved in the Mafia, The Godfather is an offer no film fanatic can refuse.",positive
Possibly the greatest American movie ever made.,positive
A great example of american cinema. Enough said.,positive
"I never want to jump on the bandwagon and give a film a full 5 star rating because everyone else is. But it's so hard not to with a masterpiece like the godfather. Just like it has been mentioned so many other times. The Godfather got everything right. If you can find a flaw that does not relate to the films pacing, please let me know. If the film is too slow for you because you are a major fan of non-stop explosives, or Michael Bay's pathetic way to tell a story with CGI, then I will not take your opinion into consideration if you tell me that its dialogue driven and tediously paced. But I do not see how anyone could consider such an epic to be dull or tiresome to sit through. It kept me entertained, and It still does every time I revisit it. What more can I say really... It actually did get everything right. From its casting choices, to its low contribution of continuity, there were no flaws that I could point out. Even having read the book, the screenplay was well thought-out, and the parts that were excluded from the book on the screen actually helped to the films advantage rather than the clichéd opposite. Of course the book is better and much more detailed, but what the book doesn't have is its advantage over its character work. Though all of the dialogue was in the book, until you actually see Marlon Brando or even Al Pacino's performances, you cannot understand just how epic this epic really is. A true epic, consists of three things: Contrasting characters, transformation in the characters (usually the main character), and patience performed by its story, and the directors use of pacing. Looking at the characters, there is a certain degree that the character undergoes. Good movies usually have character distinction, and most films fall flat because all of their characters are the same. The Godfather surpasses that element by giving each character great personalities, but seeing each and every one of them change by the end of the two hours. Of course that ability continues in the later installments, but if we see a relationship at the beginning of the film, that relationship between those people has changed drastically because of small decisions, and character development. On the note of patience, it is one of the hardest things to come by in films. Films like Goodfellas, Inception, or even 12 Angry Men are all great films for one simple reason. They jammed a lot of dialogue and ideas into such a short amount of time. A lot of studios seem to be on the fence about longer films. They are very skeptical, and it would be a shame to see major film studios turn to shorter films because they don't have the right material. That's where The Godfather succeeded the most. They used the three hour running time wisely. Francis Ford Coppola spends more enough time on the little details as well as the big picture while keeping the violence to a ultimate high and keeping the cast from killing each other. I could not depict which was harder, giving a new comer such as Francis Ford Coppola a job to direct one of the most groundbreaking epics in decades, or Francis Ford Coppola's job in general. I don't know how he succeeded, and I don't want to know. All I want to do is sit back and enjoy the groundbreaking film that they gave me.",positive
watched during the godfather thanksgiving weekend 2009.,positive
"A dramatic tale of mob life and how some are merciful, and others merciless. This is one of the greatest acted films ever made. Marlon Brando gives one of the greatest performances of all time, more than worthy of the oscar he won for it. Al Pacino was a great supporting character, as were James Caan and Robert Duvall. Talia Shire, Diane Keaton and all the rest also help to ensure that theres never a dull moment in The Godfather. It's also made astoundingly well with an Excellent soundtrack, intense cinematography and flawless film editing. The Godfather is surely an Unforgettable experience. One of the greatest films ever made.",positive
"The acting, the trama and the scenes all fit together to make a masterpiece",positive
"It was intense! I liked the horse head in his bed! Not my taste, but great acting.",positive
"The groundbreaking status this classic earned in its portrayal of the Mafia is by no means something to be taken for granted. Even the most amateur viewer can't deny that The Godfather's biggest strength lies in that field. Its depiction of the Mafia was unusually innovative, a sort of contrast to the groundbreaking innovation shown in Bonnie and Clyde five years earlier. I also firmly think that this classic garnered most of its strength from its characterization: and from that, its cast. And it wasn't just Marlon Brando or Al Pacino: the supporting cast gave two-thumbs-up performances as well. It was Al Pacino, however, who really astounded me. His performance as the passive-turned-aggressive Michael Corleone is just about the most startling character transition of its kind I've observed, excepting perhaps Kim Novak's role of Madeline-Judy in Vertigo. His reluctance at accepting his family's activities was very excellent, and his eventual retreat into his family's underhand violence was even more artistically so. Overall, I would say that in its top notch acting, The Godfather had its biggest asset. With an array of well playing actors like Pacino and Brando, this will undoubtedly be worthwhile to watch for any film fan.",positive
Nice movie movies-lover must watch it.,positive
Really an awesome movie! probably one of the greatest gangster movie! exellent performances by the cast especially Al pacino.,positive
"Incredible. For fans of the mafia genre like myself, it all starts here. Francis Ford Coppola makes a movie for the ages.",positive
"this is one of my favorite movies of all times, top 5 favorite of all time. the director does a fabulous job i love the acting and yes it is slow. but when i first saw it, i was afraid it was kinda boring, so i had to see it again, and i loved it. i love the meaning you get out of this movie, you have to pay attention and then you will understand it well",positive
"Simply the greatest american crime saga in the history of cinema. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are absolutely brilliant and the rest of the cast bring to life such an incredible story of family, violence, and loyalties. Francis Ford Coppola made an instant classic and it was even more incredible when the sequel surpassed the first and won the Academy Award for Best Picture as well.",positive
"Great performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and the rest of the cast. As well as the direction from Francis Ford Coppola.",positive
As near to if perfection as it is realistically possible to get. Everyone should watch this film at least once.,positive
It was a really amazing movie. I didn't expect this from such an old film coming from a teen like me. My friend recommended it to me so I thank him too.,positive
truly the greatest film in american history.,positive
I don't know why I love this movie a lot. I am a 00's generation but when I watched this movie... It stunned me. No other comment. Perfect!,positive
"So much work went into this movie. The sets, the extras, the acting, the filming, it's all fantastic. And what a story!",positive
"This film is a masterpiece. The plot, the music, the moments, the characters, the killings ... everything in this movie is absolutely perfect. That's all I've gotta say about this one and I totally recommend this crime epic for everyone. For those who does, then I'm gonna make you an offer you wouldn't refuse.",positive
"I can see the influence it's had on films but even looking at it as the movie it was at the time, it's just not the pinnacle of cinema that so many claim it to be.",positive
Every time I watch it I learn a new lesson in life :),positive
"The Godfather is flawless, a perfect film and maybe even my favorite. It breathes authenticity. From the suits, houses and cars to the way characters look, talk and handle situations. Puzo's book was full of juicy details that could easily translate to the big screen. But Coppola's ability to piece together those scenes and finding a way to humanize these mobsters is damn near shocking.",positive
Being hard and heavy to watch The Godfather never hits a single wrong chord. Top-notch cast delivers an exceptionally brilliant performance.,positive
"""The Godfather"" is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, ""The Godfather"" has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time.",positive
Spectacular mafioso classic,positive
This movie was simply a masterpiece finding a flaw in it is next to impossible! You could easily say this is one of the greatest films of all time if you haven't seen this American classic you simply must watch it!,positive

Does it really need a comment? Best mob movie of all time,positive
What can be said about The Godfather? It's perfect. Every single stinking aspect. A landmark of Cinema. It just doesn't get better.,positive
"With all the friction between Coppola and Paramount during the production of this movie, I'm genuinely surprised that they were able to come out with such a universally-adored classic. I just watched this movie again on Blu-Ray and let me tell you The Godfather has never looked better and the story is still just as powerful. Most people tend to put its 1974 sequel on a higher pedestal when comparing the two Best Picture winners but for me the original is where it's at. Watching Michael Corleone gradually transform from a good man who keeps away from his family's Mafia lifestyle to a cold and evil Don was much more engaging to me then what was to follow. Plus, Marlon Brando's take as Vito Corleone is probably one of the most iconic characters in Hollywood history and every scene he's in in this movie is truly outstanding. There's also something about the 1940s era and the self contained New York City story that appeals to me more than the more unrestrained and grandiose dual storylines of Part II. Don't get me wrong, both are still great films ...just the first one is better.",positive
"A masterpiece done by Coppola, so ahead of its time, everything about this movie is perfect",positive
I cant say anything about this movie that has not already been said. It is indeed a masterpiece.,positive
"If you don't like this movie, your not human!",positive
"Haven't seen this since I was a kid. A great movie, with a great cast, and well acted but it didn't ""wow"" me enough. I assume it's because I remembered or probably because I've seen so many references, parodies, etc. of many of the major scenes in this film my whole life that nothing really surprised me. The overall story though and Al Pacino's character progression from doll eyed outsider to the Godfather is what really makes this film.",positive
550....it should be one of the first to watch,positive
"Lavishing film. A wedding. A murder. Followed by more. A beautiful film revolving around the power and dignity of the italian-maifa, resembling such powerful characters with much to offer, it is a film which cannot be duplicated or recreated.",positive
"One of the greatest films I have seen. I loved it! Its acting, its cinematography, its story, its character, its music, everything of this movie is great. My favorite part of the story is how family is always more important than anything to the Corleones. Even when they do crimes, they have family values. It's also amazing how anyone can enjoy the movie. Is THE MOVIE. I really cannot see why not like it. Those people who don't like it, it's because they don't know how to appreciate it properly. There is always a possible way to enjoy this. The story, the music, the characters, lines, scenes. There is a lot to explore! The movie is really something pleasant to watch. You'll never regret watching this masterpiece. It will make you want to be a Corleone.",positive
You need me to tell you to see this?,positive
"Greatest moviemaking experience I will ever see! Based on the novel of Mario Puzo, The Godfather recalls the story of the Corleones in their height of power. Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the leader of the mafia crime family dealing with his children and trying to maintain peace with the other families. When he rejects an offer he gets shot. Now Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) takes the choice on taking it personal and taking down the people whom attempted the life on his father and starting an all out war between the five families. His brothers are not sure with this since Michael was not supposed to be involved with the movie in the first place. Now you wonder why is this greatest film ever made? The film is 3 hours long, and during those hours I wasn't bored. A film that can entertain me for 3 hours is something grand to look for. From the first scene to the last scene it captures your imagination, it keeps your interest, makes you wonder what's goanna happen next! The film makes it everything right. The art direction, the cinematography, the acting, the script, the story, the film has it all! It is composed by a great cast. Marlon's performance as the mafia boss is one of the performances that I will never forget in my life because it shows the sincerity of a man that is a bad person, but is really sympathetic. Al's performance as Michael is really dramatic because he tries his best to show his girlfriend that he is not like his family, even do he becomes like his family at the end of the film. We also got James Canaan, Robert Duvall, Deane Keaton and many more. What I like about this movie is the element of surprise. The first 20 minutes of this movie is really soft, a wedding reception scene, then Duvall's character is ordered to go to Hollywood to make a director to put Johnny Fontane in his movie. The director denies. Then the director wakes up with full of blood and we see that his horse's head was cut off. I think this is one of the scariest and memorable scenes of the movie because it shows the complexity of the characters, how can this movie surprises us when we least expect it. The soundtrack of this movie is pretty awesome because it holds you up to your skin. The soundtrack does its working on making every scene more memorable, especially at the climax of this movie at the final gun down. It will be an insult to say anything bad about this movie. The film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola whom is famous for the godfather trilogy and Apocalypse Now! The screenplay was made by both Puzo and Coppola, I think they did a masterpiece with this movie because it is so inspirational. The score was composed by Nino Rota which is famous for the song ""Speak Softly Love"" which received controversy for not receiving an Oscar nomination for best Original Song. The film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards which won three: Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor. Marlon Brando rejected his Oscar, one of the few actors to do it. The quote ""I'm goanna make him an offer he can't refuse"" is one #2 on 100 most memorable quotes. It is behind Citizen Kane, on the 100 Movies List on the American Film institute. If you like gangster movies then I recommend this film for you because it is the Don of gangster film, is a film to be enjoyed with its creativity and realism. If you are a frequent moviegoer then you should watch this movie because I believe it satisfies the appetite of all moviegoers. This is the type of movie to kids of 16 and up because the film is violent, not too violent, but the film is violent.",positive

'The Godfather' will make you an offer you will never refuse. I do not fathom to anyone who negatively criticize this movie. Probably they're blind.,positive
Talvez o melhor filme jÃ¡ feito.,positive
The Greatest film ever made!!,positive
Simply brilliant. It's impossible to describe in words how extraordinary this piece of art is.,positive
"Groundbreaking, touching, obviously a classic.",positive
Coppola directs a majestic Marlon Brandon creating the true essence of all that is told,positive
Un clásico de todos los tiempos que nadie se deberìa perder.,positive
"This movie is wonderful. Francis Ford Coppola is a great...no EXCELLENT director. Mario Puzo has a great vision for a movie as well as his novel which this movie is based off of. It also has a great cast, (I can't believe how young Talia Shire is!),but most importantly this is a masterpiece and is SHEER GENIUS!!! I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND WATCHING THIS. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! One of the greatest films ever made!!! Another fact is that Al Pacino is so CUTE in this movie!!! Love it!",positive
"definitely a classic, but i have to say, after all the hype i was expecting a bit more. brando was of course phenomenal, and the film looked beautiful - coppola's style was definitely evident. but beyond that, i couldn't get too into the plot or the characters - especially pacino as michael (did not like that casting choice at all). i would have liked to see more of the characters and their relationships, but felt overloaded with plot. maybe i'll feel different after a few viewings.",positive
"This film casts a particular kind of invisible spell that the unwary will always underrate. It is to create a world, and then make the audience believe that world is already there and the filmmaker simply filmed it. Since that is the highest goal of narrative filmmaking, and this film achieves it for nearly three hours, it deserves to be considered one of the best films ever made. In addition, the sound, music, atmosphere, acting, photography, and above all, the rhythm of this film is a rare kind of perfection. And when it's over one has the pleasure of two sequels which are also more than up to scratch.",positive
The greatest film ever made. The model movie that stands the test of time.,positive
"By making you sympathize with these cold hearted killers, The Godfather becomes a true masterwork of a film, one that is filled with moral and emotional depth that few films have reached.",positive
Call yourself a mob fan? Not if you haven't watch this.,positive
"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is an American classic and one of the greatest films ever made in cinematic history. It's a masterful and powerful inside look on the criminal underworld along with the characters and things that go along with it. Boasted by legendary performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, an excellent script, outstanding direction, and a smooth, soothing soundtrack. The true exception of the The Godfather, however, is that it has one of the most sophisticated and glamorous characters of all time. This is probably the best American film ever made, not to mention the best gangster story ever told.",positive
"The Godfather is considered worldwide as the greatest film of all time, and I completely agree. This film is such a masterpiece and is a perfect example of great film making, and I think all directors can learn something from Francis Ford Coppola and should follow in this great director's footsteps. There is nothing this film fails at, the script is flawless, the cast is marvelous, and the directing is the magic behind it all. This film was also the beginning to a marvelous trilogy of films that have made this into one of the best film series in cinema. The story is a poem of family, the mob, greed, and revenge which have been formed into this one epic gangster film. The characters are incredibly well written and we quickly figure out their personalities and decide if we like them or not, and as the film goes on our opinions change on the characters because we begin to realize they change or we get to know them better, which is what makes this film so fantastic. But what I think I love the most about this film is the characters of Vito and Michael Corleone, and the relationship between the, You can tell they indeed love each other, but Michael has never wanted in the family business. Vito has wanted it that way because he knows Michael is greater of better things, and this relationship shows the humanity in both of them and the love Vito has for his son. But this movie is also very dedicated to making this truly like the world of a mobster, and even at the time of the films release some known mobsters claimed the film was very realistic to what goes on in their world. The cast is incredible and may possibly be the greatest performances ever put into a film, and who steals the show is Marlon Brando. Marlon Brando plays one of the most memorable and fantastic performances of all time, his pure facial expressions deserved an Oscar. His character is so influential in a way, because even though he is a mob boss, we sense humanity in him and we realize this is a man who deeply cares for his wife and children, and Brando turns him into even more of a deeper character. Al Pacino has done some fantastic roles in his time, such as Scarface, Scent of a Woman, and even Dog Day Afternoon, but he will never be seen as anything in my eyes other than Michael Corleone. His performance is flawless, and in The Godfather Part II he somehow improves even more. His character is the drive of the trilogy, its the tale of him losing his humanity in the world of mobsters, and his ultimate downfall and demise that comes from all this. This film is what started this journey, and Al Pacino plays him incredibly to the end, and just the way he changes from the start of the film to the end should show you how great of an actor Pacino is. James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, and Diane Keaton were all perfect in their roles and contributed to making this the greatest film of all time. What can I really say about this flawless film that has not already been said? For over 30 years it has been a worldwide masterpiece and loved by all true film lovers, and I think its safe to say that if you hate this film than you should not be allowed to ever watch another movie. Not only is this one of my favorite films, but if you me what the greatest film of all time if, then the first thing that would pop into my head is this incredible masterpiece.",positive
"What makes The Godfather a good film is the brilliant plot and compelling characters. What makes it a great film is the fact that, despite the long running time, audiences are completely captivated scene-to-scene until the movie's finale. This is true cinema.",positive
"Cinematic glory. The cinematography, characterization, the acting (Pacino, Brando, and Caan), and the storyline are all done right in explicit detail, also the musical scores, therefore it steadfastly lacks any such flaw and deserved the three Academy Awards (one for Best Picture). I can't even believe how it also enthralled the real-life gangsters into changing speech patterns closer to that of the character Vito's and for portraying the criminal underworld as the most accurate possible.",positive
There isn't much that can be said about this film that hasn't already been said. It's a perfect movie.,positive
".....just watched AGAIN last week. Arguably the best motion picture ever made. Template for how story and character SHOULD unfold and be revealed in a story. Never seen a film since where EVERY CHARACTER is so complete and fleshed out and complex. Watching the evolution of Michael Corleone alone is worth the investment of time. If you have NEVER seen this, you can't be a legitimate film 'buff'.",positive
"It's a great film plain and simple. Has to be one of the best films ever made, it's hard to even find a fault with it! If you have NOT seen this film then I recommend that you watch it straight away.",positive
"Time and time again I have tried to find out what made 'The Godfather' so perfect and I finally realized that it's the ability of it's makers to be efficient, yet personal; to evoke passion, anger and mysticism and most important of all, reveal to the viewer the sheer power of cinema at it's absolute finest.",positive
"I don't know where to start with this movie other then one word ""PERFECT"" godfather gets everything right lets not forget Brando's performance as well Pacino's which this movie really made him famous.",positive
Is there any debate here.,positive
"Brilliant plot. I love the Italian Mafia; they way they approach problems. Michael was the best. The plot was engaging and whenever there was a climax, there was great tension after. The actors played their best. Ludicrously engaging.",positive
one of the best ever,positive
i think its starts out slow but then gradually climbs up to really interesting to watch. The parts with al pacino were really well acted on his part and great to see,negative
The Greatest achievement in cinematic history,positive
so big esteemed fan of this movie,positive
"a very well made and acted, and written, movie, about mafia",positive
"Probably the best film ever made, plus is equalled by its sequel. a film masterpiece.",positive
"Ok, I finally saw it. Yes, it is a perfect movie.",positive
Unbelievable piece of cinematic magic and perfection.,positive
This was an excellent film.,positive
Just a genius like Coppola could do an epic movie like this!,positive
"Having long been among my favorite films (along with Godfather II), I wanted to experience Coppola's masterful trilogy on blu ray. Rightfully entitled the Coppola Restoration, the blu ray gets a unique treatment, trying to make it look as close to how it looked theatrically as possible, and it's a brilliant transfer, gaining a much better clarity, definition, and contrast than the DVD version. There's nothing one can say about the film itself that hasn't already been said, it's masterful and perfect on every level, and certainly ranks right along with part II as among the best films ever made. Fans of the series who want to experience it as the filmmaker's had truly intended it to be need to definitely check out the blu ray.",positive
fucking incredible. Brando's 2nd best film. Coppola's 3d best.,positive
"The Godfather is no doubt one of the greatest movies ever and has a great story with a excellent cast. The Godfather is about the Corleone family who have an organized crime group with their leader ""The Godfather"" or ""Don"". Michael Corleone returns home after he becomes a war hero from WWII and goes to his sister's wedding. A few months later his Don Vito Corleone (AKA The Godfather) is hot many times after he refused to give them political connection. After that happens Michael soon goes on to be in the family business with his brothers and his father, soon many events go on were Michael and his family have to take on. This is known to be one of the best movies ever made and possibly the best movie ever made and it's true. Francis Ford Coppola brings this novel by Mario Puzo to the big screen and turns it into a masterpiece. This is such a strong movie because you get so caught up with the Corleone family and whats going and soon thats all you can think about. I've always loved crime movies and gangster movies and this is among one of the greatest ever made and one of the most memorable. This movie has many memorable scenes and quotes that shall be remembered throughout time. This movie also has some of the best acting in film history. Marlon Brando gives a knockout performance as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino gives one of his greatest performances as he's just starting of his career as an actor. There are also great performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, and everyone else in this film. The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made with no flaws and if you haven't seen it yet what are you doing reading this, get your butt up and go watch it.",positive
It's The Godfather. Enough Said.,positive
"One of the greatest films of all time. Absolutely fantastic film, unbeatable.",positive
"Think of all the things that make a film great and you've got them in The Godfather. This is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece and a film rightfully considered one of the best of all time. Marlon Brando not only plays the character of Don Vito Corleone, he creates and defines him. It's truly a remarkable and iconic performance, and one which rightfully gave him his second Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino too gives an outstanding performance has the Don's son, Michael Corleone. The Godfather has become an iconic film of American cinema, and rightfully so, it not only delivers a wonderfully written story, but it presents timeless characters, a memorable musical score and recreates the world of post-war America as we see it through the Corleone family. There is an abundance of classic scenes and famous lines such as ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" or ""leave the gun. Take the cannoli"". There are so many things that can be praised about this film. The Godfather is a true and deserving classic of American cinema.",positive
Fantastic film but you don't need me to tell you that. Marlon Brando is great.,positive
"This film is in my top ten favourite films of mine, it's also one of the greatest films ever,period. This film gets everything right and it has no faults.The The acting is superb and the tone of the film is gritty and unrelentingly dark. The story of this film involves a well-crafted storyline that I'm not going to say anything about because I want you to go watch this without know anything about it. It's one of my favourites. It's emotionally complex with subtle hints that even the don himself as a heart and a conscience.",positive
I'll make you an offer you can refuse. Watch the Godfather...or die.,positive
"This movie really is robably the best movie in histry. An amazing story and very well filmed, acted out, directed, etc. This movie is truly amazing to watch.",positive
"""AMERICAN CLASSIC"" The Godfather is for sure the best and the perfect Mafia film that anyone would ever ask for..The main power of the film lies on how REALITY it looks to you..It show with so much reality thanks to the superb performance from the two leads..It a definite benchmark",positive
"Bueno, que decir... es un clasico... ya no hacen peliculas como estas...",positive
Greatest mob movie ever. It is the standard that all other mob movies are held to. In fact The Godfather could be the greatest movie ever made.,positive
One of the originators of great Gangster flicks and one of my favorite of all time. Reading the book was great too.,positive
"Reviewing a production as profound as The Godfather is a great pleasure and also an exercise in futility. Those who haven't seen the film aren't likely to rush out and grab a copy based solely on my affectionate analysis, and long-time fans shouldn't need additional prodding. As such, I'll leave the rigorous debating to the film historians, and simply focus on the success of the film, as well as my personal opinion on its relevance. Last year, I went on a 26-mile backpacking trip with a group of six friends with a variety of backgrounds. One of the guys in the group was raised without a television, and spent the better part of his 20's catching up on everything he missed in his childhood. As an outdoor lover, I find it hard to criticize anyone who chose to promote physical activity rather than sitting in front of the television, so despite the shock of a television-free childhood, I could understand his parents reasoning. What I couldn't understand, is how he managed to dig into everything under the sun during the past 12 years, and never take the time to watch The Godfather trilogy. He earned his fair share of group chasitising while the rest of us praised Coppola's cinematic gems, and eventually promised to watch the films back-to-back during the inevitable recovery period at the conclusion of our trip. Whether or not he followed through is irrelevant, but our group discussion of The Godfather brought two things to light. First, I've never stumbled across another film series with such a loyal following. If you walk down the street and ask ten people if they've seen The Godfather, I'd imagine nine of them will say yes. Second, everyone who views the film will come away with a different analysis of what makes it so profound. Coppola didn't simply make an entertaining film; he made a masterpeice with limitless appeal. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is a well-respected leader among the Italian-American community. Hidden beneath the exterior of a businessman in the olive oil trade, Vito is a charming dictator with his hands in a variety of legitimate and criminal ventures. One day, the Corleone patriarch is approached by the representative of a rival family with a request for assistance in a profitable narcotics venture, which Vito refuses. This sets off a tragic war between the two families, and eventually leads to a leadership transfer from Vito to his son Michael (Al Pacino). Michael is a well-educated young man with conflicting ambitions. On the one hand, he wants to legitimize the family business and escape the violent world of organized crime. However, he soon realizes the rival families are out to ruin the Corleone family, and intend to remove the head of the organization in order to cripple the body. With a constant target on his back, Michael is forced down a crash-course on betrayal and deception, as he furiously battles to protect everything his father built",positive
Coppola's masterpiece....one of the ten best movies ever.,positive
The Greatest film of all time.,positive
"I probably would have enjoyed this more in one sitting, but it's hard to do with a movie this long...not sure how I'm going to fit in the longer sequel. While a dark and arguably depressing story, the relationships depicted between members of the Corleone family is very well done, and is the only bit of light that the film shares. While I don't see the darkness as being promulgated by the film, it does make the film hard to ""enjoy,"" beyond it's good storytelling.",positive
My review for this movie: IT'S THE F***ING GODFATHER.,positive
"The Godfather is one of the best movie ever made. Everything about this movie is incredible. The performance the Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give are hauntingly fantastic. Every time i watch it, it gets better and better each time. I have to say, my favorite movie of all time.",positive
"One of my favorite movies of all time. This has everything--drama, suspense, action and plenty of spectacular acting. A definite must see!",positive
"One of the best movies of all time, both with its solid history as their characters. The film never falls into boring (except some scenes from the wedding), almost all deaths are memorable, is interesting from the beginning, and the character of Don Vito Corleone is incredible throughout the film, the ending is one of the best I've seen, the multiple deaths and see the end to Al Pacino taking the place of Don Vito Corleone is incredible. As far as music is defended well, they are very good and the main piece is memorable.",positive
"""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse."" One of the best films in cinematic history. It took me forever to write this review because I wanted it to be perfect. Not because I lied about seeing it because I did see it. I don't even know where to start with this one. I'll start by saying that this is near perfection. It has very little flaws. Everything is good the acting, writing, and directing. The writing is super. The one liners to the long conversations are really good. The acting was also really good. The casting was a very well done job. Al Pacino was perfect for the role of the son. He was also a complex character. At the start you are introduced to him having good morals and values then everything changes. Marlon Brando is the perfect actor to play the Don considering that he is one of the best actors of all time. Why wouldn't he accept his awards at the Oscars? Moving along, the directing was really good considering it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The best part has to be the plot. It's an awsome story about family, but that doesn't mean that it's a family film. Other noble mentions include the cinematography and costume design. The original music was also entertaining. The main theme song is going to be my wedding and funeral song. Can you imagine the coffin being carried and hearing the Godfather theme song. There's just aren't going to be any mobsters at my funeral. Unless if they want to come. Well that's the end of this review so I'm going to go watch part 2 and part 3 now.",positive
So glad I finally watched this,positive
Timeless masterpiece,positive
"I've probably seen this movie 30 times. Every time it's on TV, regardless of whatever else I was watching, I will switch to this movie and watch the rest of it. An example of perfect movie making!",positive

"Classic American cinema, The Godfather is a total and complete masterpiece that has transcended from generation to generation.",positive
"Marlon Brando puts everyone to shame! I can see why this tops the movie list still to this day. The entire movie feels very modern. Great, great great direction, effects, acting, scenery.. it's just the storyline I'm not crazy about. Either way, it's good stuff.",positive
A classic movie of crime and love that is one of the best movies ever. This was a trendsetting film that will not be forgotten.,positive
"The movie is so rich. It is so much more than just a gangster movie. The plot and the characters are all so well developed, and have so much meaning and story behind each and every one of them. I had watched it once and didn't think much of it. I gave it another chance and was blown away. I have to repeat myself. This movie is so much more than a gangster movie. It is so rich and meaningful. The gangster imagery and dress is just the surface level for a resounding story true that is true to America.",positive
"An important film for filmmaking, THE GODFATHER stands as a film with rich characters, a powerful story arc, and some of the best scenes in film history.",positive
One who hasn't seen this is missing half of his/her life.,positive
"- My favourite film, and perhaps the greatest movie of all-time. I love it and enjoy it just as much each and every time I watch it. Looks fantastic on blu-ray! - Just rewatched it for the first time in years and in a theatre no less. This is my ALL-TIME favourite film, I love every aspect of the film from the story, to acting, to the outstanding score. There are so many individual moments that stand out, and for a movie that is 3hrs, not a second of it was dull. I really hope Coppola has one more film left in him like this... The movie is perfection to me.",positive

"If you ever want to call yourself a movie buff, you first have to watch The Godfather, one of the most critically acclaimed movies of all time. I never realized how many scenes from this movie have been parodied in other works of entertainment. The Simpsons alone has parodied scenes from it several times. Its effects on pop culture aside, the film was a true masterpiece. Unlike Goodfellas, this film about organized crime actually had sympathetic characters. I think it's a good thing when a picture can get you to root for a bad guy. And even if you don't like mafia stories, this film still has love stories and lots of drama, so it has something in it almost anyone can enjoy.",positive
more than a film philosophy religion guide and much more,positive
"The Best Movie of all time! if you ask me what is the limitation of this movie, it is simply NOTHING!. The Cast, Director, Cinematography, and The Script Just amazing!. This movie could captured the dramatization and the experience of Mafia world. This is the one and only movie that makes me feel that I'm part of it, like I'm in it. Feels like I'm part of the Corleone family. 5 complete stars is what this movie is worth! Breathtakingly and elegantly Great!",positive
Rien à dire. Parfait.,positive
"The Godfather is incredible. Every performance is great, but Brando is spot-on. He is 'The Godfather', the man with the plan, and most importantly, is the character that you root for toward the end.",positive
May very well be the best movie ever made.,positive
Masterpiece about organized crime and family bond.,positive
Best movie in the History of Cinema,positive
"It's hard to review this classic on this site but I will say this: if anyone asks me why I love movies I provide them with two words: 'The Godfather'. Coppola, Pacino, Brando, Willis et al - with a cast and team of artists like that can anyone even believe it is anything but great? More importantly is that the movie is far more complex and brilliant than even expectations that are high for the movie can imagine. This is a movie of unbelievable genius and of Shakespearian tragedy (i.e.: complex family relations, betrayal, loyalty, family conflicts, etc.), so this is not your average movie, 'The Godfather' enters high art.",positive
"Better late than never, has aged slightly but definitely a masterpiece.",positive
"100% PERFECTION OF DRAMA. AMAZING ""BEST-PICTURE"" ACADEMY AWARD WINNER. AWESOMETACULAR.",positive
Brilliant Plot and brilliantly executed.,positive

it's a good story but goes on way too long and by the end i was eager to turn it off so i could say ok i saw the godfather but it is not the best film ever still i respect it but in my eyes copollas masterpeice remains apocalypser now in my eyes,positive
the godfather is a movie that can't be beaten or compared what else is there to say,positive
classic. beautiful. PERFECT,positive
"Remains a fabulous piece of ensemble acting, and a genuinely virtuoso piece of filmmaking. Completely faultless, cinema as close to perfection as you could hope to see.",positive
"A classic. Must see! Epic soundtrack, great dialogue, masterly preformances from everyone involved.",positive
A brilliant masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola and an instant classic. The performances of the ensemble cast are one the best there has ever been. The portrayal of a family that just wants whats best for each other and do whatever to achieve that is the dream of every parent but they got there the wrong way. Plus Al Pacino's decent into darkness is flawless. My Favorite gangster film and a benchmark in quality for world cinema. We need more films like this one.,positive
"There are a few films that revolutionized cinema history, this is one of them. Phenomenal, edgy, refined, and enthralling from beginning to end, Godfather remains to be quite possibly one of the best, and highest critically-acclaimed American films ever made.",positive
Great film with very few flaws.,positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by this gangster epic. Brilliant acting, particularly Brando.",positive
Best American movie every made.,positive
One of the best movies I ever watched. I just don't understand why there are some people that against this movie. i wonder what kind of movies they watch.,positive

The Greatest of all time,positive
Probably the biggest achievement in movie history,positive
"It isn't wise to call this film anything other than ""perfect, amazing, perfect, gripping, well-done, perfect.."" But I wouldn't call this one of my favorites only due to the fact that it's literally everybody's favorite crime/movie of all time. Saying The Godfather is a good movie is like saying Jesus was a good man; it's absolutely true in every regard. I still enjoy it when it comes on TV, even though I, and my sweet Italian grandmother, have seen it well over 100 times.",positive
"""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse."" Simply put, an American classic.",positive

"The Godfather is #2 on the American Film Institute's Top 100 and with good reason. The characters are unforgettable and their development contributes to the emotional element of the film. The plot builds and holds the attention of the viewer throughout. If you ever thought that The Godfather was just another mafia movie (I admit I thought this may be the case before seeing it), you are mistaken.",positive
No other movie can live up to this one!,positive
"One of the best all time greatest films ever, period!!",positive
Francis Ford Coppola's greatest achievement in this crime family epic.,positive
"Humanizes gangsters for its time, this film is electric throughout, never a dull moment, but unlike many of those movies, its isn't terribly tiring, nor are there any characters to hate, all likable or sympathetic, the acts of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall really take this movie where it deserves to be, on the throne of gangster films.",positive
Perhaps the ultimate mafia film with the best possible cast.,positive
"What can I say. It's The Godfather and while it's not by no means a perfect movie, it's still a damn good one. It just has that charm that still allows Mafias to operate even in the 21th century. The characters are good, the plot jumps around a bit but not too much, the atmosphere is definitely Sicilian... It's The Godfather.",positive
One of the best movies ever made!,positive
One of the greatest of all time.. every dude should watch this! Unparalleled acting by all the casts,positive

"One of America's greatest Motion Picture. The film gets everything right, from directing to acting, from writing to cinematography, and it is also suported by Nino Rota's haunting score. The Godfather is an icon of world's cinema and could be possibly the best acted film of all-time [5/5]",positive

After all this time I finally watched it. I was not disappointed. Absolutely fabulous. Intense delivery by entire cast; very engaging. So good it didn't even feel like three hours.,positive
"Good movie, overrated though.",negative
"I happen to enjoy this one more than part 2. It's leaner, and the narrative has a tighter, more hypnotic pull. Not to mention, so many moments are examples of a filmmaker in peak form: the opening wedding, the murders at the restaurant, the baptism massacre; all these moments, along w/ a peerless cast and rich subtext, solidify its status as an absolute masterpiece.... The iconic score, however, while evocative, is merely a really good thing in a film of masterful things.",positive
"One of the best movies of all time, it has great acting, screenplay, casting, and more! This movie is the Godfather of all drama movies ever made, it's combination of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan makes this a masterpiece of of all movie history.",positive

"""Le parrain"" fait partie de cette variete de films dont on sait, sans meme les avoir vu, qu'ils sont des chefs d'oeuvre...mais dont on aurait de toute facon pense la meme chose dans le cas contraire. Il fait aussi partie de ceux qu'on revoit au fil des annees sans que jamais ils ne perdent une once de leur superbe, alors que les modes, les representations, le ton et les structures filmiques s'imposent, vivent et disparaissent. On peut fournir des explications tres prosaiques a ce phenomene : Alpha et omega du film de mafia, ""Le parrain"" a offert les prestations inoubliables de deux des plus grands acteurs de l'histoire (sans compter d'innombrables seconds roles tout aussi marquants), les innombrables citations mythiques qui en ont ete tirees et font aujourd'hui partie de l'inconscient collectif l'ont dote d'une stature referentielle avec lequel seul ""Star Wars"", dans un autre registre, est peut-etre en mesure de rivaliser. Et sa portee culturelle fut telle qu'aucun film de mafia ulterieur ne put esquiver (ni soutenir) la comparaison avec lui. Pourtant, s'il n'avait ete qu'un simple film de gangsters, regorgeant de rivalites claniques et de meurtres sordides, ""Le parrain"" ne beneficierait plus aujourd'hui d'une telle aura, et serait tout au plus considere comme un charmant ancetre, dont la violence passerait pratiquement inapercue. Le film de Coppola allait beaucoup plus loin que ne l'exigeaient les codes de l'epoque. On lui accola nombre de titres au fil du temps, ceux d'""Opera"" ou de ""Tragedie grecque"" etant les plus fameux. Car ""Le parrain"" est avant tout une histoire d'hommes pris dans un engrenage inextricable entre leur loyaute familiale et leur volonte de mener leur propre vie, entre l'amour et les obligations, entre la diplomatie et la guerre. Un recit universel et intemporel, narre avec une telle maestria et un tel sens du mythe qu'il transforma ce projet dont tout le monde se mefiait en chef d'oeuvre de l'histoire du cinzma.",positive

He is my inspiration...,positive
one of the best movies ever... 3 hours of continues thrilling and perfect acting,positive
Every aspect of this film resonates quality.,positive
"Yeah people say this move is really slow paced, but I disagree. The pace of the movie, and the movie itself is actually perfect. I can't stress how much I love this movie and how much I appreciated it watching it a 2nd time. Michael's transformation is just fucking great, and there's obviously one of the best casts ever assembled in this movie. I can't find one flaw in it. It's almost 3 hours long but it really never got boring to me. I know it's typical, but I can seriously see why this is considered one of the best movies ever made. It really fucking is.",positive
"I am not a fan of mafia movies in the slightest. Reguardless of how well the star cast acted in this movie, to me it was completely overrated and needs to be dropped.",negative
one of the best movies ever made. good show!,positive
"The time is 2:45 am-- it is Monday the fifth of September, 2011-- and I have just watched Francis Ford Coppola's ""The GodFather"" for the first time. From the opening sequence to the very last frame, never once will you doubt that your watching a classic, purely rooted in American cinema. I can tell you now, without a doubt, that I have never seen a movie make all the right moves like this one has. The acting, writing, shot choice, lighting, set pieces, score, direction, sound, and even the editing all woven together so brilliantly that you forget about the screen and let it sweep you into escapism. For those of you who think this movie is three hours of Brando talking with cotton balls in his mouth, I can assure you that it's a little more complicated than that. And thankfully, Marlon Brando's often parodied voice isn't diluted in the slightest due to an oscar (no, thank you) winning performance. Al Pacino is so towering in his role here, which I won't spoil for anyone, that it's hard not to bow your head whenever he comes into frame. The movie keeps you guessing, and always finds a way to surprise your expectations with originality and clever trickery. I could go on and on to do more injustice to this film, but just go out by telling you that this movie is gonna make you an offer that you can't refuse. So don't.",positive
"A terrific movie about family, power, and respect. Perfect balance of violence and tenderness. Minus half a star for being slightly slow paced at times.",positive
What a classic. One of the greatest story's I've ever been blessed to see hahaha. Brando was spellbinding. And Pacino was amazing even though it was still his early stage in acting!,positive
"epic,legendry,spectacular,class etc etc the more u see it the more u wanna watch it!!best films ever made, hats off to francis ford coppola.",positive
One of the most acclaimed and famous films to ever come out of hollywood. And one of the best films of the new hollywood era which started about 1967 with movies like the graduate starring dustin hoffman and bonny and clyde starring warren beatty and faye dunaway. The godfather won 3 1972 oscars including best picture best screenplay for francis ford coppola and mario puzo and best actor for marlon brando.,positive
It is safe to say that The Godfather is one of the best movies of all time.,positive
"L'interpretazione di Marlon Brando Ã¨ spettacolare, ma la bravura di Al Pacino si nota anch'essa. Poi la mano del grande Francis Ford Coppola Ã¨ stata premmiata con tre Oscar, sebbene come Miglior Regi sia stata conferita solo la nomination",positive
"One of the best, if not THE best, movie of all time. Featuring perfect performances from everyone in the cast, especially the late, great Marlon Brando and the young Al Pacino.",positive
Classic. Never gets old!,positive
"so I finally saw it and though remarkable in cinematic technique and with some amazing performances by Brando and Pacino, it failed to touch me.",negative
"the cast is wonderful the script is great and so the directing. Personally I stayed up untill 3 to watch all the godfathers day after day. The movie just gives you something that others don't. You become obsessed with it in a way you don't get usually after watching a film. This is one, if not the best movie i've ever seen in my life.",positive
"Somehow it took me so many years to see this classic, and I must say I'm not as ecstatic about it as most of the people who have seen it. The story is indeed highly absorbing, the acting is at the peek of Oscar-winning level (especially good old Marlon Brando), the possibility to see the mob mechanics behind the scenes is just as engaging as it could be, but... I guess I just missed the pace that contemporary movies used us to, and the old movies, including classics, just don't have it anymore for me.",negative
"AMAZING, maybe the greatest movie ever made",positive
Classic. End of story.,positive
Best movie of all time,positive
Even though it's really long I liked it. It's very slow paced,positive
"leave the gun, take the cannolis, and watch this film. it's great action, acting, and historical perspective on the mafia.",positive
"The rarest of movies where the drama, the cast, their acting, the direction, the screenplay all are surrealistically perfect. Watched it almost 100 times in my 25 year life time and did not find any movie near to this perfection. I ended up watching these many times just to deeply get into every character. Its a waste of a life having not seen this movie.",positive

"Quite simply, this is one of the finest films ever made. There is not a single moment of The Godfather that is not a marvelous work of art. The transformation of Michael is remarkable, as he goes from the gentle, harmless son returning home for his sister's wedding, to the ruthless, cunning figure he is destined to be later on. This film is a masterpiece that defines the film-making industry. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie and absorb every frame.",positive

One of the greatest masterpieces of movie film history.A must see on any ones list.,positive
"It is a long film. The storytelling is very strong, and Brando, Pacino, and Duvall all do fantastic jobs on their roles. This is the original gangster movie. There are so many ideas in this movie that have inspired parodies and so many other cultural references. Watching this one screams CLASSIC.",positive
"Well I have finally seen the so called ""greatest movie of all time"" and I have to say I am a bit disappointed. Now I understand why this film is regarded as a classic but the subject of the film just doesn't intrigue me (I never really liked gangster movies), it was a bit too long, and I didn't feel emotionally attached to the characters. Though I will say that Pacino's and Brando's performances were excellent. So by no means am I saying that this movie is bad it's just a bit overrated in my opinion.",negative
"""I believe in America"". And I believe The Godfather is the American zeitgeist, a lens through which we can see and know ourselves, good or bad. As essential to American culture as baseball or automobiles.",positive
"One of the most boring films ever made, I wonder how it has stayed so popular with wannabe gangsters for so many years. Now this is not just the ""girl"" speaking in me, because I know plenty of women who genuinely love this movie, but how much testosterone can you fit on one screen? The only reason this film has one star is because the acting in it is good, but what would you expect from such a cast? One of the most overrated movies in the history of cinema.",negative

"oscarclub.wordpress.com Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall & Diane Keaton It was always business. The murders, the deceit, revenge, the lot. Nothing personal. No one betrays the family, not even a family member. This film combines a brilliant screenplay and incredible performances with an intriguing story. I don't know anyone who isn't fascinated by mafia movies. Full of overt violence, they are not easy to watch and this one is no different. It all begins with a wedding. Don Vito Corleone's (Brando) only daughter is getting married. Here we meet the main players in the Corleone gang: sons - Sonny Coreleone (Caan), Michael (Pacino) & Fredo, Consigliere and adopted son, Tom Hagen (Duval), famous singer Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and many other thugs and bodyguards. Everyone is there. Drama strikes when a Drug Lord demands protection from the Corleone family which Don Vito refuses in no uncertain terms. Drug Lord gets cranky, pins an arm and shoots a few, then, my friends, it is on! The Don himself does not escape gunfire and ends up in hospital. Reluctant mobster Michael is then drawn into the family business by the attack on his ole papa. More action with bloody consequences and Michael is shipped off to Sicily where he falls in love and more action happens (you really must see it to believe it). There's more bloodshed on the streets of New York City and surrounding boroughs as the depth of police corruption and family betrayals are uncovered. The Don regains control and meets with the heads of the five families to work out a truce. A kind of peace reigns once again. But for how long? Michael returns and takes over the family business, heads to Vegas and wheels and deals. Another death occurs (can you believe it?) and blood, once again, flows. This is a serious film. Not once does Pacino or Brando crack a smile. They deliver powerful and honest performances that keep you glued to the screen. They are simply mesmerising. In fact all the performances are flawless. But Brando was the only actor to win an Oscar and he famously refused it (see http://oscarclub.wordpress.com/2011/07/25/native-american-indians-in-film/). The Godfather film is based on the novel with the same name by Mario Puzo. He used the five real mafia families of New York City as a basis for his story. The character of Johnny Fontane was believed to be based Frank Sinatra, who was wildly upset by this. Was it, then, a historical novel? The first Godfather film has been hailed by many as one of the best films of all time. So if you haven't seen it, you need to. Don't forget to let us know what you think. 'The Godfather' Trivia: * Budget - A cool $6.5 million * Director Francis Ford Coppola didn't want to glorify the mafia, so he decided to make this film as a metaphor for capitalist America. * Paramount didn't approve of Coppola's casting of Brando. Instead they thought Ernest Borgnine would be more suitable. Ba-bow! * At the time Pacino was an unknown - an unpopular choice but ultimately a wise one. * Coppola's sister, Talia played Connie Coreleone, his wife was an extra and his, now famous, daughter Sofia was the baby in the baptism near the end of the film. * Brando wore a mouthpiece especially designed for him by a dentist * A real horse's head is used in the infamous bed scene. Actor John Marley was not aware it was going to be real so his screams in this scene are genuine. * When the Don is carried up the stairs, Brando added more weight to his bed as a joke on his co-stars. * Food and drink are featured in 61 scenes of this film. I think I should have been born Italian. * Brando copied the gravelly voice of a real mob boss, Frank Costello. * Coppola based a lot of the characters on members of his own family... eeeek * Pacino's heritage is in a Sicilian town called Corleone ... sound familiar? * For some reason Oranges feature heavily throughout this film * 18 characters die",positive

One of my favorites film,positive
This was a great movie....The story brought life mainly to show the lifestyle of this godfather family. It was interesting to see how these kind of business happen..I mean what the family has to pay what they have to keep in mind...how you cannot really trust someone...,positive
"after nagging and nagging and nagging and all the 'omg u haven't seen the godfathers!' I've finally embarked on this trilogy the first may, no forget that IS too old for me and i mainly found it boring and generally not interesting and hard to follow, the parts that saved it for me where the brutal killings and action etc, the only character i reli enjoyed 2 watch was the godfather himself",negative
"The Godfather is personally my favorite movie. All of the elements in the movie combine to make a true classic. Francis Ford Coppola is a genius. Not only is the directing great, but the actors truely play their part to a T. The music is also extremely captivating. Overall, the best movie ever made.",positive
"To review something seems at first a simple job. You are offered something up, in the form of a dish, a painting or a film, any art form. Next you use two skills which most Human beings posses, thinking and writing. You then just write about what you think of it. Unfortunately it is not as easy as it seems, not quite paid to eat, it is a hard difficult intellectual process. Comparing and analysing every last detail you see before writing another art form. This is topped off by the fact that no reviewer is allowed to like something and then next week not like something there must be a clear pattern. But there is hope. The Godfather. It is a film that cannot be explained in beautiful shakespearian language but just can be said one of the best films in history. This is where the reviewer may take a break and just say with a sense of knowing and fact that everyone agrees on. Everyone has a feeling that this is the best film in the world. And if everyone has the same sure feeling then it must be right. ***** 5 Star",positive
"Watched ""The Godfather"" last night, for the first time since Zeus knows when. I was quite impressed by the fact that it did not try and ram exposition down the viewer's throat. Many plot details are implied, while considerable time is spent in scenes with no significant plot value. However, these are the most well-crafted scenes of all (and the ones that I still remember after all those years). In the end, the plot takes a backstage to the overall mood and characterisation of the protagonists",positive
"Oh geez, there's no denying that ""The Godfather"" is just plain awesome. I know, I know, this is NOT the first of gangster films, however, it was the start of mafia/mob movies to come, and certainly this is the ""godfather"" of them all. Francis Ford Coppola does something that no director has every done before, and really makes a film that is completely flawless. Though this movie is extremely violent, it's just so daring for any director to make a film so darn realistic. I don't know if he had anything to do with the mob, but seeing this, I swear he had to of. Though tons of movies that tried to be daring ended up being cliched and romanticized, this doesn't and really stands on its own. There's no plot, and just follows the lives of the Corleone family in a way that makes this terrible people interesting, and you honestly like them. And still, not one minute of this could happen without the standout actors, and of course, everyone who got any recognition from the Academy deserved it. As for the script writers, they deserve as much credit as they can get. ""The Godfather"" is one of the best films ever made. If you haven't seen it, I can say that I highly, highly recommend it.",positive
"I have decided I am going to write more reviews... for as many movies as possible... And ""The Godfather"" is the perfect film to start this tradition. Undoubtedly one of the most riveting epic films of all time, The Godfather set a precedent for crime drama films that none could match.Each character is well defined through fine scripting, excellent story-telling, and powerful performances. The curiosity to explore every facet of this 175 minute film worth every second. Every dialogue of the film is delivered to the audience with an essence that as integral as the content of the dialogue itself. Finally, I must accolade Nino Rota for giving a beautiful love theme to this world. This film has become an institution itself for anyone who wishes to understand the fine art of filmmaking.",positive

"This is hands down the best film I have ever seen. This is the closest thing to perfection i have ever seen in a movie. The way you see Al Pacino's character change from start to finish is amazing. James Caan played his part perfectly, seeing him play this hot head arrogant character added this great quality to the film. Robert Duvall was brilliant he was a perfect fit for this role, he was rational and reasonable. And their is no way I can forget about Marlon Brando, their are no words to describe how he played his part it was better than perfect. This movie lives up to its reputation as one of the if not the best movie of all time.",positive

"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten. This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.",positive

The best movie EVER made! No movie came close...,positive
"In cinema, there are few films that can, at all, be considered either great, and fewer that can be considered perfect. Mario Puzoâ(TM)s The Godfather is one of those films that is perfect. Being based of off the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola creates one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian crime family. When most people think about films that deal with the Mafia, Italian gangsters, what they think about is people that ship drugs, deal with prostitution, and above all else, just fight others for the hell of it. But, what makes The Godfather so different is that, contrary to the rather dark, violent nature of the film, this movie destroys all stereo types as it becomes a film that is not, at all, about running a crime family. This film is REALLY about a father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes. When Mario Puzo decided to originally write the novel that this film is based on, he did it only for the money and nothing else. But what he did not expect was to have his entire creation take a complete life of itâ(TM)s own in a way that only few people can imagine. Even more so was the shock of how well this film did. Want a little taste of how well this film did? Before the film was even released, The Godfather Part II was already in development. But, more on that later. Now, my complete reaction to watching this film. To say that this is one of my personal favorite films of all time would be something of a drastic understatement. With me, there are some films that you like and some that change your life. This is one of those films that changes your life with each and every viewing. When I first sat down and watched this film, I remember feeling complete once the credits started to role. I know that sounds cheap, but it is true. Everything from the story to they way â~Donâ(TM) Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in this film, it just spoke to me in a way that very few films can ever do. And I am not the only one that felt this way. There is a magic in this movie that can never be paralleled and the closes that we get (and one that is pretty damn close at that) is the sequel that is said to be equal to better then this film. But more on that later. Letâ(TM)s get down to the details. With direction, Coppola does wonders. He keeps the story moving, never dragging behind, and keeps making you interested with the look of the film. While some have complained about the lighting used as being too dark of a film or too gold, I say that the use of that is, quite fantastic. The reason why is because it always sets the mood for the scene and the tone that you will end up feeling. Plus, little added in items like the use of oranges in some scenes give this film a little kick by letting the audience know that something is about to go down. For the direction, Coppola, you do wonders. And the Academy Award for Best Direction was well won and deserved. Now the acting. Oh, my God. What can I say? Well, letâ(TM)s think. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Al Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Need I say more? Okay, I will talk about the supporting cast. With huge names like Richard Dreyfus, James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Diane Keaton, this film is filled with some of the greatest talent that money can buy. But what shocks me the most is that they treat this film with such a tone of seriousness that they literally stop becoming themselves and become these incredible people. Next the score. Like so many classic films, this filmâ(TM)s score is something of a staple in film history. Mostly due to the famous â~The Godfather Waltzâ(TM), Nina Rota became a household name in the music world due to the simplicity of that piece. It was simple, yet set the tone perfectly. The only crime that has ever been done on this film was the score not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Oh well. Later on, this film saga will get itâ(TM)s award. Finally the script. Being adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, and being written by him and Coppola, this film mirrors the novel so closely that you would only have to read the novel to know more about the extra characters that are not THAT huge. The dialogue is authentic, honest, and bold as this well written script is presented. The Academy Award for Best adapted Screen play was also well deserved. Overall, this entire film is worthy of the magnitude that it has gotten, the awards it has won (including Best Film), and the hearts and souls it has touched. Easily one of the greatest films ever made.",positive
"I have finally seen this movie after getting the trilogy on Blu-ray and having it sit on my shelf for a year and a half. While I love this movie, I don't feel like I need to see it again, but it is a masterpiece of cinema. My only complaints are that while Marlon Brando is incredible, he's not in it enough to be the lead actor, because it's really Al Pacino's show, but I guess it's a True Grit situation, Brando was more famous at the time it came out and Pacino was unknown at the time, also like Jeff Bridges in True Grit, there are moments where I couldn't understand what Marlon Brando was saying at all. This other criticism isn't directed at the movie, but toward the Blu-ray, the Coppola restoration does look good, but it doesn't look as amazing as I thought it would be, but this isn't a mark toward the quality of the film Again it's an amazing film, but I don't adore it like I do with movies like Jaws or Star Wars, but for three hours, it moves at a good pace and I hear that Part II is better.",positive
This is the best gangster movie ever made. The acting is superb and it has a gripping emotional story.,positive
The ultimate family film. Holy shit!,positive
"With a perfect cast, a remarkable storyline, and amazing directing, The Godfather is an American icon, and could not have been better in any way.",positive
"The Godfather is a film I always wanted to watch. I bought the DVD's, left them sitting proudly with all the others, waiting for the right time to watch them, to appreciate them. Like a fine wine, they better with age. Finally, I could wait no more. I had to see what the fuss and furore was about. I was not let down. I took both The Godfather I and Godfather II as one film, where the style and nature of both Don Vito Corleone, and Michael Corleone, could be compared and contrasted. The storyline was amazing. It saddens me that masterpieces like this, such fine pieces of art, are so rare in modern cinema and film. Like our music, we must look to the past for examples of excellence.",positive
The template for perfection,positive
"The Godfather is what filmmaking is all about: masterful story telling, precise attention to detail, a compelling story, and general virtuosity in acting and directing.",positive
"They say every male audience like this movie...which kinda put me off but I cannot help admire its brilliance. What I love is the raw nature of the movie...its production is very polished but there is this raw energy in every character...and the story is both entertaining and engaging in the sense that it makes you really think about the complex relationship between power, violence, and family bond. Perfect in almost every aspect. Just the amount of tension in the restaurant shooting scene makes this movie worth a watch.",positive
"In my eyes, this is the perfect movie!",positive
"Though definitely profane and brutally violent, The Godfather tells a story in such a rich way that it leaves most of the drivel of both yesterday and today well behind.",positive
"Absolutely stunning piece of film. What else is there to say? It's epic in scale, beautifully performed with gorgeous cinematography.",positive
"""The Godfather"" isn't just great because of its plot, its scripting, its acting, or its directing (all of which are top-notch), but it takes film a step further. There's a bounty of underlying themes to be unexpectedly found in the film. The story is interesting. The acting is good. The film is captivating. But there's more to it. There's a compelling element that's so difficult to achieve and so rare to see in modern film. Yes, it's a classic.",positive
"Finally they give me a classic film to rate! Well, what can be said about this film? It's one of the greatest of all time. Doesn't get much better.",positive
Single handedly the best movie ever....,positive
Don't even try to argue this one.,positive
"Now this is what film-making is all about! It personifies what movies should be as an art-form. A true masterpiece of film-making with a star-studded cast, headed up by the man who revolutionized the craft of acting, Marlon Brando.",positive
The perfect movie. Beautifuly acted by the entire cast. My #1 film ever.,positive
"One of the best movies ever made, 'the Godfather' brings some of the strongest performances by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in their careers, portraying the Italian mafias that have been alive since the end of World War II.",positive
"If this film doesn't blow you away, check your pulse.",positive
"BEST MOVIE EVA ITS MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME YOU MUST WATCH IT. . . . BUT, IF YOU ARE NOT PATIENT, LEAVE NOW, THIS MOVIE IS ONLY FOR TRUE MOVIE FANATICS. WATCH IT WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS ALREADY SEEN IT BECAUSE YOU NEED SOMEONE TO HELP EXPLAIN PARTS TO YOU THAT YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND. ALSO IF YOU ARE EXPECTING 30 PEOPLE TO DIE IN THE FIRST HOUR I WANT TO YOU NEVER WATCH THE GODFATHER BECAUSE THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU.",positive
One of the Top 10 movies of all time without a doubt. Marlon Brando is incredible and Al Pacino is great as well. When 4 mafia families go at it people like Luka start sleeping with the fishes.,positive
Brilliant ...... & sexy!,positive
"One of the greatest achievements in motion picture history. The Godfather is a smart, well-written, and terrifically acted piece of entertainment that still delivers decades after its release. Al Pacino came to prominence, Marlon Brando cemented his legacy, and The Godfather still lives on. One of my all-time favorite movies!",positive
"Flawless acting, absolute classic",positive
"Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. A must-have in every movie collection.",positive
A good gangster movie but it was slow at parts and had a couple of confusing parts,positive
"In 1972, Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' was released...With the exception of 'The Godfather Part II', there has not been a better motion picture since or before...A towering, unwavering masterwork,...",positive
"It is a long film, but good enough to attract me until I finished it. I don't like films in which a lot of people are killed, like some action films, but killings in conflicts between mafias are a drama in itself.",positive
"One of Hollywood's highest cinematic achievements, The Godfather instituted new standards for American motion pictures and allowed us an inside look at the Mafia in the process.",positive
"It goes without saying, The Godfather is the Citizen Kane of mafia stories.",positive
AMAZING film- another must see,positive
A undisputed masterpiece.,positive
"This is the best film for me ever. Deep, smart, brilliantly made, life-teaching... I can talk about the whole time. But even that is not enough.",positive
"Harry who? How about Don Vito Corleone! Simply the greatest film ever produced, simply timeless.",positive
"I've never before been bored by a slow-moving film. Ever so much more weight is put on the horse-head scene than it supports. A husband-wife fight is phoney, weak, amateur and isn't even peanuts compared to any such scene by Scorsese. A curly-haired guy beats a guy up and it looks as fake as the fakest action I've ever seen; it was so bad it was hysterical. As in the faintly superior sequel, Robert Duvall's role consists almost entirely of standing around looking mildly concerned. Early scenes with Brando are effective enough, but not a whole lot else is. That curly-haired guy gets shot by a whole buncha guys later on and some friends asked me if I understood how and why the ambush happened as though I could possibly care why it happened or who he was. I heard one person complain that the film 'insists on itself', but it seemed to me more like it didn't even care it existed. At the moment, this movie has nearly five hundred and fifty thousand votes on I.M.D.B., but 'Goodfellas' has only three hundred and twenty-five thousand and 'Casino' barely over a hundred and fifty thousand. Sad. But Francis Ford went on to make an infinitely better film only seven years later, and his daughter an unutterably better one three decades later, and so the Family thrives.",negative
"Superb acting, beautiful cinematography, and an engaging plot lead to one of the most artful and stunning movies ever produced.",positive
Not overated in the least bit,positive
"Some people today really don't see what all the fuss is about 'The Godfather', but for me, I adore this movie. It is one of the classics of cinema and to me, will always remain so. It is so deep with drama and passion, it's hard to view it untouched.",positive
"You know, The Godfather may seem overrated to many people, but it is without a doubt one of those movies that can never be replaced. Never could a remake or another movie altogether come close to the excellence, the time, the talent, and the all around success of this legendary movie. A flawless blend of every element that a perfect movie should have, it will always remain as one of those films that can never be forgotten.",positive
"A monumental piece of film making, this evergreen classic paved the way for many more gangster flicks which came later on..... But they sure can't beat this one!!!",positive
An incredible and engrossing work of art. The Godfather grabs you in the first 10 minutes of the film. Amazingly acted and incredible acting all around. There is a myriad of reasons why many call this one of the best films of all time.,positive
"Apparently I had seen this before but must have been bored out of my mind because I remembered very little about it except for certain scenes. Several years and older and wise, it was like watching for the first time. Loved it! The Godfather : Part II has moved to the top of my Netflix queue.",positive

"'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame. A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part - and there are a lot of them - has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting. Marlon Brando - in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback - gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.",positive
I wont say this movie is 1 of the greatest because it is the greatest movie.....,positive
"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie? I mean, really?",positive
"This movie was amazing. I'm pretty sure it was flawless and I bet no one would disagree with that. It has great acting, story, and basically everything. This is easily in my top 3 favorite movies of all time. Grade: A+",positive
"Took forever for me to finally see it,but it was definetly great!!!!",positive
Best movie ever! The Godfather says: fck Harry Potter.,positive

The ultimate family film.,positive

"I don't care how much it's said, one of the true essentials.",positive
"The perfect mob movie and one that will stand the test of time, for all time with stunning performances, a story like no other, and remarkable cinematography.",positive
I must be one of the last people to see this. I was not too impressed. Really too slow and long.,negative
"Personally, I Did Not Have A Good Experience With This Movie! It Was WAY TOO DAMN LONG!!! The Beginning Was Just Making Mee Want To Just Fall Asleep! The Only Scenes In The Movie That Kept Me Awake, (& That Were The Best Parts Of The Movie) Were Whenever Al Pacino Was On Screen Or Any Scene Someone Was Getting Shot! But, That's Just Me! Personally, I Like The 2nd Movie A Lot More Than This One!",negative
"The greatest of all films. It gets everything right from the casting down to the engrossing story and characters. The level of violence is unsettling to watch, but maybe that's a good thing considering what the plot is about. All together it is the best of the best. This is how good Citizen Kane SHOULD have been.",positive
"The Godfather doesn't age the the film never dies. When everything in a film is so close to perfection, it becomes impossible to grasp how anyone, no matter how simple minded or shallow, are capable of not enjoying it. Memorable, well acted, drawing, dramatic, and epic, The Godfather succeeds on every single level. From the excellent sets, fantastic costumes, and dotted with savory grit, violence, full on punches, The Godfather makes it's impact.",positive
One of best EVER!!!!,positive
One of the best movies ever made for so many reasons.....,positive
"What is there left to say about this titan of a film that hasn't been riffed, quoted, spoofed or re-enacted since it's release in 1972. It's a film that is infused in our culture, it's romantacized portrayal of American/Italian Mafia family feels so real to many who have grown up with similar heritage, it's metaphorical insight to capitalism in America is majestically 'Shakesperean' in it's delivery and although it's 'a bunch of gangsters doing a bunch of gangster shit' (to quote Tarantino) the audience is so emotionally connected that we actually care about these shady characters. The film is so richly and lovingly brought to the screen by Coppola who has infused his Italian heritage into every golden frame, and it feels somehow authentic. There is not enough superlatives to describe the performances, the eminently quotable dialogue and the hauntingly memorable scenes that stay with you forever once you experience them for the first time. A masterpiece that is so deserved of it's acclaim and arguably only bettered by it's sequel. A truly important artistic achievement from a visionary director.",positive
"A film that displays a strong sense of story and character and rather good cinematography, but falls victim to tasteless flaws. A montage of bumpy car shots fade into each other while a useless conversation within the car is crudely dubbed over top. Ugly things like this exist amidst the great things. Music is strongly overused also.",positive
Wow. Francis Ford Coppola is my idol. I pretty much consider this to be the rise of Michael Corleone. Marlon Brando in one of his most legendary performances ever. Great from start to finish in all aspects.,positive
un irremplacable que j'adore!!,positive
"Wasn't as gory as I was led to believe. Good story and well acted, convincing characters. Would have given it five stars but for Marlon Brando's speech impediment......Spent the whole film thinking ""I'm sure Al Pacino is Michael, but it doesn't look like him"", but then I think the only AP film I have seen is Scent of a Woman and he was just a bit older in that!",positive
The greatest Gangster film. 'Nuff said,positive
Absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen.,positive
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse 8-|,positive
"a lil bit dragging, i think. And I personally think the Sicilian wife part is slightly unneccessary, well maybe someone could enlighten me about the relevance. Having said that, I still think it's a great movie. Start fearing my fiance's gonna do bad things on my back.",positive
"Brando slouches and mumbles his way through this movie like a brilliant talented dangerous bear. There's a creeping unease as the movie unfolds that all will not be well in the Corleone family when the credits roll. Beautifully scored and shot in browns and dark tones like the olive groves in Sicilly. Absolute classic, one of these you just gotta see and leave a little piece of yourself listening at the keyhole of michael's study.",positive
Classic movie. Brilliant and inspirational.,positive
One of the best movies ever. I am one of a few who believe the second is better.,positive
GODFATHER of world cinema :),positive
"The reason that we screen films at the Bell Lightbox is so we can better appreciate todayâ(TM)s films. Itâ(TM)s not solely a matter of enjoying the film that is shown - although that is also a significant factor - but to understand its impact on the films that followed it. The Godfather is one of the best films of all time and it is always satisfying, despite the condescension dripping from Lightbox staff and the crowd of jackanapes who had smuggled six-packs into the theatre and insisted on quoting every famous line aloud. Those drawbacks were trivial relative to the scope and scale of Francis Ford Coppolaâ(TM)s epic. The violence and the nihilism of the film shine through brightly in the theatre, given a suitable stage after too many viewings on television and DVD. Despite the blood and gore, the film holds many humourous moments, an attribute that I did not fully appreciate until this past screening. I never felt that the book was very good, aside from holding an interesting premise, but the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo is sensational. The film is populated by many iconic characters and littered with countless memorable moments. Vito Corleone, the brutal Godfather who balances a life between his business and his family. His son Michael, who initially wants no part of la Cosa Nostra but is driven to become a very cruel and calculating Don after the death of his wife Apollonia. Moe Green, the arrogant casino magnate who is shot in the eye while on a massage table. So many directors, such as Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese benefited from the moral grey areas these characters created in a world that was previously black and white. I had always known that Coppola and George Lucas have been linked throughout their careers, beginning with American Graffiti and THX 1138 but I was unaware until recently that how heavily the climatic scenes of the Star Wars films were based on The Godfather. Seeing the film in great detail confirms statements made by Lucas. Furthermore, the attention to detail remains superb, from the sets and costumes (the stock footage is hardly noticeable) to the dialogue to the direction. Method actors make the characters come to life. It would be easy for someone to overact but almost all of the roles are played delicately. Coppola combines a mix of trailing shots while dissolving from one scene to another to show how the Corleone business is intricately connected with the Corleone family and uses appropriate blast cuts to show the violence that is require from time to time. The soundtrack captures the mood of the characters perfectly. Surely, one could watch the film at home and be mostly entertained but watching it in the theatre is a unique experience that definitely showcases the film as a work of art.",positive
"Brilliantly bold, the Godfather explores true depths of cinematic possibilities and creates new possibilities. Simply Stunning.",positive
"The Godfather is the indisputable masterpiece of American twentieth century cinema, bringing together Coppola's and Puzo's masterful storytelling, an Oscar-worthy cast, and an unforgettable journey into the sympathetically ruthless heart of the 1940s and 50s mobster underworld.",positive
I will make you an offer you cannot refuse.,positive
So boring. Could Brando be any worse. Coppola hasn't made a good movie besides Jack.,negative
I feel sorry for whoever has not seen this movie. It's a CLASSIC and is well-deserved of the praise!!!,positive
"It's hard to review such a film as The Godfather, It has one of the greatest cast and most memorable characters i have ever seen, a hard hand of direction from Coppola and a serie of events that give us a more complex inside and close us to Michael into a spiral of moral and anti-moral, believe it or not i felt it so recent even if has 40 years from be one of the finest movies for the critics and public.",positive
A movie that you can't refuse.,positive
"Perfect in every single way, this movie can't be beat no matter how hard people try, it simply can't.",positive
"One of the greatest films ever. The movie works in all its aspects and as a whole, you get to experience a masterpiece. I have always admired Directors and what they are able to accomplish in this medium and seeing Francis Ford Coppola's mastery in this film is ethereal. His pacing is so perfect, creating moments of tension and release so flawlessly, that you suspend all belief and become enthralled in the story. His compositional chiaroscuro is superb, blending dark and light expertly. This is a directing at its apex. The acting in this film is amazing. Even the bit actors deliver strong performances. To detail what each actor brought to the film could fill a book. Suffice it to say that Pacino was incredible, Brando was as near perfect as you could possibly be, Caan was awesome and Duval was excellent. Their delivery and interplay with the story was crucial in making this film such a success. Pure professionalism. The story and writing are what movie screenplays should aspire to be. Very vivid writing and dialogue, which makes you feel as though you are actually experiencing real life. Expertly written. My very poor review does not do justice to such excellence. This film should be seen by each and every person on the planet. If all the other films that have come out after this film would strive to achieve this excellence, our world would be a better place.",positive

The Godfather is one of the best movies in history. Marlon Brando played the best role of his life and the one who would definitely confirm his legend.

"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels.

Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was the best supporting actor to me, he did an excellent job. he was really good. James Caan as Sonny Corleone was good too and so was Robert Duvall as Tom Hegan. other actors include John Cazale, Diane Keaton , Sterling Hayden , Richard Conte , Talia Shire , Al Lettieri , Al Martino , Lenny Montana , Rudy Bond , Richard Bright , Richard S. Castellano , Franco Citti , Corrado Gaipa , Tony Giorgio , Julie Gregg , Angelo Infanti and others. superb supporting cast and a one big alone one that was so powerful that it is beyond words to describe his performance. this movie had good dialogues, nice background score and soundtracks. i liked the editing too, nice work by them. superb cinematography and art direction along with the costumes direction. yes there is violent scenes, action and shooting scenes are less and i like it. not nowadays where you see alot of action and less good writing. they do it to cover the bad written work up. but not here. but there were good amounts of them you see people getting shot and killed in violent ways. there were some really classic scenes which are so memorable to be honest. this movie is tragic too. and an epic story about a family. i don't even have to say this i think but this is a MUST WATCH.",positive

Pinnacle of movie making and by far the most influential movies as far as Hollywood is concerned. A brilliant adaptation from an equally excellent book. It makes you feel part of their family and you empathize and react to the numerous emotions it takes you through. One movie you can guarantee that it has both style and content with a terrific soundtrack which is now legendary along with the catchphrase.,positive
"Awesome directing, amazing acting and a stunning soundtrack.",positive
"The bible of mafia movies. Wonderful cast, characters, and story. It's not just a mafia movie. It's about family, honor, really just fascinating. Great quotes. The book is just as good.",positive
"I watched this film for the first time in about 6 or 7 years, I did not write a review because I was only ten when I first saw the first two films and I did not fully understand it, now at 16, I think I do so here's what I think. Perfection is something that the film makes look easy, it's like it was destined for it. The acting from all with the exception of the woman who played Michael's sister is as close as it gets to flawless. Even when Michael starts to gain his power, Al Pacino was not exactly an intimidating looking guy, and he isn't even know. But there was something about the way he presented himself in those scenes that just gave him that look like others feared him. I have never really been that big of a fan of Marlon Brando, but anyone with any knowledge of cinema and acting whatsoever cannot say that his performance is not one of the greatest in cinematic history, I think that it would be impossible to say otherwise. Duvall probably has the most likeable role in the movie as Tom, the guy who follows orders and hardly ever asks questions. Duvall is one of our times finest actors and he shows why like he has showed in many in this film. The score, Nino Rota's music is truly unlike any other score ever released, it might not be this complex.. whatever, there is something about it that makes it almost like a dream. The directing is perfect, the lighting is fantastic, all of the supporting roles are fantastic, it moves smoothly and swiftly, it does not even feel like a three hour movie, mainly it did not to me because I was too busy admiring it. James Caan is also very good. I give the film 4 stars because I like to rate movies like the pro's do it, maybe one day I'll make a great movies section like Ebert, The Godfather will of course go in, I'm glad I watched it again after all these years.",positive
"I don't get it... I do have to admit the end of the movie is an absolutely amazing piece of cinema, regardless of how much I enjoy watching this, in my opinion, slow and dreary movie.",negative
"Its hard to find any real flaws in this movie, mainly because its an absolute masterpiece with one of the greatest casts and plot from any movie.",positive
only because i canÂ´t give it 10 stars...,positive
"9.0/10 The most overrated word is most definitely ""overrated"". Recently, I've heard the word been used in the most peculiar of situations; one of them being to describe the world-renowned cinematic classic, ""The Godfather"". Cinephiles of all ages are always attacking ""classics"" because they go in with some pretty large expectations. And when they don't get the ""best movie of all time"", they start making up reasons why the movie might be ""bad"". See...I don't like that, and I'll never do it. I review films based on my personal enjoyment and/or admiration for the movie, as well as the effort that was put into every key aspect. If a movie has a brilliant script, then it will entertain me no matter what. A good movie is a good movie. And ""The Godfather"" is most definitely one. There were good and even great gangster films before this one. Francis Ford Coppola, the director and co-writer behind this fine production, simply put the icing on the cake by making an undeniably historical one. Love it or hate it, ""The Godfather"" definitely did something for cinema. Heck, when people think ""crime/gangster/mob cinema"", they instantly think of this very film. That is because ""The Godfather"" is memorable for many, forgettable for others, and boring-as-hell for those without attention spans or the intelligence required to enjoy it. I enjoy a good mobster flick. I like stories involving the types of people involved. ""The Godfather"" probably inspired half of the mob flicks that I like, and one show which I love. ""The Godfather"" is not only superb entertainment, but also superb screen-writing. This is purely based on opinion, but one cannot deny facts. And here's a fact for you: ""The Godfather"" is a well-made cinematic landmark. The film opens on the wedding reception of Don Vito Corleone's (Marlon Brando) daughter. There is much discussion about business, favors, and Hollywood during the reception, and then life goes on. However, there is something I must tell you: the Don heads the greatest Mafia family in New York City area. The Don's son, Michael (Al Pacino) has ambition to become the head of the crime family after his father passes, as does the possibly even more ambitious Sonny (James Cann). The film follows the downfall and possibly re-birth of the Corleone family, as the Don grows weak after being shot. As can be expected, his son and Sonny attempt to get revenge on the shooters. The now bed-ridden Don is getting old, and the new ""godfather"", or if you prefer to use the term I have been using, ""don"", must be chosen. In twists of drug involvements, Vegas trips, and casinos; ""The Godfather"" tells its story with efficiency and masterful observation. I understand that my analysis of the story may not be perfect. That's not entirely as I see it, although that's as much info as I'm willing to give. The story is not special because it unfolds within a three hour film; it is special because it is the story of ""The Godfather"". Adapted very well from the novel of the same name, the film attempts to show an emotional and soft side to the gangsters, as no film had done such a thing at the time. The film was legendary and critically acclaimed for many reasons, and the approach it took to mobsters and criminals within ""families"" was one of them. Brando owns this movie. I have a feeling that without him, it just wouldn't have been ""The Godfather"". Marlon Brando is the kind of actor who can make a film good just by showing his presence. He's such a talented man, and this is one of his most memorable roles, among others. The supporting cast is as entertaining as it needs to be, much like the film. So everything works out fine. Coppola establishes a pretty nice look for his movie. The cinematography is flawless and often times, the shots are memorable. We see some pretty wild and creative sights that even give us insight. Coppola has the directorial skills necessary to take something harrowing/bold, and make it into something perhaps more...interesting. ""The Godfather"" is a perfect example of American movie-making, a perfect example of what Francis Ford Coppola is capable of, and a perfect example of how to balance good dialogue, a good screen-play, a good director, and a good cast to make a film that shall impress anyone willing to accept it for what it is. I wouldn't suggest watching the film with expectations, for who knows: if you do that, you may end up like those poor, unlucky saps that just couldn't enjoy the film. They think it's a snooze-fest; I think it's an intellectually stimulating and intoxicating vision. It's a long crime epic, but for every moment of those three hours, I was hooked. And it takes a very good movie to do that. ""The Godfather"" is perhaps more than a very good movie. And it deserves every bit of that praise.",positive
Fucking awesome.No more words to describe.,positive
"""Michael: That's my family Kay, that's not me""",positive
It insists upon itself.,negative
Best movie ever made.,positive
"I know, I know. It's predictable as far as what i'm going to say. but you know what, screw it. Just because I'm going to praise this film like everyone else, doesn't make it less true that this is the greatest film ever. plus i've almost written 100 reviews, so i'm making sure I don't reach 100 without writing my review fo this masterpiece. Plot: The movie starts in 1945 where the mob in New York consists of The Five Families. They are the Corleones, the Cuneo's, the Tattaglias, the Stracci's and the Barzini's. The main characters in this film are the Corleones, lead by their leader, Don Vito Corleone, or ""The Godfather"". The movie begins with the Godfather's daughter's wedding where his youngest son, Michael, returns from World War II with his girlfriend Kay Adams. And you know what, for those who haven't seen the movie, that's all i'm going to say from here. Now the truth is, I didn't love this film right away. Mostly because I didn't really get it. I mean i got the general gist, but that was it. But i got to understand it better when I watched it more than once and played the Wii game which helped me understand things better like knowing a lot of the characters and being familiar with the Five Families and all that. After that, i began to understand and appreciate it more and began to love it after seeing it so many times now. Actors/Characters: James Caan/Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone: He did a pretty good job. It was messed up to see him the first time considering that I saw Caan in Elf before I saw this film. But yeah. He was pretty good. Richard S. Castellano/ Peter ""Fat"" Clemenza: I enjoyed him. He was a fun character. Robert Dunvall/Tom Hagan: Tom is my favorite character. He's was a much more lovable character than the rest. The was smart, had a nice background story. and let's not forgot his time earlier in the film with that producer. I just really like him. Al Pacino/Michael Corleone: And so it begins. For those of you who haven't seen it yet, don't worry about what I mean. But this Is quite the character. He goes through so much in this film and Al Pacino does an excellent job acting it all out. And Of coarse... Marlon Brando/Don Vito Corleone aka The Godfather: Now part of why I didn't care for the film too much at first was how Brando wasn't in the movie all that much. I mean i've heard about the character from spoofs of the film like Men in Tights and all that. But thankfully i've gotten over it and just stuck with knowing that this is an excellent character. and I have been thinking about watching and writing reviews for all fo his movies. so yeah. Music: It was excellent. Very classic songs. Editing: Very well done. I mean it does show you one of the worst fist fighting scenes ever, but WHO CARES!?!?! That doesn't really make the movie any less good. Most people probably haven't even noticed that anyway. And that si my review for The Godfather. It's the best film ever made and i'm glad I finally wrote my review on it before i've written more than 100 reviews.",positive
Didn't really enjoy it that much.,negative
Greatest film I've seen yet.,positive
"Even though its not entirely in my personal interest, I can still spot a classic. Get's better as it goes along.",negative
"I think it's that I just barely saw this recently and have seen billions of pardodies before, but I just didn't care for it. I felt after the years of hype and praise I'd like it, but I was bored and felt like it was nothing spectacular.",negative
It never hit me the way everyone else seems to respond. I probably just need to watch it again...,negative
Simply the greatest movie ever made!,positive
100% thats all i know how to say for this film.,positive
"After watching this, I admit, I am 'blown away' by the classical, philosophical, and organic approach to both of the terms Gangster and Crime and the lifestyle. Francis Ford Coppola's direction of the film is by far the most magnificent I've seen in cinema history. Marlon Brando & Al Pacino have my full praise for their performance. I was really amazed by the intensity of the suspenseful mood and fierce yet calm dialogue. Most definitely a newly found favorite of mine.",positive
Come on. It's the best anything ever.,positive
"Simply WOAHH!! No surprise this is still 100 % fresh here on RT. This is a genuine Godly creation. Francis Ford Cappola..i don't have words to describe the guy. Calling him a genius would be an understatement. Writing, Acting, Directing, everything textbook stuff. Besides this has to be considered that when this was made Hollywood was still in its growth era but is still flawless in every possible aspect on which a film is Judged. The Only film that didn't make me yawn even though it has this 177 min timeline. 5 stars are nothing for this. Long live the memory of the greatest creation ever to grace Hollywood.",positive
"With a chilling, deep, dramatic story, ungodly acting, brief yet memorable moments of dark and light humor, an attention captivating soundtrack, and so many other qualities that make this arguably the greatest motion picture in all of cinema's history. Definitely one of the greatest moments in my movie viewing life. This film is exciting, edge-of-your-seat, heart pounding pure perfection. If there was a manual on how to create a movie, the first and only step would be watch The Godfather. Need I say more?",positive
"A highlight in American cinema, Godfather is a rich, layered, and powerful classic. The film's greatest achievement though, is it's ability to create tremendous mood through lighting and art direction. I can appreciate why it is one of the most widely imitated films but frankly, I found it to be quite slow at times and ultimately, overrated. Yes, Brando is fantastic, but for all the great catchphrases there are three more scenes that drag on far too long. I know I'm one of the few who feel this way but still, 4/5 is pretty damn good.",positive
The movie close to perfection,positive
It insists upon itself.,negative
"No real explanation needed here. If you don't like The Godfather, you don't like movies.",positive
"With some of the best cast choices, an amazing director, and an amazing script, was there any doubt this film would be amazing? It's completely mind blowing on what Francis Ford Coppola did, as well as the every single person who worked on it. No wonder it's said to be one of the best films of all time! It's completely outstanding. I wouldn't even be afraid to call this movie perfect. It really pushes the limits of a mob film, and every film following a concept even slightly similar to this has taken points from this film. Firstly, let's talk about the plot, because there's not much to say without giving away anything, but I'll do my best. It's about the Corleone family, a ""Mafia"" family and their struggle with the leader of the family, Don, grows aged, and Michael, his son, is to take his place when he passes away. I would say more, but it's very complex and long, and I'd spoil some of the surprises, so just trust me on this, the plot is very well done. Now, something very important, the violence. The violence is gruesome, disturbing, and very intense, absolutely NOT recommended for kids, even with adults around. Now, something I must warn, as it really confused me for the first while: The first half of the film is why many consider the film boring, and I have a reason for that. It seems that Francis Ford Coppola wanted to really develop the characters and make them as important in the film is possible, so he seems to take the entire first half of the film to develop the characters, which is about an hour and thirty minutes. So, I shall warn you, if you hate slow movies, and don't care much about these types of characters, don't watch this movie, you'll be bored to death. As for everyone else, you can definitely enjoy the first half, especially because it makes the second half more intense and significant. So, don't be surprised if the movie seems very slow, it's worth it. Now, because this might be known as my most viewed post ever, as the film is well known, I shall do The Best and Worst of ""The Godfather"". The best was difficult for me to decide. I had to choose between the acting and the editing, so I've decided to pick the one I think is more important to a film, and acting edges out. The acting was outstanding. Al Pacino was the best by far, with his unlimited emotions and amazing delivery, he was tremendous in this performance. Also, James Caan and John Cazale were amazing, Marlon Brando made the character feel real, as if he wasn't Marlon Brando, he was the character, and Robert Duvall... awesome. Even the minor characters were portrayed wonderfully by their actors. Now the worst part of the film, which was extremely hard for me, but I decided to go with the ending, not because it was bad, far from it, I actually really liked the ending, but unlike everything else in the movie, it has a flaw. It feels empty, like it made you care so much for the characters, you were so interested in them, and right at the last few seconds, it literally shuts the door on them, basically saying ""That's all you get, I don't care if you want more, you'll just have to wait 2 years for the sequel"". I mean, it's a good ending, but it's the only thing in this movie I can complain about. So, overall, what would I say about this movie? Well, it's one of the best, check it out, you will not regret it. 5/5",positive
"""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
One of the best movies I have seen,positive
I finally got around to watching the Godfather and what a fantastic film it is.,positive
"The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that. The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination. But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability. As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years. The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two. However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing. To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against. I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible. There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable. The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous. The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.",positive

"5 stars is really not enough to express just how amazing this film is. The benchmark for any film. No it's not a family film, but it says more about family than anything else.

Without Mario Puzo mediocre novel, I don't know where cinema would be. This film set THE primary example of acting, cinematography, narratives, timing and mood. With such a raw vibe, and such brilliantly executed events, it is undoubtable one of the most powerful films anyone will ever make.

If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather.""",positive
THE MOST SPECTACULAR MOVIE POSSIBLE........ ABSOLUTE PERFECT OF A MOVIE WITHOUT A DOUBT GREATEST EVER,positive
What can I say its an American Classic.,positive
"Godfather is a truly remarkable, rememberable, and outstanding piece of cinema.",positive
"Good: Great acting by everyone, surprises and deaths, good action, many subplots that go into each character Bad: Nothing The story of the Corleone family crime syndacite, based in New York City.  Based on The Godfather by Mario Puzo. The family is overseen by the boss Vito Corleone, and his three sons Michael, Sonny, and Fredo. One of the best crime movies of all time, if not the best. In the beginning the movie has almost no forms of violence, much unlike Scarface, but later will have scenes of bloody action. Marlon Brando does an amazing performance as Vito Corleone, as does Al Pacino as Michael, and James Cean as Sonny. There is marvelous acting by even the extras and everyone in between.The plot holds many surprises, deaths, and treachery. The storyline goes deep into the characters, making many subplots in the movie. As an example The difficulties between Connie and Carlo in their relationship, which creates a conflict between other characters. This is a movie that you must really pay attention to, the story is so intricate that if you miss even small details at certain times you will left confused for the next few scenes until you can piece it together. The film stays true to the mafia with it's mafioso attitudes and rules. It also does with extremely Italian music, which is catchy and upbeat. The best musically inclined moment is during the opening wedding when the relatives are called upon the stage to sing a classic tune. The costumes that are worn by the actors are very fitting. They are dressed for a black tie affair, and when they're not, they dress themselves in a trench coat and bowler hat. The setting is exceptional. Whether it be the countryside of Sicily, or even the home that the Corleone's stay in. Vito Corleone is the most memorable person out of the cast, his voice is unique, as is the creativity in putting cotton balls into his mouth to puff up his cheeks a little. One of Marlon Brando's most spectacular performances. The scene with him in the garden is one of his most capturing. Vito can be known as the man that everyone goes to for a ""job"", or even just some advice. The script is one of the greatest I've seen, thanks to Mario Puzo. Filled with some great quotes in the movie (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse""). Even if the film is three hours long it doesn't move slowly for an instant, those small subplots keep you entertained for the entire film. They execute the solving of each one with expert timing. The ending left me wanting more. I am in anticipation of seeing the sequel.",positive
Not a single scene could be improved. A masterpiece!,positive
The greatest crime film ever and one of the best films ever to come out of any studio or country.,positive
A TRUE MASTERPIECE al pacino and marlon brando were brilliant great movie one of my favorite movies. Grade:A+++,positive
"Although I feel that all the Godfather movies are a little too long, it is difficult to criticise any of them. The story and performances are top notch.",positive
"A landmark for cinema. Brando's performance is possibly the best and most convincing I have ever seen. Pacino is also incredible, and of course he has since gone on to become one of the most revered actors of recent decades. We also see Alex Rocco, who later provided the voice of Roger Myers Jr. in 'The Simpsons'.",positive
If you don't like this movie I hope I never meet you.,positive
Brilliant adaptation of the book.,positive
"It's a bit long but this is a movie of quality. I think it marked the history of cinema. Good acting , interesting and captivating story and enjoyable to watch with many very hard moments. It's a great movie!",negative
master-fucking-piece,positive
One of Hollywood's greatest movies.,positive
"Yes, FINALLY saw it. Clearly, a superb film. Excellent performances the film flows exceedingly well. I was definitely held in rapt attention the whole time... I still thought Michael's meteoric rise to power as the Godfather was a bit unbelievable, but I can live with it.",positive
Incredible film but I just can't take Marlon Brando seriously.,positive
"No doubt. Contains golden lines, along with legendary soundtracks.",positive
It really is just damned good.,positive
... und dazu Rotwein und Lasagne ;),negative
Watch it if you haven't.,positive
"I read the novel by mario Puzi which built my interest to watch this ancient movie which I kept hearing about through my elder generation. I heard from everybody that this is the greatest movie ever, and my expectations for this movie grew and grew with every comment I heard & read. I saw the movie, and even with expectations as high as mine were,it was STILL more than what I expected.If u haven't seen this movie yet, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse: go watch it.",positive
Absolute and utter perfection! This film is one of my favorites and it is likely to stay that way. Brilliant performances from pacino and Brando just elevate this film to a new standard for all Hollywood productions.,positive
classic movie.....terbaek dr ladang..must watch movie..,positive
"I always thought that Citizen Kane was the single greatest movie movie ever made but this is still a perfect movie in every way. Even though Vito and Sonny and the rest of the mob are crooks, and get what they deserve, you can't help but to sympathize with them whenever something bad happens to them. It may be a little long but it passes by so fast and it is worth it. I haven't seen The Godfather Part II, but I'm really looking forward towards it.",positive
"It seems impossible to dislike this movies in any way, shape or form. If you haven't seen it, see it.",positive
"Probably the greatest movies in hollywood. Coppola just nails this one with the aspect of the italian mafia, but still keeps it on the down low. Great job.",positive
Watch at least once a year now for past 15 and I have to say it gets better each viewing. Brando is Great!,positive
The biggest achievement here is the establishment of mood and time.,positive
"absolutely brilliant! Pacino is great and all the supporting cast, great story and i love the climax. This film set the standard for every single gangster movie that has followed it, perhaps every single film of any genre, though i do not have a single favourite film, Others of mine include Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Once upon a time in America and Scarface and Citizen kane, these films i love just as much as the Godfather. The official three greatest movies of all time are The Godfather, Casablanca and Citizen Kane, i don't think the Godfather will ever be beaten.",positive
the godfather was a alright movie just the way they made everything look like it was during that actual time period makes it a good movie.,positive
"I absolutely love this film. This is really great movie, and I'm not speaking just for myself but for everyone because it is declared as the best film ever. The idea of film is rare, I can't imagine that someone could get such complicate but interesting idea. I love The Godfather part 2 and 3, too. I think it is equal to the part 1.",positive
The closest thing to a perfect movie I have ever seen,positive
"This movie is a great movie overall, it's a little long but it needs to be to fit everything in. Overall this movie is very strong, it has good acting, good story line, and good casting. It's 39 years old but has aged very well. This for sure a movie everyone should watch.",positive
"This is a great movie, especially for the time it was made. The acting, score, and plot were all cleverly thought out and put together so smoothly to create one hell of a movie. I would definitely recommend this to all movie lovers.",positive
"The best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be.",positive
"Sorry, everybody ever, but this is not the best film ever. It is very good, and Marlon Brando gives one of the greatest performances of all time, but many of the scenes are stretched out far too long.",positive
"Marlon Brando's cheeks annoyed me and I really don't think it's as memorable as everyone says, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie.",positive
"Deep, dramatic, funny, fun and unforgetable. The godfather is the closest thing to perfect cinema, as well as having a perfect plot and always being entertaining",positive
A movie that you cannot refuse to see... Classic in every sense of the word...,positive
"This movie was perfect. It had the perfect blend of action and drama. It even followed the book to a ""T"". It's amazing that the series goes way down after this one.",positive
"Coppola yet again gives us another masterpiece, beautiful cinematography and adapted screenplay which highly deserves best picture. The acting was spot on and the dialog was incredible this I think is the greatest film ever made!",positive
All time classic movie!,positive
What can be said about the Godfather?,positive
"O cinema tem dois tipos de filmes:Os ruins, e os bons.The Godfather está em nenhum dos dois lado. Ele está no maior nível de todos...O Melhor Filme da América de todos os tempos.",positive
"RT 100% One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema.",positive
"A masterpiece, which has a wonderful cast and a terrific directing by Coppola.",positive
"One of the supreme masterpieces of American cinema. Considering the amount of time one invests in seeing it, the three hours are well spent.",positive
"Still pretty good on a second viewing, you have to be into Mob movies to really enjoy this though, it's epic and there are so many other movies showing us the same stuff albeit this is the...um, Godfather of all Mafia movies I suppose. Sorry.",negative
"Possibly one of if not the greatest movies ever made. It is good to watch on any and every day since its release. Quotes and dialogue that are timeless. And a message that stands the test of time. ""Don't every take sides with anyone against the family"". Classic through and through.",positive
The film that set the precedent for all gangster/mob movies.,positive
Inarguably a classic. Better than Part 2!,positive
"I finally saw this movie for the first time the other night! Out of all the films I have seen, this is probably the best. Grade: A+",positive
"mela kisu liktam , kintu kisu manush ke promiss korsi , akhon theke amar review soto hobe ... amar review : Good movie ! :P",positive
Definitely no need for review. Anyone who has seen this film will know exactly why this is the greatest movie of all time!,positive
great movie to watch,positive
The bible of all films. There is NOTHING wrong with this film,positive
Greatness...don't know why I never watched it...I like Michael Corleone's style! Need to check the mail...think part II is waiting for me.,positive
Waited until I was eighteen to see this. I wasn't disappointed. Quickly became my favourite film next to The Goonies. Although the second one is a wee bit better!! :),positive
the cast is perfect!,positive
Bloody hell this film is AWESOME!,positive
"Ok. So the second film in my mission to clear through the AFI 100 Films Of All Time, and a disappointment. A shame really but not a real surprise. I give it this score because I didn't enjoy it, NOT because it's rubbish. The Godfather is anything but naff, in fact the acting and narrative is so damn good, it deserves to be where it is on the list. I however, really don't like mob films, as another classic Scarface proved when I tried anything just pass time during the film just to see the 'little friends' ending. I found myself doing much the same during this, and as I said previously, a shame. Don't let my distaste for gangster flicks to put you off seeing it though, if you like them you'll love it!",negative
The perfect mafia movie ...,positive
A poetic account of a family built on bloodshed and greed and living on an eggshell that's about to crack.,positive
"horrible, so confusing, to much dialoigue",negative
"No hay palabras para describir lo buena que es esta peli. Marlon Brando se luce, actorazo!!!!",positive
"the film is to complicated!!! however, when i saw that womas tits i again got really horny. the ending in which vito cornleone dies was funny though, LOL",negative
One of the greatest films of all time. Hands down,positive
"one of the best mob movies ever made, watched it and fell in love with it",positive
The Godfather is an amazing movie. The plot has so much meaning with family meaning more than anything. I can't wait to watch the second one.,positive
1972 - American Cinema chaged forever.,positive
My favorite movie of all time,positive
i understand why it's influential but it is still just some boring mafia stuff. Amazing soundtrack though,negative
"Been re-watching these with Rachel, who hadn't seen them before. Still brilliant.",positive
"Movie making at its finest, every scene in this film knits the whole story wonderfully together and it is superbly told, the acting is outstanding and made stars of the leading cast, the music score and direction sublime and beautiful, not just the greatest gangster film ever made the greatest film ever to come out of Hollywood, a majestic timeless masterpiece which you can watch over and over again",positive
"There is really no need to comment about anything in this film, it was just as perfect as you can get.",positive
"""My Boys... Look what they did to my boys..."" A cinematic masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made. The same goes for Part two. I actually consider both films shoud be regarded as a single one. I suggest reading the book, there is alot that is left out of the movie, paricularly a huge amount of chapters dedicated to Johnny Fontaine's exploits on Hollywood and alot of insight into Luca Brasi. Part 3 is awfull, btw.",positive
"I've been avoiding this film for as long as I can remember in fear of disliking the classic. It's safe to say, I was pleastantly surprised. It dragged a bit in the middle, but I was on the end of my seat once Al Pacino turns to the dark side.",positive
Good movie. Written well,positive
The grand-daddy of all movies,positive
"If ""The Godfather"" isn't considered the greatest film of all time, it's certainly somewhere in the top three. Its genius is pretty much indisputable as is its influence on film over the past four and a half decades. So rather than gush about the cinematography, iconic score, or earth-shaking performances like every other cinephile with a keyboard, I want to discuss something specific, something I believe scuffs what is otherwise a pristine work. Granted this is a lot like a scratch on a Lamborghini. It's annoying, but it's done nothing to hamper what is otherwise a marvel of automotive engineering. But like that scratch it stares at you, mocking you by its very presence. Once you see it, you can't unsee it, no matter how elevated the ride. For ""The Godfather,"" that scratch is its pacing. Though it creeps close to three hours long, it still feels like someone took a hacksaw to it in the editing room. Enormous time jumps happen without preface (a lot) and the resulting gaps are felt. It's like ascending a staircase with the occasional rotted-out board - an extravagant Victorian staircase trimmed with gold leaf, but it's still in need of restoration. The tail end of the second act marching straight into the conclusion are the biggest offenders in this regard. Michael Corleone's relationship with his wife Kay (though unimportant in the overarching narrative) is told in a few disparate beats and ends up feeling like it should have been left on the cutting room floor with the other untold orphan scenes. That said, Coppola's crowning work doesn't want for narrative drive. ""The Godfather"" has always been more about grand, thematic arcs than intimate character moments. It does stumble in pacing the particulars, but what it offers in return more than makes up for this small inadequacy. We come to this film again and again for the iconic experience, the witnessing of one of the greatest pieces of visual literature. I'm not about to argue against that. 9.1/10",positive
"Superb storytelling. The kind of movie that keeps you engrossed from start to finish. More than 3 decades after it was made, the Godfather does not look old and outdated at all, truly a timeless masterpiece.",positive
"First film in the Godfather trilogy. Don Vito Corleone's mafia empire is handed over to his son, Michael",positive
"My all time favorite movie, and the most compelling piece in its trilogy, the Godfather is a beautifully crafted film that underscores the complexities that come with change, and the subtleties involved with living.",positive
"The Godfather is a film that is the best of all time and as well of that time! Movies like this should be even more appreciated, because this masterpiece is truly an achievement!",positive
the best of the best,positive
Amazing. It truly lived up to the hype. A must see,positive
late to rate but that ghanges nothing !,positive
Just watched it again. It is quite simply movie perfection. No need to elaborate.,positive
"There have been lots of gangster films over the years, with over half of them staring De Niro or Pacino. And while many of those films have been exceptional, Goodfellas come to mind, the Godfather is the definitive movie and without it, mob films by Scorsese, De Palma and Leone would never have eventuated. While many mob films have been told from the side of an outsider such as policeman or civilians, this was the first, or one of them, to gain insight into the world of the orginized crime from one of their own. It is through this we are drawn into a world of brutal violence, rituals and most of all, family, which plays a huge role in the film. Why this had stood the test of time and ranks as one of the best films of all time has to be the impeccable storyline penned by diector Francis Ford Coppola and writer of the novel Mario Puzo who weave stories that are believable and intricate. This is of course the heart of any film and if the story isnt good, the films is terrible. The casting is impeccable and the ensemble is one of the best in Hollywood. Brando is totally unrecognizable as Don Vito Corleone in the role that one him the Oscar, although he famously refused it. And looking at his other films such as On the Waterfron or Apocalypse Now and you can see what a total transformation he has undergone, the very essence of acting. While he doesnt snap and act like the typical mobster with a trigger finger and a temper to match, he fills the room with fear and respect simply by being calm. It is all about presence. Pacino as Michael is also excellent as a civillian who is drawn into the world of crime and is left to rule the family empire. With an assortion of quotes that have become part of the everyday language, the Godfather is one of the first modern masterpieces. Although it has some slow secttions, finding a fault in the movie is like finding a needle in a haystack, it may exist but it takes a really good eye to find one. The only thing which I cant explain is the lack of Oscars that it won, only 3, for acting, screenplay and best picture. A classis such as this shouldve won far more than it did. Despte this, the Godfather definately holds its place as one of cinemas greatest films.",positive
The perfect piece of cinema centered around the life of organized crime,positive
This is THE gangster movie. Not A gangster movie. THE gangster movie.,positive
The greatest mob movie of all time.,positive
"A film that has stood the test of time and whilst I wouldnt rate it as highly as many, its difficult not to pay tribute to its strengths (of which there are many). Don is a Sicillian immigrant and the head of a family during the 1940s whos business is making money from any illegal activity ranging from Protection rackets to bribery. The exceptions to this rule are his daughter Connie and his youngest son Michael who has also been decorated for his bravery whilst in the Navy. Michael is aware of the nature of the families business but outwardly admits that he wants no part of it. But times are changing and Drugs are very lucrative and are fast becoming part of the criminal underworld. The problem is that Don wants no part of this and also feels that the important people on the payroll (eg, judges & politicians) may not want to deal with people who have such interests. This leads to a feeling from within the family (and beyond) that the Don is holding back the interests of the family and divisions arise. The cast is one that is immediately recognisable today but this is possibly due in large part to this film. All are very good though ive never been that bowled over by Brandon as Don. Sluggish and incoherent hes like the drunken bloke you get stuck talking to in the pub at the end of the night who you cant get rid of (weve all been there im sure). But where this film really does score is in the story itself and its presentation. For some reason it totally draws you in within minutes and you stay there and because of this the 3 hours in length doesnt seem it. The often overlooked score also adds a great deal to the very real tension that exists. But the over riding message I kept getting in the film was that if you lack loyalty then you perish but you also get a rough deal if you are loyal. So what should we do, be loyal or not as either way theres a strong chance that you are not going to last?",positive
"The Godfather is a really famous movie. It tells the story of a mafia-family. After the ""Godfather"" got sick, he gave his family organisation to his young son. The story is very exciting and interesting. It was the first movie i've seen like this. It shows a lot about the Italian life and how the mafia started dealing with drugs.",positive
"I really really like this movie. I think the whole idea of the movie was really smart, because it deals with crime but also and underlying issue which is family. They picked the perfect actors for these characters. It's a really serious, emotion filled movie.",positive
I liked this movie alot. It gave people a good idea of how the gangsters where back in the 70s. It was a good interesting but unexpecting movie. The way that one character completely changed sides was not what i expected at all but he is one of my favorite characters. The way curruption filled peoples lives back than was great.,positive
this film is a good idea on how mafia families are worked. but the movie was to drawn on. the godfather is a good movie for people that are in to action.,positive
this film is one of the most famous in history. This is for a vary good reason. It may lag a bit in certain places but that is only because it perfectly simulates real life. it is a thoroughly interesting film and one of the few dramas i enjoyed watching.,positive
This movie was awesome. I love the acting. Everyone did a great job with this movies. Now I know why is so famous. Everyone should see it.,positive
I thought the Godfather was a pretty good movie. It wasn't one of my favorite because I am not that interested in mafia movies. It had some really strong views in it that were interesting to watch. It also was interesting to see how a mafia family would work together to get what they wanted.,positive
"Does it GET any better than this? Oh, wait, Part 2 IS better.",positive
"I know the characters (Vito, Sonny, Clemenza, Tessio, etc.) are more intriguing in the original, but part 2 is ranked higher because it builds such a great story before and after this one.",positive
The most well thought out exceptionally made movie of all time.,positive
This is not juat a movie; it is a cultural icon. This is a movie that has influenced so many other movies that it must be seen. One of the finest movies ever made.,positive
The godfather is a perfect film.. It has all the thought ever needed to leave your mind wanting to know whats going to happen next. Loved the film and cant wait to see another like it. If someone can manage to do that..,positive
I ecpecially liked this movie because it had a lot of action to it. I am more of an action type of viewer and i think that the godfather had the perfect amount.,negative
"It is one of cinema's greatest achievements. Brando owned in this movie, and Al Pacino was robbed of an Oscar!",positive
One of the best of all time. Maybe even the best.,positive
"The greatest crime film deals with the passing of the family's crime empire from father to son. Trivia: Any character in this film with a blood orange in front of them will be killed. Vito did not die because that was a regular orange not a blood orange. ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse""",positive
Best Mobster movie ever!!!!,positive
"One of the greatest movies ever filmed. Period. Hell, it might be underrated.",positive
This movie was made the year I was born... By far the best movie in that genre I have ever watched.,positive
Boring. Drags on forever.,negative
Boring. Drags on forever.,negative
In my view this is the greatest movie of all time & one Ive watched maybe 10 or 12 times. Its almost the perfect film. If you haven't seen it your missing out. I could rave on forever about the epic scale of the movie & Coppolas direction but I wont :) Watch it.,positive
"This was, quite possibly, the greatest movie of all time, rivaled only by The Godfather Part 2. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are amazing, the script (based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo) produced some of the most famous quotes of all time. It also provides an intriguing, bloody, entertaining look into the seedy world of crime families without ever nearing the edge of physical possibility.",positive
"behold, the greatest film ever made.",positive
It is an offer I will never refuse.,positive
"One of the greatest acted and greatest filmed movies ever made. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan lead the cast in this brutal, compelling, intriguing, and at the same time, beautiful film, that ultimately underneath its violence and brutality has a redeeming message everyone can appreciate.",positive
Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.,positive
A stylistic masterpiece. Coppola at his best.,positive
An iconic and influential film which depicts an Italian-American family in the 1940's. Arguably the greatest film of all time.,positive
"Regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time ""The Godfather"" is a beloved classic about organized crime and the Sicilian lifestyle's in America. Of course the movie is about the building of a Dynasty, A buisness built on death, murder, betrayal then goes on to run itself on favours and illegal pleasures... However in this Story we see the life of ""Don"" Vito Corleone (played to a tee by the magnificent Marlon Brando) giving favours on his Daughter's Wedding day, Here we see a caring, loving man who is both loved and feared. So far in the movie it has had fair tension and introduced us to the family, then all of a sudden a film-maker awakes to find his prized race horse's head under he's sheets and suddenly the seriousness of this movie jacks up to ten. After many Hits later as well as an assassination on Don Corleone (which greatly upset me for some reason...), We cut to Michael Corleone (played superbly by Al Pacino) the youngest son in the Corleone family who resents the family buisness until an act of revenge unwitingly consumes him (mentally) beyond the return of normailty. We cut to Michael's new life as well as Vito recouperating, ""Don"" Vito expresses great upset that this fate has befallen Michael as he never wanted Michael to get involved with the family buisness. Michael has now become a shell of his former joyful self, yet he has built a life for himself while in hiding. All the meantime a montage of hits is carried out by all of the five families which ultimately ends up bringing more tragedy to all the Corleone family. Eventually it finally leads to a cause of action in which Vito ensures the protection of every family within the Mafioso (an intresting note that the word ""Mafia"" is never uttered in the movie). Since then Michael has returned and is now the ""Don"" of the Corleone family and is allowing the five families to run the Corleone's resources dry, After Vito sadly passes away Michael begins his plan... As we see in a bloody montage Michael has had all other heads of the five families brutally murdered while he is attending a Christening no less. Ensuring he's place as the strongest ""Don"" to the remaing families as a door swings closed to his now realising wife... Something of a Masterpiece when the film came out back in 1972, ""The Godfather"" has only gotten better of age, There are so mny iconic quotes and moments in the movie, And the cast is just fantastic, like one of the best ever put to film, James Caan I HARDLY RECOGNIZED and Robert Duvall was just as brilliant as always. But obviously the biggest argument, Is this movie Brando's or Pachno's? Personally i thought Brando, he was just incredible as always and totally deserved the Oscar he turned down, both nevertheless unforgetable on Screen. The pacing was impeccable as well as the locations that are all shot beautiful, some part of me does feel that he film is a bit too long, However alot does happen and to be honest I'm looking really forward to seeing Part 2 + 3. The music was fantastic, it helped bring the authenticity out of the picture and into the deep parts of my brain, I colud listen to the ""Love theme"" all day... As said earlier the movie is about the Dynasty of the family, the Buisness of the family, the Vengence of the family e.t.c. So many themes are present and so much are explored, every gangster film ever made owes someting to ""The Godfather"". Final Verdict: Probably the first modern Gangster epic ever made, As Stanley Kubrick said ""Probably the finest Cast ever assembled).",positive
One film that the creators of cinema will find impossible to replicate. This is a film that has just seeped into our collective mindset. Regardless of the geographical location of the film watchers; The Godfather has affected everyone in some way or the other. The film is a treat for the senses thanks to the most evocative set design by Dean Tavoularis and dark and brooding photography by Gordon Willis. A classic script which would have made Shakespeare proud; The Godfather is filled with generation-defining characters and iconic dialogues. Coppola ensured that he will never be forgotten by millions of people across the globe. As long as cinema lives; The Godfather will stand tall.,positive
"Best movie ever starring Marlon Brand, ""I will give him an offer he will never refuse."" Also starring James Caan, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall with Sterling Hayden and John Cazale.",positive
ain't nothin better.,positive
If you have not seen this movie yet stop right now and go out and watch it. Truly a classic and one of the greatest films ever made. I love this movie to death and everyone should watch it. I will make an offer you can't refuse if I have to.,positive
"Sin duda una de las obras más grandes del septimo arte. Lo que me encanta de esta película es el manejo de temas sociales como ""la familia"", ""el valor"", ""la infidelidad"" y ""el destino"". Diria que la frase que mejor se aplica en todo el film es ""no digas -de esa agua no he de beber... por que terminas ahogado"". En ningún momento te aburrirás en esta cinta, pues cada minuto aparece una situación que atrapará sin duda alguna tu atención. El final es uno de los mas grandes de la historia, no sin dejar atras un dialogo en la escena inicial que al ponerle atención te narrará horrores de lo que habeses es un mundo cruel.",positive
"This is truly one of the greatest films ever produced. Having had the privilege to read the original screenplay, as written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, I truly believe that this is a tour de force in film.",positive
"What can I say that hasn't already been said? ""The Godfather is a cincematic masterpiece that will be remembered for generations. With outstanding performances by Marlon Brando and Al pacino and a plot that shows an accurate description of what life was like for Americans in the 1940's makes ""The Godfather"" reign as the best movie ever made.",positive
Only by a half a step worse than Part II thou it is enjoyable even more watchable and Marlon Brando is great.,positive
"I saw this movie for the first time about two years ago, and since then I've seen it three more times. The reputation it has earned is completely accurate, this is without a doubt the best mafia movie ever made, if not one of the greatest movies of all time, and my second favorite movie (beaten only by Midnight Cowboy, but they're very different movies). The plot is very complex and deep, filled with themes of family, betrayal, and power. You notice something new each time you watch the movie. The acting is fantastic, especially from the legendary Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather himself. The characters are all very complicated and dynamic, many of them changing drastically over the course of the movie. The script is also incredible, with every line of dialogue feeling perfectly written. The movie has many violent scenes, but it is far from tasteless. The movie has enough bloodshed to keep it interesting and accurately depict the mafia life, but the violence is never intentionally overdone. The long running time may be a turn-off for some, but once the movie ends you'll love it enough to wish it never had to end. Luckily, there is a sequel that is just as good as this movie, and as long as you ignore the unnecessary third movie, the first two movies wrap things up perfectly.",positive
"It's severely overrated, but The Godfather is still a finely-crafted story of the Italian mafia and betrayal. Marlon Brando manages to be both kind-hearted and fearful as Don Corleone, while Al Pacino's character goes through a large change in morality and ethics by the end of the story. In the end, it's a great watch.",positive

Our classic mafioso - and it always will be.,positive
"I've been skeptical of this movie my whole life, thinking much of the fanhood was based on the cliche Mafia representation resonating with everyone's idolization of Mob bosses. I finally gave it a chance today, and I must say it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. The moving plot and the incredible insight into the workings of Mafia families is impeccable.",positive
"Performances, plot, and a perfect execution, The Godfather isn't just one of the greatests movies of all time, it set the standard for all movies to come.",positive
"Grade: A+ (100%) The Godfather is one of America's classic movies can we can safely call a masterpiece. Everything is mostly perfect in this film about a King and his three sons in the mafia. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in this fantastic performance) is celebrating his daughter's wedding. Hundreds of people, including the F.B.I., join the party in celebration. But behind closed doors, Vito is having meetings with people who need favors. ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" is the words that Vito (also known as The Godfather) says to his friend. We see the heads of the five families at this party along with Vito's sons. Fredo, the wimpy son, Sonny as the aggressive son, Tom Hagen the lawyer of the family who was taken in by Vito, and Michael as the WWII hero of the family. But when Vito denies partnership with Solanzo, a violent man who deals with narcotics, he is badly wounded in an assassination attempt. This is where Michael (Al Pacino in his great movie debut) comes in and shows how his life of heroic attempts turn into a dark descent into his father's business. The Godfather works in every way. Whether it is the violent scene of being strangled by a thin wire or hearing ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" throughout the film, The Godfather will keep you entertained. It is a 3 hour film but it never feels like a bore in any way. Each scene is there with a purpose and each one gives new detail into each main character. The film is backed up with fine performances all around. Marlon Brando is great as The Godfather (Vito Corleone) and won Best Actor for his role. Al Pacino is fantastic in this movie. He nails every scene as we see Michael switch between the light (War Hero) and dark side (Mafia). He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor but did not win. The Godfather is a masterpiece. The movie works in every way. It was the Best Picture in 1972 and is considered the second best film of all time (should be #1 but we won't talk about Citizen's Kane). There is no excuse if you never see this film - watch it, enjoy it, and love it. But once done don't stop there. Part II is just as good or (in my opinion) better than the original.",positive
"The most numbing suspense in Francis Ford Coppola's maddeningly dark fable comes with the realization of how stricken by reality each of the characters is. That when his mobster daddy (Marlon Brando) is taken within an inch of his life, son Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is just fighting to keep his family's empire and declarations from shooting straight down the tubes. A screenwriter's only as smart as his characters, and there's a reason ""The Godfather"", of its many inspired artwork, is perhaps best identified with a puppet-master pulling strings. The Corleone dynasty is a dwindling conspiracy, and Coppola's hilarious, troubling, and disturbing hypothesis takes strides as heated as cinema at its boldest, no ifs, ands, or buts about it...well, it's probably still matched by ""Apocalypse Now"". But that's only if you're asking me.",positive
Still prefer Goodfellas.,positive

Well ahead of time...the movie which made me turn bak and start right from the 70's...,positive
"WOO HOO I've reached 100 reviews and I'd thought I'll celebrate by reviewing a classic. THE GODFATHER. The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that. The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination. But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability. As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years. The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two. However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing. To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against. I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible. There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable. The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous. The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.",positive
"Absolutely a favorite. It'll stand the test of time. So believable. Not one ounce of bad acting to the point I thought everything was real. A great story that placed us inside the eyes of mobsters. They made mobsters lovable people that we wanted to win. Everyone paid attention to everything and didn't miss a thing, but also didn't try too hard. It just worked. Best movie ever made. Period.",positive
One of the best movies ever made. Still unbelievable.,positive
"Considered as one of the best films in amercian cinema and one of my personal favorites. The Godfather is an epic crime tale about family, trust, and betrayal based in 1940's New York. Winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1972. The Godfather to me personally is the best amercian film ever made!",positive
Marlon Brando IS the Godfather,positive
"A great masterpiece of filmmaking. The performances where just jaw drooping, and it made you want to see more until the end. Definitely one of Coppola's best work that serves as an example to all directors how to make a great story that can beat the test of time. Mario Puzo has written one of the most interesting novels due to its realism and complexity of character development. A must-see film to all movie critics!",positive
"Never has there been a film (nor will be) that comes close in GOD status to this film. If I were asked what film I'd watch before I die, it would definitely, beyond a shadow of a doubt be this film.",positive
my faverit film of all time THE GODFATHER,positive
"The Godfather an epic film that defined a genre and for good reasons. The performances are top notch, the cinematography is breathtaking, the story is epic and it is amazingly put together. It may have dated a bit as far as violence goes but after an ending like that there really isn't a lot not to love about The godfather.",positive
"A masterpiece, with wonderful performances from a great cast, a nearly perfect screenplay filled with unforgettable lines, directed by Coppola at the top of his game.",positive
"I do appreciate that Peter Griffin does not care for this film. I, however, liked it very much, and missed James Caan in the later films.",positive

"The Godfather may be the most perfect film ever made and it is listed as Number Two on The American Film Institute's (AFI) 100 greatest films of all time. It should be Number One! There is not a single scene in this three hour masterpiece that doesn't belong there. And it is filled with quotes that we still repeat today. I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse; Never let anyone outside of the family know what you're thinking; and It's not personal, it's only business are just a few that come to mind. Those quotes and the body of work from which they come is a great testament to Mario Puzo who wrote this tremendous blockbuster book in 1971. But blockbuster book or not, it takes a great director to transfer that writing to the screen and make it an engrossing visual experience that the audience can enjoy during those three hours. And that tribute goes to writer/director Francis Ford Coppolla who had the vision and tenacity to film the movie as an epic period story of a crime family in the forties instead of a cops and robbers run of the mill gangster contemporary picture which was what Paramount studios had envisioned. In fact, Coppola was on the verge of being fired several times while making this film as the book was becoming a bigger and bigger best seller so he had to work fast. He had only been hired because he was the only Italian director on the lot at the time. He had writing credits on previous films and had recently won the academy award for writing the screen play for Patton but this was his first directorial assignment. Even so, it is difficult to believe that this monumental work was shot in just some forty days. His casting of the actors was faultless and it included Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Richard Castellano, Diane Keeton, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden, Al lettieri, John Marley, Richard Conte, Al Martino and many other great character driven performances by others. His suspenseful pacing of the movie is astonishing as he keeps moving the story foreword refusing to allow viewers enough time to even leave their seat to buy some popcorn or maybe to visit the rest room. And most importantly, everything makes sense in the end as the director ties up all the loose ends and brings the story to its spectacular climactic close. This film was a gigantic success for everyone. The movie page every day for months had one big headline running across the top exclaiming that Marlon Brando is The Godfather! It made Mario Puzo a lot of money because this book was his first commercial success. He had written a few critically acclaimed novels previously but none ever made any money. In his previous book, he had written a chapter or two about the mafia and a friend suggested that he should write a whole book on the subject. And so he did. The film served as a comeback vehicle for Marlon Brando whose career was moving downward due to his past reputation of driving up the costs of a movie because of his eccentric behavior. It launched the career of Al Pacino who, in only his second film, was able to match, toe to toe, the enormous talent of Brando who is considered by many to be the greatest actor of his generation. And it made stars of all the other actors who went on to great successful careers. There are five mafia families in New York City in 1945 and Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of the most powerful family of them all. His connections include the police, city officials, newspapermen, congressmen and the judges that sit on the court. He has a reputation of being a fair minded man who seeks only justice and respect from his family and friends but who is also capable of being ruthless if the situation demanded. He is a man who thinks with logic and reasoning and bases his decisions on the wisdom he has gained through his life experiences. He has three sons, one of whom (Caan) is being groomed to take his place when that time comes and another son (Cazale) who is considered mentally unfit for that role. His youngest son (Pacino) has just returned home from the armed forces with a medal of honor earned during the second world war. His dream is that this son and war hero remain outside of the family business so that he might become a governor or a senator and bring a legitimacy to the family name. The movie begins with his daughter's wedding at which time the Sicilian custom is that he must grant the wishes of all those who come to him for advice and who seek his aid and it is here in the first scene in a darkened room where we see the absolute power that is in the possession of this man and the suppressed fear that is on some of the faces of those who come before him. One request comes from his godson (Martino) who is an entertainer and singer in show business. This character is obviously based on Frank Sinatra who had been known to have ties to the mob in real life and it was widely known that Sinatra was not happy being portrayed in this fashion. The producer (Marley) of a new movie will not give him a part in a film that he is perfect for and which would resurrect his career so he has come to his godfather for help. The godfather's answer to the problem involves a multi-million dollar race horse that is owned by that producer and an invasion into his private home and bedroom. After the wedding, the Don is visited by a gangster (Lettieri) who is seeking financing and protection from him in order to form a highly profitable narcotics distribution network in the city. Al Lettieri under the direction of Coppola is very transforming in this role and his true Sicilian background in real life along with his menacing eyes and facial expressions portray him as a sinister man who would stop at nothing to get what he wants. When Corleone refuses his request on the grounds that narcotics is a dirty business and will result in the loss of his political connections, he is later gunned down at night outside of his office. He is shot several times but still manages to survive and is hospitalized for an extended period. At this point, a long war breaks out between the five families and rival gang members are murdered on the streets of New York City and the question becomes one as to which family will end up on top. The Don's son, who is now the head of the family while his father recuperates and is well known for his violent temper is trapped and killed at a highway toll booth where he is slaughtered by a relentless stream of machine gun bullets. Devastated by his son's death, The Don, instead of seeking revenge, now calls for a meeting of the heads of all the families for the purpose of ending the gang war because he sees no value in the shedding of more blood. A truce is called and harmony is reached at least for a little while until Don Corleone dies of a heart attack. THE BOTTOM LINE? I have just given you a short outline of this story because it is best viewed and enjoyed in its entirety from beginning to end like a sparkling glass of red vintage wine. Everything in this film is simply magnificent giving us fantastic actors, an extraordinary imaginative story, excellent direction, remarkable editing and creative costume design. The film will draw you in immediately with its many characters and its period scenery of Little Italy in New York City in the forties. And the phenomenal music score by Nino Rota sets the mood perfectly and appropriately for both romance and danger whenever they are each present. When the movie is over, you will probably want to see it again right away so that you can focus perhaps on someone else in the film who turned out to be something you did not expect. And at the end, you will know each character in great detail and you will understand what they did and why they did it. And you will perhaps feel somewhat overwhelmed by the experience of what you have just witnessed. I know that almost everyone has probably seen this movie but I wrote this review just in case there are a few out there who haven't. This movie has everything. It has love of family, romance, betrayal, treachery, revenge, murder, loyalty and honor. This film is one that all other crime films (and non crime films) will forever be compared to and measured by and it is the number one essential film that must be seen by anyone who enjoys excellence on the movie screen.

"The Godfather is such a classic because it thoroughly explores all the dimensions of its characters. Old world gentility and savage crime. Virtuous morality and ruthless calculation.

What a direction from Francis Ford Coppola, one hell of cinematography and art-direction, the beginning scene and the 5 Heads of Mafia Families round-table meeting scene are dramatic in cinema-history. The scene where Corleone informs Michael about Barzini's treacherous move followed by playing with grandson both in lawn, are classically grand. Film is grand really!",positive
Literally fantastic. There is nothing else I can say that can do justice to how good this really is.,positive
"One of the greatest movies ever made. A lot of my generation hasn't seen this movie and I feel so fortunate for being one of the few who have. I do admit, it's not for everyone.",positive
"I don't think it's the bulletproof masterpiece many have claimed it to be, but it is a great movie, and I liked it more than I expected to. It's essentially the best cast ever assembled for a movie, in terms of both talent and performance. The story is terrific, the characters are very memorable, and I constantly felt like I was there because of the overall authenticity. Pacino and Brando, in particular, were incredible. I have some minor issues with it, though. When Carlo gets his ass beaten in the street, that was one of the worst fake fights I've ever seen, with punches and kicks not even coming close. I also thought Michael's meteoric rise should have been well documented, but it was largely skipped, and thus we didn't get the full effect of his transformation. A little of the sharpness of the movie is lost as well after the halfway point - it's still good, but it's a little less crisp and a little too nonchalant in comparison to the stellar first half. Again, these aren't a big deal to me, but it shows that movies are never perfect, just perfect for certain people. And 95% of this movie is pretty damn awesome. I want to wait awhile before I watch Part II, but given that I had no interest in watching this one in the first place, it had to be quite an achievement for me to want to pursue the sequel.",positive
This my shit right here.. Straight gangsta.,positive
A fantastic movie with an incredible cast.,positive
"The Godfather is one of the most daunting films I've ever reviewed. Honestly there is nothing I can say that other critics haven't been saying for the past 41 years, however I will try to put into words how imperative that it is that everyone see this film. Let's begin with the plot. The movie follows an aging patriarch of crime family who through a series of events must teach his youngest son how to run the business. If you've seen the film, you know this synopsis does not do it justice. There are so many nuances within the story that make multiple viewing an absolute necessity. I've seen it three times now, and each time there is something new to notice. The pacing is also perfect and doesn't make the 3 hour plus runtime tedious at all. This leads me to the direction. Coppola is a master behind the camera. The editing and shots are flawless. The scene at the end that takes place during a christening is one of the most suspense filled and perfect scenes, ever. What also helps the film a great deal is the music. The score is one of those classic Italian sounding soundtracks. It helps immerse you into this world, and it also helps propel those emotional scenes to another level altogether. Finally I want to wrap up with the acting. Marlon Brando gives the performance of his career as Don Vito Corleone. He is flawlessly able to portray both the tough business side and the quite, sad, family-oriented side of this character. There is a reason this performance seems to be a go to whenever someone wants to impersonate a mob boss. Al Pacino is also excellent as Michael Corleone. Pacino, who was an unknown at this time, displays the confliction Michael feels with his father's business perfectly. Another person who I think does an excellent job, but is often overlooked is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. He often has intimate scenes with Brando's Vito and he is able to hold his own next to this flawless presence, and that shouldn't be overlooked. I know throughout this review I have used words like ""perfect"" and ""flawless"" at every turn, but there is honestly no other way to describe it. I would buy this movie a thousand times over and still remains one of my favorites of all time. If you haven't watched it, put down whatever you're doing and put it in your Netflix queue or get it from your local video story because you will not regret it.",positive

"one of the few ""5 star"" ratings I will give.",positive
"The Godfather is considered the greatest film of all time, and it definently lives up to the title, from people, to critics, and to me. The stopry of The Godfather is the world of organized crime, the don Vito Corleone if the head of the Corleone crime family, and is respected and honest don. His youngest son Micheal Corleone is the youngest boy of the family and is a returning war hero with a beautiful woman who never entered the family business. Once his father is shot and lives but becomes very hurt, Micheal decides to protect him and is soon taken into the world of organized crime. The plot is a brilliant genius movie story with characters that you remember, dislike, like, and want dead. Marlon Brando won an Oscar for this role, and is probably the most rememebered actor in the whole series, and he truly lives up to that because his grief stricken and genius performance is great. Al Pacino is tremendous and truly was made a star with this film. James Caan was great too, I think a lot of people overlook his performance because he's a big part of the movie too. From an offer he couldn't refuse, to the horse head, to the shooting at a diner, and to the car bomb, ths is truly the worlds greatest organized crime film ever (next to Goodfellas), and even though its not my favorite film ever, its by far the only film ive ever seen that lives up to the title ""Greatest Film Ever Made.""",positive
It's a little confusing and a little overrated but still good.,positive
"I absolutely loved it. The story is slightly confusing and thats mostly down to the fact that there is so many characters, but that doesn't stop this from being absolutely brilliant. All actors give stunning performances, especially Brando and Pacino, that really helps keeps the film progress smoothly. Absolutely essential.",positive
"The best gangster movie ever made. Wonderful performances from Brando, Pacino and the rest of the cast, including Sofia Coppola as the baby *boy!* in the baptism sequence, which is my favorite part. Overall, everyone must see this movie, period.",positive
The best film ever made IMO. A true masterpiece!,positive
"One of the greatest movies of all time. The crime, the mafia, murder. This movie follows te book closely.",positive
"Few year ago i made a mistake when i watched this movie just after i read the book and thougth that this is a crap movie, but if you dont do it you will see very well that this is pure classic and have everything what is need for good movie",positive
"Greatest movie ever? Yeah, pretty much.",positive
"Best movie ever made. To the American Film Institute: while Citizen Kane is very good, The Godfather is better. Please make it #1 when you redo your list in 8 years.",positive
One of the few films ever made that deserve to be called epic. Pacino and Brando are flawless. Their acting is downright intimidating. Also the diner scene is one of the most memorable in cinema.,positive
Why are there so many oranges?,positive
"An all-time great, so was the 2nd. This is not as good as the 2nd one is/was, but it does what it has to, it set's the story for the Corleone family. The conversion in this film for Michael is what spells everything out. The revenge. Pacino's best work was done with these two film (GF 1 & 2).",positive
Just perfect! We will not have another one like this one!,positive
Finally saw this after having the movies as a box set for several months. I can totally understand the hype - especially if I were to put myself back in the time the movie was released. It was probably the only one of its kind. Brilliant actors - the majority of whom I could recognise and therefore could understood the calibre of cast here. The story was understandable - if the dialogue wasn't sometimes. But a true classic in the actual sense of the word. A must see just to say you've seen it. This one in particular is my favourite of the three.,positive
"Marlon Brando & Al Pacino were just brilliant in the movie.It's the best movie i've ever seen in Hollywood.Also,The dialogue Marlon Brando a.k.a on Don Vito Corleone's often said on the movie was really just bravo.""Iâ(TM)ll make him an offer he canâ(TM)t refuse"".",positive
The most perfectly made film that has ever been made. Its unquestionable,positive
"Directed by Francis Ford Coppola Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard S. Castellano, Diane Keaton and Abe Vigoda. The Godfather is a brilliant film. It cannot be overemphasized enough, the inescapable fate of Michael Corleone to rule his father's empire, the dramatic fall of Vito Corleone from power and prominence, the conflict between brothers Michael and Sonny for this very power, the love of Michael and Kay Adams perhaps set apart by the film's chain of events, and countless other power struggles, fateful upbringings, and social hierarchy and order. But if only the presentation, forged by director Francis Ford Coppola, could meet the the requirements of presenting such cumbersome content. At the end of the day, any film has to entertain us to carry it's contents to shore. This is not seen in The Godfather. Coppola takes his time, panning out events as though they were part of a grand dramatic saga, or more that is what we are supposed to think. Ultimately, this is a 3 hour film containing all filler, with it's storyline and plot-line stretched out thin like only silly putty can be. The fact that the sensible viewer will be ready to tap out twenty minutes into the long dreary conversation scenes, and poor attempt at something akin to European Realism, may be a testimony to the film's ultimate quality, and how it insults film's long held hallmark of great entertainment. The content is surely there for a legend in film-making. And that content has indeed gotten this film and it's sequel places. But from a more critical viewer's perspective, the presentation of the film is fairly small. What can be ultimately taken away from this film, is that presentation in a film must always be able to equal the content, or the film is a disaster. Of course millions of the Godfather's male fans will not agree with me on such an issue. But what do they know about understanding this film. For the most part, their testosterone and manly egos fuel their understanding of film. There is no subject among university courses called Philosophy of Film. But as far as this subject would be concerned, the presentation must always measure up to the content in a film, and this one has very well established just that. Of course as mentioned earlier, The Godfather has legions of male fans who devote their very lives to this film. To these men this film is an orgy of pleasure and sensation, that is even better than sex at times. But from the quality, and I mean quality, viewer's perspective: this film is nothing more than an ambitious presentation of cumbersome content gone all wrong. You can present all sorts of facets of human interaction and chemistry in a film, and make that film have deep cerebral meaning. But it is how these matters are tied into, explained and exposed in the film. Everywhere in our world today, there is fate, power, human interaction. It is then the job of the motion picture to present these matters in cinema's own entertaining and intuitive way. This or else film would be pointless as a whole. Portraying Con-men as humans, families struggling through hard times, is not invigorating at all, rather these matters are simply gentle and heartfelt, nothing more. Such basic human struggles can be portrayed by any hard-nosed director, no matter how much talent he has. Coppola, a Hollywood Household name, has really just assembled a complex mush-mash of who-knows-what, that at most can be made out to be a long and dreary film depiction of crime syndicates and con-men mooning around, carrying out their daily lives. As though this would ever mean anything at all to audiences who watch it. Keiko's score 72-100",negative
What can I say that hasn't already been said? The Godfather is amazing and inspiring.,positive
It insists upon itself.,negative
"I can honestly say that this is definitely one of my favorite films. Not one minute of this film seemed pointless to me. The acting is top notch with (in my opinion) Al Pacino's best performance. Another thing I love about this movie is that the characters keep you guessing what they're going to do next. This film is hands down, Francis Ford Coppola's finest work, and i can probably watch one hundred times and never get tired of it.",positive
"The Godfather is the Godfather of all mafia films. It's better than Goodfellas, and Casino. Everything is done to a tee, the acting, the era setting, the plot, the development of characters. It's all there and makes for a fast three hour film. I was almost ready to put in Godfather part 2 immediately after. I can't really go into how great this movie was or else I would be writing a massive article. If you enjoy classic films, or gangster films, you will love this movie. And if you love other genres, you will still love this movie.",positive
i will make an offer he can't refuse. This is really mafia.,positive
I think when people say they don't like The Godfather they're doing it to mess with me because any other explanation in unacceptable,positive
Without a question one of the greatest cinematic marvels to ever grace the screen.,positive
Absolutely loved this movie. Although it was super long every second of the movie was interesting and related to the bigger picture. Excited to see part 2 & 3.,positive
Goodfellas is way better.,negative
With out a doubt the besst movie ever made.,positive
Best mobster movie ever. Nothing but good things to say.,positive
"im gonna go ahead and say that this is a perfect film. pacino and the rest of the cast are wonderful and the script is out of this world,",positive
"The Godfather is my favoraite gangster film of all time.Al Picino did a fantastic performance, and it is due Francis Ford Coppla crisp direction.",positive
Excellent Book. Fantastic Film. Set the precedent for the modern Crime film.,positive
"Saw it at 13, didn`t like it! Needless to say I have kinda warmed to it since then.",positive
best fuckin movie in the world,positive
who could resist al pacino??,positive
One of the greatest films ever made.,positive
Its one of the one of the best movies that I have watched in my life.,positive
The Godfather is undoubtedly the magnum opus of Twentieth-Century cinema. An absolute masterpiece.,positive
"Simply put, the greatest film ever made, and one that is timeless, and as close to perfect as you can get. Be it the story-line, casting, direction, etc., etc.",positive
The undisputed champion of Gangster movies. This classic has never been touched and never will. Ima make him an offer he cant refuse.,positive
"Probably one of the best, if not the best, films ever made. It's a strong gangster film that focuses more on the meaning of family and the ties that bind which makes it a unique masterpiece. Pacino is great coming into his own, Brando is masterful as the head of the Corleone family, and all the others (Caan, Duvall, Shire) play their roles with a confidence that is swift and evoking. It's spanning time of 3 hours almost seems to be not enough for this crime saga that is watchable over and over for me. I loved the plot, the vying of families in NY, the set pieces, the cinematography (scenes especially in which Pacino transforms into the new don and brando is in his dying state are epically captured) and above all the directing is top notch. This movie is one of my favorites and would definately be a great reccommendation to anyone looking for a great film that not only captures the essence of love, hate, violence, revenge, and non other, family...",positive
"Along with Casablanca, a movie that I can watch over and over. Sometimes I'll put it on just to have in the background. Can't imagine ever getting tired of watching it.",positive
Filme Sensacional! AtuaÃ§Ã£o colossal de Marlon Brando.,positive

"Brutal, brilliant and bloody great. Francis Ford Coppola and a fantastic cast make some amazing performances. Classic!",positive
Very good movie. I can see why it's a classic.,positive
"The plot, the acting, the dialogue, the intensity, all well structured. This epic mafia film can only be described in one word; Perfection!",positive
Debatably the most perfect film in cinema as far as film production goes. So it is kind of ok I guess.,positive
"The Godfather: One of cinemas greatest efforts. What else can I say that hasn't already been said? Let's give it a go The acting is brilliant, from Brando to Pacino, everyone acts above and beyond making us care for the characters and the tradgedies they endure. Especially James Caan as Sonny, giving one of the best performances I have seen, especially with his protective nature for his sister. This film alone has given cinema some of the greatest scenes in history: the baptism and execution (who'd have thought those two would interact so brilliantly), the opening scene, when Sonny is beating the crap out of wife beater Carlo is a personal favourite of mine. The entirety of this film seems like a gift to pop culture, what with it's famous lines (""I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse""), their sayings (sleeps with the fishes) and the scenes (the car exploding, the horse head in the bed, baptism & fire, sonnys death). It has to be one of pop cultures most used references (along with Star Wars) From the opening scene where the undertaker is asking Don Corleone to kill the boys who beat his daughter, the sad tale he weaves is interacted brilliantly by the Godfathers demand for respect. It is from this opening scene that I knew every good thing i'd heard about this movie was true. It didn't take a huge heist or one big action sequence to draw me in, it merely took a brilliant scene where two characters talk. One theme that seems to be huge within this film: Family, that family is the most important thing anyone can have. That is an astounding theme to have in a mob film, and surprisingly, it works. It fully works, and you can see it through the entire film, like how the Don would refuse to have the group photo taken because Michael was not there, because the entire family was not present. The contrast with the beginning of the film and the films end is astounding. Note how in the beginning, Michael is telling Kay everything about the family and their business, as well as mentioning that he is not a murderer like them. Then at the end, he doesn't tell Kay anything and even lies to her, and had ordered the deaths of all those people, including Carlo, especially as how he had become the Godfather, the new Don Corleone. Family was pretty much the most important thing to Vito Corelone, so it was nice that he died peacefully, playing with his grandson as opposed to in a violent assasination due to his work in the mob. I enjoyed that. There was a part I didn't like about this movie, but I was overjoyed to see it rectified during the end. The fact that wifebeater Carlo was left alive AND working with Michael. I was so glad to see Michael was actually clued in and ordered his death, and I am sorry I have doubted this film. Can you believe that some people actually find this film boring? They don't know what a real movie is. If you haven't seen this film, go watch it, it deserves to be watched by every single person in exsitence. God, I love this movie!",positive
Whats to say. Everyone has already said it. Perfect. Genious. Art.,positive
SOOO GOOD. Just got to see it in Norris theater. Awesome.,positive
"Wonderful! I mean everything, the story, the acting, the violence. This is a movie that you may not like on the first viewing, like me. After I saw this, the ending left me with a ""What the hell?"" then a ""Eh, it was okay."" I felt for the characters but not for the story. So I rewatched it, and I loved abosoulutely every minute of it. I really like the wedding scenes at the beginning. Becuase, not only was the music catchy but it also introduced us to all the characters. I loved the fact where I actually KNEW the characters names, some movies people don't really get a good introduction or even an introduction at all. I find myself filled with anger when Carlo beat Connie with his, belt. I wanted Sonny to come and beat the crap out of him again. Well it comes down to this, watch this movie. But be prepared, if you have to give it a second viewing.",positive

"Wow it is truly amazing to see a movie have it's 40 year anniversary and it is still considered one of the best films made in the world. The Godfather projects an image into all of minds that makes us just want to see more. It's over all a perfect film and there is no hesitation to say this...The Godfather is (according to me) the best movie of all time. My dad saw this movie when he was 9 years old and back then it was his favorite movie and still is. Now 40 years later I can say that The Godfather is my favorite movie. Francis Ford Coppola has given fans a movie not to complain about. From the very beginning you are just sitting there looking at the screen saying what's going to happen next! And throughout the whole film that's what you keep on saying to yourself. The music, the actors, the characters, the story, and the filming are just incredible. If you havent seen this film then sit the hell down and watch the all-time master piece....The Godfather.",positive
For me it was paced a bit too slow. The acting was amazing. Just look at the cast. The film kept those who knew the eventual endings on the edge of their seats. Just a great film not much more to say about a movie when everything in the movie works. Everything.,positive
my favorite movie of all time just perfect,positive
"I'm a dude; I have to like this movie. It is a rite of passage. A fantastic cast with a wonderful story. I read the book many years after first seeing the movie. This was the first movie I got into with Brando. Long ago, I used to rent this and Godfather II and just watch them over and over during the three days I was permitted to have the movies. This movie tells a family's story and has become part of our culture. How many lines are used in our language? Awesome!",positive

you can call this one literally the godfather of all the mafia movies that exist to this day.,positive
What more is there to say... Quite frankly its one of the best motion pictures ever made. The story is gripping and the acting is excellent. One or two moments where the special effects arent up to today's standard... but I think we can forgive that.,positive

"Don't get me wrong, it's still a great movie, but there are better crime movies out there, The Godfather is far too tame compared to todays standards. Yes it is has been highly influential, important and original but times have changed...",positive
"Very well-acted and beautifully filmed. The last hour seemed to drag, though. Maybe I just couldn't put myself enough in a 1970s frame of mind to see how groundbreaking this film was.

"I must be one of the last people to watch this film. This film was a bit of a let down but it is still a good film my issue with this film is it was not that exciting and for a mobster film that is rare. The story is okay not that strong or as good as I had thought that it would be. The acting is great though just a strong cast. The characters are not great but okay far from bad. Overall this film is just over the line of okay, but this is still a good Mafia movie and I will watch the 2nd film in the series as a matter of fact I look forward to it, A good mafia film overall and I do suggest it for the people who have not seen this film it is a good one no doubt!",negative

"Oh goodness, I hope I don't get stoned for a 90%. I love Marlon Brando, and there are quotes upon cultural benchmarks created from this film. So yes, I get that it's cinematic gold. I'm just not that into it personally. So 90% on account of taste.",positive
Dar cinco estrelas para O Poderoso Chefão é tão redundante...,positive
1 of 5 of my all time favoriates!,positive
"This is the classic movie of modern American cinema. It features an excellent moral story of defending ones family as opposed to doing what is right. The film features an ensamble cast of individuals who are known best from being in this film as well as being great actors separately. The cast features Al Pacino, Marlin Brando, James Caen, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, and Diane Keaton. Marlin Brando delivers a performance of a life time in transforming himself into Vito Corleone. Although the other do not reach this same level, their performances are spectacular. The film does not feature any major flaws! It is long and dialogue driven. This film definitely is not for the average movie go-er who expects to be constantly entertained. This demands more from the viewer but also offers more in substance.",positive
"Meh. Maybe we just grew up with this being in existence so it didn't impress us as much, but aside from the music, it's overrated.",negative
"One of the greatest films of all fucking time, a cinematic masterpiece only bested by my biased love for Star Wars. This film is the work of a god, everything about it is fucking amazing. I was floored the first time I saw this movie and I finally understood why my dad was so obsessed with this film: it's just flat-out fucking amazing. If you haven't seen, do it NOW, before you find yourself sleeping with the fishes.",positive
"Deep, compelling, and full of Italians, Godfather is the classic everyone knows and loves. While it is a tad overrated, it still has a reason it has gained critical acclaim.",negative
What a great movie. The story was very compelling and deserves its place as one of the top movies of all time. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando were magnificent especially the latter. The acting all around was superb and the pace of the story was excellent. A must see for all. 9.2/10,positive
The Godfather maybe a classic but not as amazing as they say as I lost interest half-way through and it dragged on too long. Despite that it's still great.,positive
Everything in The Godfather to me is flawless.Acting top class.Francis Ford Coppola is a master of the camera.Top notch movie 5/5,positive
Do I really even need to say anything here/,positive
"Shockingly I have never seen any of the Godfather movies, Scarface etc. My first jaunt into the classic 70's Mafia films is the iconic ""The Godfather directed by Francis Ford Coppola and staring Marlon Brando and a very young Al Pacino. I now totally understand why this movie has held such a respected place in the history of American movies. There was not a single aspect of the movie I can really find fault with. The acting was superb by all the main characters and even by most of the support characters. Brando did a great job playing an aging man in the waning days of his life. Pacino's character grew and changed as the movie progressed. The progression was told not only with the plot and dialog but with Pacino's emotions and expressions as well. After the attempted assassination of his father, he progresses from being the war hero son who wants nothing to do with the family business, to being the head, the Don. The transition is evident in his political vision of a retaliation strike. It becomes even more so when he negotiates with a man to court his daughter. At the end of the movie when the transition is complete you see that deep down he still wants to be seen, at least by his wife, as the innocent war hero he was. It seems that his wife, naively and despite all evidence to the contrary, wishes to believe it too. The cinematography is well done, for the time, and the lighting worked beautifully the whole movie to set the mood for each scene. The movie is a whopping three hours long and moves as a moderate pace. However everything works together to make it feel right. The pace and length just work for this movie. If you haven't seen The Godfather before, I highly recommend you do. It is one of the few movies I have seen that truly lives up to its hype. I give it a 9.5 / 10.",positive
"Don Corleone: Some day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, consider this justice a gift on my daughter's wedding day. Indisputably the greatest piece of cinema ever made. A film so engrained in our society, when watching it, its as if you've seen it hundreds of times before. A film is about family more than anything, its importance, its risks and its power. From the second the film opens, to the closing of the door in the final scene, this film does not stop for anything. A rollercoaster of emotions and actions, no other film perfectly blends such an incredible cast, with fantastic acting, one of the most famous scripts in cinema's history and a memorable score. Marlon Brando owns this film. His presence on screen alone is enough to chill the audience, and captivate them in equal measure. The decline into madness from Pacino is equally as gripping, but its the ensemble that keeps the film above all others. It just works, every second, every shot and every line is perfect, and delivered with immense impact and intensity. Even if it isnt your personal favourite film, there is no denying the power of The Godfather. It has become a part of everyone's society, and rightfully so. Cinema at its very very best!",positive
"Great dialogues, great movie love the way Al Pacino and Marlon Brando act their way and others two punch power packed performances and the greatest film ever made i have to agree with it!",positive
This legendary movie was something I simply can't refuse. An epic film worthy of the highest acclaim.,positive

This movie allows us to sympathize with criminals, who are portrayed through a strong family bond, willing to take dangerous risks to protect it. What is there to say about this film that hasn't already been said? This film is without a doubt one of the absolute greatest films ever made.",positive
stupidest movie in the world.,negative
"Let me begin by saying that this is (probably) the best gangster film ever made. Gangsters remain such a fascination among the viewing audience that they are even willing to sit though three hours of dialogue for the now very much cliche garrotings, stabbings and gunfire. This film is widely considered to be among the best (and some say the best) film ever made. This is one of the reasons I will not (or can not) give this film a perfect score. While this is a great film, and it deserves all the homages we have, I am not among the crowd (i.e. the AFI) who think that this is the greatest film of all time. There is a strange hipocracy in Hollywood about film length. Nowadays, we start to cringe when a film exceeds 2 hours 30 minutes. Some of what are now considered the greatest films of all time have some of the least concise and overlong plots. This film, while its story and characters are convincing, it fails to find a concise way to tell its story. Their story is many overstated points about the nature of crime, and, more importantly, family. This film goes on and on, and if there was a cimax, I must have missed it, because whatever violence happens at that point of the story has no more excitement than the violence near the beginning. The climax is supposed to be the peak of the story, and this story is just all one big peak by that definition. The best aspects of this film, however, are the characters. After all, wasn't this the film that was nominated for tons of acting Oscars, most in the wrong category? I do use this film as a textbook example of the Academy Awards placing actors in the wrong categories. While Marlon Brando is the title role, he is not the ""leading"" role. Certainly Al Pacino should have been nominated for ""Best Actor"". Marlon Brando was only in that category because of the title being his character, who just happens to be a supporting character. But anyway, this film has a very well rounded cast, all of whom are characters that could have easily been played as thugs, becoming three dimensional rounded characters who are more like a family than a mob. The violence in this film is really well handled in this film. We don't have drawn out gunfights, or even any fights at all. All the death in this film is a result of one party failing to take certain precautions. There are even several moments in this film where they cleverly avoid gunfights and ""action"" instead going for suspense. The place where this film really falls out of the ""greatest film of all time"" slot in my mind is the message. The message of this film is a ruthless as its violence. We aren't watching a story that is inspiring or hopeful, we're watching the story of the one decent man in the movie descending into depravity. Certainly the greatest film of all time would have a protagonist we would care about or root for, not end up being the person disgusting us with cruelty. Every emotion stimulated in this film is negative. We aren't satisfied by revenge, by the people of the bad side getting what they ""deserve"". This may make it a great film, but not one of the greatest. Overall, everything in this film seems like it should make the greatest film of all time. They just don't. All of the best performances and the best Technical value can't redeem what the film never tries to. Two Thumbs Up.",positive

Some of them will even muster up a quote or two. Such is the worldwide influence of Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The film revolves around the Corleone family, in particular Don Vito Corleone and his sons; Michael, Santino (Sonny) and Fredo and their involvement in a budding mob war. So why is this one piece of cinema so absolutely, world-changingly (yes that's a word... now) good? Let's have a look. <br/> <br/>First of all, the script. Perfectly smearing the line between realistic and stylised, it is THE most quotable gangster movie of all time with lines like ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,"" ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes,"" etc. But it also gives the characters a depth which hundreds of other films have found hard to replicate. Each line is specially crafted for its character and is filled with rich subtext and double meanings. The realism factor means that lines aren't over stylised and polished to within an inch of their life, which helps to create an atmosphere of a slightly elevated reality. <br/> <br/>The acting. It's not often that a filmmaker is granted the use of an ensemble quite as amazing as this, and they are all incredible. Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone has long since passed into cinema immortality as he mumbles his way through the script perfectly. For the most part he is calm, in control. But when moments of anger or sadness come along, he is explosive. His restraint throughout the film is top notch and it makes the more heightened emotional states that much more incredible. The best example of this is in when he's speaking with Johnny Fontane about his part in a film coming up. I'm surprised the screen doesn't shake every time. Al Pacino's Michael is a standout as well, with his cold, calculating personality and fierce protection of his family, as well as a sort of hidden danger inside of him which rears its head occassinally. There are so many layers to his character that you will not get it the first time around. Pacino is at one of the many peaks in his career in this film and its incredible to watch him do what he does. <br/> <br/>The direction is fantastic as well. Coppola manages to keep the audience engaged over the entire epic 3 hours of run time with brilliant lighting and beautiful honeyed tones as well the darker shadowy moments in which nothing is certain. He captures the harshness in both the daytime and the night equally. Just the fact that he took on such an amazing project is kudos enough, that it worked is even better. <br/> <br/>However, as I mentioned, it is 3 hours long, and often there are slow, very slow, moments. But hang in there and you'll be rewarded with having seen one incredible film. <br/> <br/>Francis Ford Coppola's stylised, almost mystical, representation of the American Mafia is a timeless piece of cinema, the likes of which you'll only see every fifty years. Filled with amazing set piece after amazing set piece, if you haven't seen it yet, DO IT NOW! <br/> <br/>Defining Scene: <br/>What, are you kidding? The now immortalised horse's head scene. It'll get you everytime. <br/> <br/>Memorable Quotes: <br/>""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" <br/>""Luca Brasi held a gun to his head and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the contract"" <br/>"" If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you."" <br/>""Fredo, you're my older brother and I love you, but don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever.""",positive

Incredible. I can't believe I have only just seen this movie and it is 38 years old. Loved the horses head scene. Loved the restaurant scene. Great suspense. Great acting.,positive
"The Godfather is absolutely one of the greatest movies of all time. It tells a story that is very legendary and is very well known. Marlon Brando does a great performance along with a great cast including Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and other great performances.",positive
"Great movie, not the best movie, but one of the best. It's a classic and if you're a big fan of the movie, read the book by Mario Puzzo, you'll love it.",positive
"The third in the holy trinity of my favourite films (The Empire Strikes Back and Gladiator completing the list), The Godfather is a master peice in story telling, successfully transferring the meandering narrative of Mario Puzzo's book into two and a half hours of truly compelling film making. Even three decades after it's release, Godfather's stands alone as the quintessential gangster flick, the blue print and standard bearer for all that followed, with only really Goodfellas coming close to matching it's brilliance. However, unlike Goodfellas, Godfather is a cerebral experience with much of the dramatic emphasis and plot development down to gestures and expressions between the ridiculously heavy weight cast (Brando, Caan Pucino, Duvall). With this discernable pattern for the film, it is given to long periods of dialogue and to the more impatient viewer may grow bored. But it is precisely because of these scenes that Godfather truly hits home when the Corleone family does violence or has violence done against it. So unlike many of it's contemporaries, it is not violence for violence's sake, but because it is neccessary contextually. The violence is also specific and targetted, witness Michael execute the currupt policeman himself, neccessary to prove him ready to slip intp his father's shoes, abd the climatic series of executions neccessary to ensure the survival of hid family done amidst a chritening where he is literally sworn in as Godfather to his sister's child. A superlative example of film making, yet to be bettered and by far the genre leader, challenged only by Part 2, but not in my mind.",positive
"""Don Corleone: Someday - and that day may never come - I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this justice as gift on my daughter's wedding day.",positive
"""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. BUT (and I put a huge but), I do not believe it is the greatest movie of all time. WHAT?!?! Here come the FLAMERS! TAKE COVER! Yes, I said it. ""The Godfather"" is not the greatest movie of all time. I agree that ""The Godfather"" is crafted beautifully at an epic scale, but the pacing is much to be desired for and this is merely a Hollywood blockbuster, believe it or not -- albeit, one of the greatest Hollywood blockbusters. Everything, down to the script, narrative, cinematography, camerawork, direction, editing, and acting are all exquisitely done in an immaculate fashion, but that's what ""The Godfather"" merely is: a Hollywood blockbuster. I can't stress this enough. There are plenty of other movies, older and newer, that though genre wise may be different, exceed ""The Godfather"" emotionally, symbolically, and personally. In no way am I trying to stand out among a crowd of ""The Godfather"" lovers, nor am I trying to think that I'm smarter than everyone. Such high talks about such a film comes deserved for sure, but perhaps it may have been a bit over exaggerated in my opinion. Please, don't get me wrong: ""The Godfather"" is an impeccable masterpiece. Masterpiece, it is. Greatest movie of all time, it isn't. With that out of the way, I recommend all filmgoers, young, old, the film noob, the average joe, or the long-time film enthusiast to sulk themselves into this film -- just ignore what everyone says about this movie and watch it as it is.",positive
Possibly the best movie ever made.,positive
Very good but very long !,positive
One of the best movies of all time.,positive
A really great film.,positive
I believe the first is the BEST of them.,positive
"What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't been said? Well, I'm not gonna try. It's truly one of the greatest movies ever. It has EVERYTHING! Never a dull moment.",positive
"Honestly, I'll never know what all the fuss is about.",negative
"It's one of the 3 or 4 best American films ever made but I had never seen it projected and with an audience until tonight. It was really interesting how seeing in with a big group of people changed the dynamic of the film for me, most notably bringing out a lot more humor than I had felt before. Some of the laughs come from the crowd being familiar with the material (when Kay asks Michael how his father helped Johnny Fontaine's singing career we laughed because we know the ""signature or brains"" story is coming next) but I swear Clameza is a comedic revelation now. ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" is gold with an audience! Between screening both Godfather I and II I was at the New Bev for over 7 hours tonight. Many thanks to their staff for staying up so late for us!",positive
A classic! It is Divine and gigantic also.,positive
"The Godfather begins as Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the head of a Mafia family, prepares to go to his daughter's wedding. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, has just arrived home from the war, but in no way does he plan on getting involved in his father's business. But when the Don rejects an offer from another family to start a drug selling business in New York, things start to get violent for the Corleone family. The Don's old world values will soon conflict with the ways of the new world, and many struggles begin to come for the Corleone family. The Godfather is a near perfect movie, most everyone knows that, and it all starts with the cast. It is without a doubt one of the greatest casts in movie history, and that is a big reason to why this movie is so acclaimed. To start with is Marlon Brando who plays the part of The Godfather, Don Vito Corleone. From the very first scene in the film I could tell this was going to be fantastic performance, as the critics and Oscars said it was. It was a very believable performance, and I don't think anyone else could have played the part better. In my opinion it is his career performance. Next we have Al Pacino who gave a career defining performance. Playing the part of the young son Michael was a difficult role to play, but he acted to perfection in this film. Easily one of my favorite performances of his. Now I have never been a big fan of James Caan. It seems that after this movie he has played in a lot of silly, terrible movies. But seeing him deliver what is definitely his best performance in The Godfather, it was almost enough to make me a fan for life. Robert Duvall who has always been one of my favorite actors, was excellent as well. It may not have been his best performance, but it was still a great one. And along with that all the other supporting actors were great. However, being a movie as good as this one, there were still many other great things about The Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola did an absolute masterful job with the writing and the direction of this film, and I don't think that many people would argue that The Godfather is his masterpiece. Francis Ford Coppola changed the expectations, and the way people view movies when he mad this film. Not to mention the music was very good, along with the visuals. Overall, The Godfather is probably the greatest movie ever made. With perfect acting, and perfect direction this movie will be hard to beat, ever. There are many good movies that have been made before, but The Godfather truly is a great film.",positive
"Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema.",positive

"**** One of the greatest films of all time is this likable epic of a family who are in the mafia, but have the morals to not sell drugs.

"The Godfather. Let's repeat it again, The Godfather. Daringly grisly, but the greatest of storytelling. Coppola and Puzzo's depiction of the Corleone dynasty is long and at times slow, but that doesn't mean you won't be on the edge of your seat every ten minutes (FYI, someone is shot stabbed, or blown up every ten minutes). The tension slowly rises throughout, and it pays off every single time. The acting is superb, especially from Marlon Brando and Duvall. Scratch that, everyone in The Godfather is amazing. These guys are dealing with very mature and held back roles where they have to display complex emotion (did I mention this is where several of them got their big break?). One of the greatest achievements of the film is its underlying simplicity, it's the story of one man and his inability to escape the corruption of his father and family's past. Michael begins as the man avoiding all family business, and ends up even worse than Vito. The Godfather shows the power of corruption, or better yet, the corruption of power. Even 'reasonable men' like Vito are responsible for horrible acts of cruelty. The Godfather defines the act of hitting the New York crime scene nail on its finely dressed but blood-covered head.",positive
"The Godfather. A monumental achievement in film history. A perfect piece of film art centered around the Sicilian crime ring. The characters were brought to life by the incredible performances from Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and the surreal achievement of Marlon Brando. The score was memorable and very well done. The writing created vividly real characters and conflicts, and the thrill of the films thrilling plot keeps its audience intrigued, and has kept us intrigued til this very day. A landmark for cinema.",positive
These kind of movies can only be made once in a lifetime. Superb performances......I consider it as #1 movie of all time.,positive

When watched in conjunction with Godfather Part II you see one of the greatest moral tales ever told on the silver screen. The story of Michael Corleone from good son to a man who will commit fraticide shows just how corrupted by the sin that lies inside every human being we are.,positive

Best film ever made? This film actually isn't overrated just fucking epic!,positive
"One of the best films ever made, hands down.",positive
"Boasting the greatest acting ever on film, the greatest actors on film, and one of the greatest directors of all time, this movie speaks for itself. The truly mesmerizing beginning chapter to the trilogy of the Corleone crime family's rise to power and family interactions is brutal as it is beautiful. Heart-breaking at times, it's more than words can possibly describe, an experience that no moviegoer could ever forget. Al Pacino's star-making role as the soon-to-be patriarch of the family is pitch-perfect, as well as a supporting cast of a who's-who of Hollywood legends (cough, cough, Marlon Brando,)the film is truly wonderful.",positive
"Simply Incredible! When the consensus says that The Godfather is the best movie of all time, while there may still be a debate, they have so much evidence to support that claim that the debate would seem rather unfair. The Godfather is simply INCREDIBLE. It has so much passion, depth, intensity, and intrigue that it blows current movies out of the water without even trying. Marlon Brando is so captivating as the head of the Corleone family and Al Pacino is an extremely believable Michael, the son who must take control over the family's operations. The only slight glitch, if you would, is that Michael is not an extremely expressive character and therefore Al Pacino's performance, however magnificent it is, is not that great of an achievement because not as much acting was needed as usual for a character of Michael's grandeur.",positive

"25 Movies that Changed the World - in Alphabetical order... 10. The Godfather What did it do? It took a much beloved novel, a star that was on the way out and a young Al Pacino to make arguably one of the best films of all time. It showed the other side to the underworld - the family side, and made people sit up and realise that although the mafia may be untouchable by the law and rampant with crime, they were also people with problems and feelings. You rooted for them, but they were essentially bad guys. What did it change? The careers of everyone involved. It gave birth to a whole legion of movies depicting organized crime. Two sequels, which like the first, were all Oscar winners.",positive

I finally got around to buying The Godfather restoration box set and have now finally watched The Godfather. This film was amazing. It definitely did not disappoint, and is truly a masterpiece. Francis Ford Coppola showed tremendous filmmaking genius with this Best Picture winning film that is considered by most to be one of the top three films ever made, and is the quintessential gangster/crime drama movie. Everyone in this film is fantastic. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, all gave amazing performances. And just about every scene of this film is infamous and well known by film lovers everywhere. This film's legacy, and the legacy of the trilogy as a whole, speak for themselves.

Direction by Francis Ford Coppola is sheer class & performances from its cast, perfect.

"""I Believe In America"" Then It All Begins. The Godfather in my eyes is the greatest motion picture of all time. The first time I seen this it was my favourite and it has never not been the best in my opinion. The casting is absolutely perfect, Marlon Brando gives one of his best or maybe even his best performance of all time as The Godfather Vito Corleone. Al Pacino plays the part of Michael excellant aswell, I think Part II is the one where he steals the show but nevertheless this performance but him on the road to stardom. The plot is very realistic and based on the real life five families and tries to show you have mafia families operate with different levels of authority and respect which had never been done before, Well at least I don't think. The Godfather will always be remembered and will always be on the top 100 of all time lists, Always in the top 5 and that is for a reason. Everything is perfect and there aren't very many films you can say that about: The characters, dialogue, the score, screenplay. Amazing!",positive
"""An offer you can't refuse."" I liked the concept and the theme very much. However, I guess it's just too long which made it hard to endure until the end. I also think that it somehow lacked action, which I expected a lot knowing that it's a gangster film. Still, in terms of technicalities and presentation, The Godfather is absolutely over the top. The last scenes were outstanding. To see The Godfather is surely an offer nobody can refuse.",positive
"Powerful performances, excellent characters, beautiful filmmaking, there's a reason why The Godfather is as well regarded as it is. It is a crime drama, but it's much more than that. It's a chronicle of this family's rule in the mafia. The roads it takes with its characters, particularly Michael Corleone (played brilliantly by Al Pacino), and the way the story progresses really engages you, and for a 3 hour long movie, nothing feels forced, nothing feels like it needs to be removed.

"There has been a lot of talk around about this time of overrated acclaimed films. And I do have my fair share and it is a very little list but what makes my number 1 of all time is the greatest film itself. I'm not much of a fan of video games but right now I prefer playing than watching it. I am only going to keep it short but it's all only due to the fact its high rating and all these people who simply call this ""Perfect"". But the problem is the films disjointed plot and the fact is some scenes and parts really don't move at all...that can really bore the shit out of me. And in all respect the lack in emotional impact...And by far the characters are uninteresting. Before i finish ""Once Upon A Time in America"" is better with its long and gripping story and interesting characters. I gave this a 20% the first time I viewed it and the film sits on a 40-50% right now because I watched it again but I really just couldn't keep my eyes open.",negative
"After seeing this, I think to myself ""wow, now I know why they call this the greatest film of all time"". James Caan and Robert Duvall both deserve the Oscars they were nominated for, but more notably, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. I still wonder how good the second installment is, due to the fact that I haven't seen it yet. This is the absolute PERFECT movie, with performances so very well done, and it's also a cool fact that nobody in the world dislikes this movie. 11 Oscars nominations total, including Best Picture.",positive
Absolutely Fantastic!,positive
"Okay, I will admit I am only 13 and have seen this film only once. Im sure I will love it when I am older. It had a good plot but It did get a bit confusing(im young) thats why I gave it a sixty percent.",negative

One of the best mob movies! The classic mob movie that started it all.,positive
"I have been hearing about how amazing this movie is since I was very little. Therefore, I was obviously interested in seeing it, and I finally succeeded about a month ago. I would have to say that the best part about this movie is how realistic it is. This movie perfectly displays the insecurity of a stereotypical mob family and their suspicion that everyone is willing to stab them in the back. I also love how the Godfather portrayed the mob's emphasis on family, both blood relations and other, because not only is it a well known aspect of actual mobs it also added to the storyline. For example, the wedding scene when one of the men disrespected the family because of his absence. It seemed so fitting to the beginning of a mob movie. Most importantly, I loved the cast. The acting was amazing and completely believable. The leader of the family has this ability to be the loving father and yet the ruthless leader willing to do anything to protect what is his. Also, Michael and the calculating personality he develops as his life becomes more and more intertwined with his father's is the perfect demonstration of how power can change people. Personally, this movie is definitely on my top ten.",positive

"40 years ago ""The Godfather"" was released, a film that is routinely listed as one of the greatest films ever made and more often than not on those list it's ranked at the number one spot. And for damn good reason. It remains the ultimate morality tale that not only represents a turning point in cinema, but in American culture and consciousness as well. Director Francis Ford Coppola crafted a saga that defined themes of possibility and disappointment in America and reached Shakespearean levels of national self-identity within it's characters. And there is nothing unforgettable in it. Lines are recited on what seems like a daily basis, from iconic quotes (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") to the more obscure (""What, trigger too tight?""). The gorgeous sunset pallet by cinematographer Gordon Willis is only rivaled by Nino Rita's sweeping and romantic score. Marlon Brando's Oscar winning and immortalizing performance as Vito Corleone is only matched by the star-making performances by Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan as his rising crime offspring. Without ""The Godfather"" there may not be a ""Goodfellas"" or a ""Casino"", there certainly wouldn't be a heavily influenced show such as ""The Sorpranos"" or all the many spoofs, and of course there wouldn't be the near equal sequel ""The Godfather Part ll"" or it's flawed but nonetheless rousing finale ""The Godfather Part lll"".",positive
Watched it again today. Still awesome movie after 38 years....outstanding.,positive
"One of the greatest films ever made and the best work by Francis Ford Coppola, this movie looks even better on blu-ray. There are superb performances all around especially by Brando, Pacino, Caan, & Duvall. Even the little things like the intentional changing of the color of the film creates a great look and mood. The score is fairly simple yet adds the right amount of music for any given scene. It stands as one of the best movies ever made and still lives up to it to this day. If you haven't seen the Godfather yet then now is the time.",positive
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.,positive
"I have not seen that many gangster films, but I could not ask for a more perfect standard to hold the genre to than Francis Ford Coppola's epic about a ""family business."" I watched this movie in my first movie analysis class, which taught me the the skill of seeing things in a movie beyond the obvious and the beauty of constructive criticism. Even in the town that had lost its principal business when I was going to high school there, there were people who cared about their education and diversifying their taste in movies, expanding their cultural knowledge whether they left town after graduating or not. And that is why this is one of the most important films I have ever seen. Even though many people will probably see the parodies of the scenes in this movie before the actual movie, a key part of understanding any cultural reference is knowing where it originated. I was well aware of the tollbooth massacre, horse head in bed, and the cluster of assassinations that occurred exactly the same time as Michael's acceptance into the church before seeing this movie, but seeing the original version is still something any true movie fan should experience in their life, as they contribute to the film's general significance. The Godfather is one of the most important films one may ever watch in life. Without this movie, we would not have Martin Scorcese's Goodfellas or Brian De Palma's Scarface advancing the genre, but Coppola is the one that perfected the genre with The Godfather. Even if you don't like it as much as everyone says, at least you'll be able to understand all those references on The Simpsons (which most often occur with the stories involving resident Springfield mobster Fat Tony).",positive

"This is a movie that needs no introduction. Coppola's masterpiece, the gangster movie to end all gangster movies. Could this movie ever live up to the hype? I approached this movie skeptically. Three and a half hours is nothing to scoff at, and I'm not known for my patience. Yet this movie was everything it promised to be, and more. This movie follows the epic struggles between Mafia families and the internal tensions within the Corleone organization. The focal point is Michael Corleone, the youngest son, the ""civilian"" of his family, who soon shows himself quite capable of helping out the family. The film moves on the strength of its characters. The casting is excellent for the most part. Marlon Brando is magnificent as Vito Corleone, the Don of the family. He plays his character with great grace, managing to capture Vito's sharp intuition as well as his strong sense of honor. At one point Vito is given the news of a death in the family. His face contorts, he shakes with grief, and he turns away. When he turns back, he is composed, the Don again and no longer just a father. It's moments like these that distinguish The Godfather from other gangster films: the gangsters are not mindless thugs, but real people. All actions in this world have motivations, whether those motivations are revenge, greed, or love. No figure in this film better exemplifies this than Michael, the anti-hero and protagonist played by Al Pacino. Michael acts meticulously to protect his family members, seemingly without remorse. This is a bloody tale of revenge and love in the best sense. When the movie climbs to its bloody climax, your breath catches in your throat, and as the actors come tumbling down, you can't help but exult and be horrified in Michael's victory. 5/5 Waffles",positive

Its struggles with Pulp Fiction and Taxi Driver for my number 1 spot is a hard one, but for the moment it is winning, though this changes a lot, but it is always between those three films. Anyway, The Godfather is a majestic drama. It is a gangster film, the gangster film. There won't be any better (yep, not even Pulp Fiction). It is perfect in every aspect, it does nothing wrong, absolutely nothing. There is no other film this powerful, of this caliber. I can watch it over and over again for a thousand years and I will never get tired of its excellent story, incredible performances, flawless direction, perfect script and of course its wonderful music. This film's magic is attributed to Francis Ford Coppola (director and writer), Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, Talia Shire (all actors), Mario Puzo (novel and writer), and Nino Rotta (music), along with others.

"""The Godfather"" moves at such a relaxed pace, and that maybe why it is highly regarded as a masterpiece. Despite those relaxed scenes, there are some explosive scenes within. Several shootouts occur and there is a lot of bloodshed throughout the film. There are also some scenes of utter shock and despair. Marlon Brando moves from intense, explosive acting in his 1950's hits ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""On the Waterfront"" to a very sedate, unbelievable beautiful role. Al Pacino is fine as a good guy turned evil and the supporting cast. Diana Keaton strikes particular interest to me, since she is simply innocent, drowned into the Mafia world. A character like her in this film is needed. Also, Sterling Hayden is also of particular interest since he seems to portray both hero and villain his films (previous films I have seen with him were ""The Asphalt Jungle"" where he was involved in a robbery and ""Johnny Guitar"" where he is hero for Joan Crawford). Wonderful film, and absolute must-see for ALL movie buffs, especial since there are so many scenes that are unbelievably memorable and influential. Also, very good dialogue and beautiful cinematography.",positive

"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" sustains its status as a masterpiece. Before I give reasons for its greatness I would like to notify some of the issues it has that deprives it from reaching absolute perfection. The events that take place from Luca Brasi meeting Virgil Sollozzo to the attempt on Vito Corleone's life were slightly out of tune; I've seen it now several times, these events happen very fast. They needed to be developed more. Michael's brief part with the nurse, Kay meeting with Tom Hagen after Michael has gone to Italy are two other particular sequences I felt were not executed as good; in the latter the conversations taking place between the two just seems awkward, it feels like a scene that needs to be edited out, but just put in place to give the audience some assurance that Kay is asking about Michael's whereabouts. The complaints I mentioned above are not as important, but I felt they needed to be said. On a more important note: I think the film does a disservice to the mother, we see Santino and Vito mention her throughout, but she is never given a real role. It's as if when they mention mother, it is really a synonym for their own selves. As great as the ""The Godfather"" is, it would have been even greater if the mother had a larger role: it would have a quadruple effect on Michael's relationship with the women; his sister, his first wife, Kay, and the mother. Maybe I am being unfair, the film is three hours long, it's quite possible Coppola just did not have enough time to incorporate everything, and I have no idea if the mother has a larger role in the novel. It did bother me that she is left as a statue even at the funeral. The opening of the film is magnificent and so is the wedding, which is really a base for introducing the audience to the majority of the characters: we learn the mischief of Sonny, the clumsiness of Fredo, and the calm and serious nature of Michael. Marlon Brando as The Godfather is an omniscient (God) being, he seems to know everything; him looking at Michael through the window, or when Santino comes in the office, Brando mentions that someone who does not spend time with his family can never be a real man while looking back at Santino. I feel Al Pacino's performance is just as great as Marlon Brando's. Brando's greatness is outward, it can be seen; his voice, the way he moves, his incredible dialogue delivery. Pacino's is inward; it can only be detected through the eyes; fire and coldness consist in them. I don't mean Brando's performance does not have depth; both are brilliant. The sequence involving the gun attached to the toilet tells us that Al Pacino has arrived. I also loved Al Lettieri's performance as Sollozzo, I loved everything about him; when he is with Hagen the use of light to even give more attention to his big eyes and big lips is astonishing, and what an incredible voice! Very much like its masterful opening, ""The Godfather"" ends in great consecutive undertakings: the baptism, the revelation of the two traitors (one of them seems as if he is going on a car ride to a different world while the music plays), and the closing of the door reminiscent of John Ford's ""The Searchers."" We come to realize that it is not Michael renouncing Satan, but Satan renouncing everybody else. When in Italy, one of Michael's bodyguard mentions that Appollonia will even tempt the devil; that she did.",positive

"A long slow burner but its all worth it in the end. The Godfather is an absolute classic which some critics and directors believe to be the greatest film ever made. Sure its great and up there, but I wouldn't say it was the best. The story focuses on a gangster family organization called the Corleones. The head of the family Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) more commonly known as The Godfather, offers his assistance to people who come to him asking for a favor when in trouble. Don Vito makes an oath with them in which he solves their problems but they must pay back the favor in return someday. Along with the Corleones there are other rival families along with crooked cops. As a result of this rivalry they attempt to assassinate Don Vito but fail. This is when the three sons of the Corleone family Sonny, Michael, and Fredo step up to resolve the problems with the people who tried to kill their father and with each other as a family. With a cast containing the likes of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall; the Godafather doesn't disappoint as far as performances go. With plenty of drama, violence, and rivalry The Godfather is in tree terms a grand solid oak of a film.",positive

"Okay, now, let me tell you right now that you probably shouldn't watch this film's trailer if you're that one chump who hasn't seen this film yet, because it's nearly four minutes of hardcore spoilers. Well, if you're that one chump who isn't interested in seeing this film, maybe you should watch the trailer for the summary, because it let's you know everything you can expect out of this film, even down to being overlong and a little dull. ...I just said that to mess with people, because, yeah, this film is awesome, it's just that I'm not sure about it being the best American film ever. Now, as far as being the best Italian-American film, if it isn't that, then it is the definitive Italian-American film, despite being titled ""The Godfather"", rather than ""The Gawdfawdda"". By the time this film came out, Marlon Brando already had more than enough of his own kids, and enough of them ended up well-versed in killing people for the sake of loved ones, so I wouldn't trust him as the godfather for my kids, and it... apparently doesn't help that he's not really of Italian descent. No matter how much cotton was stuffed into Brando's mouth, people kept complaining about him being in this role, and I can kind of understand, because later on in 1972, he betrayed the Italians by tangoing in Paris, and already has no Italian blood, as anyone should know after this film, which shows us plenty of Italian blood. Nitpick all you want, you New York clichés, this film is killer, even though there are issues extending beyond nitpicks. Really, I am sort of nitpicking by criticizing the disconcerting aspects of this heavy drama, for they are not great issues, but the impact of this drama really is shaken up a bit by certain disturbances that, while respectably audacious and thoroughly effective, are occasionally gratuitous in their extreme brutality (Poor horsy), particularly when reflective of the brutality of components in a character roster that is all but comprised of problematic roles with unlikable traits, some of which are too challenging to completely accept, in spite of all of the extensively humanized writing and enthralling performances. If nothing else, the characters are hard to juggle, for there are many layers to this dramatic epic, all of which are so compelling that I can't really see expending them, even though they beget a focal unevenness that derives from there being too many narrative branches to explore with perfect balance, and is not helped by the very segmented structure of the affair that spans the progression of the individual layers with too much extensiveness, quickly incorporating and dismissing important characters and other aspects in a sometimes awkward manner. If it's not merely disconcerting in its unevenness, the narrative excessiveness begets a convolution that makes revisiting the film kind of fun in its driving you to gradually piece together and interpret the plot, but aggravates a bit, for it demands so much of your attention so often, which would be fine if the film wasn't so blasted long. There's something rather intimate about this drama, so if nothing else allows the final product to qualify as an epic, it's a runtime of almost three hours, achieved through all of the excessive plot layering that I just mentioned, and through a near-monotonously overt attention to detail that occasionally devolves into a meditation on a whole lot of nothing. The film is so engrossing throughout its course, but it's so blasted overlong, and there's no disregarding that, for the pacing is all but stiffened by a defining meditativeness to storytelling that is realized enough to cut deep into those with the patience to embrace this important film for all its worth, but pretty dry, retarding a sense of momentum and often being something that a film this incredibly crafted cannot afford to be if it wishes to go well beyond standing out as a whole. Yes, people, the film is, in fact, dull, at least at times, but those times are recurrent enough for the final product to gradually lose momentum, with the help of the over-thickening of the plot that helps in making the runtime wear down on you, until the epic, never less than outstanding, secures itself as something of a challenge to one's patience. I do not find the film to be, on a general standard, the bona fide masterpiece that it is widely embraced as, but there's simply no denying the excellence of this triumph in dramatic filmmaking, and although the film is not to be taken lightly in any way, it is at least a borderline masterpiece that succeeds pretty remarkably on most levels, such as aesthetic ones. Near-meditative in its utilizing a quietness throughout its three-hour course, the film very rarely uses a soundtrack, but when it does, Nino Rota's score work, accompanied by some additional music by Carmine Coppola is not simply worth waiting for, but just about amazing, with a unique, almost whimsical Italian flavor whose minimalism is hauntingly beautiful in its graceful subtlety, and in its complimenting the capturing of the drama's subtle intensity and importance, from a musical standpoint. From a visual standpoint, Warren Clymer's outstanding art direction further engrosses, convincingly restoring the distinctive looks of New York, Sicily and a few other locations during the 1940s and 1950s, but not emphasizing the time periods like many other period epics, being less interested in immersing you into the film's setting, and more interested in immersing you into the film's environment, molding lavishly intricate and richly dynamic sets so distinguished that they are stunning. Really, it might not so much be the visuals that are so handsome, as much as its the visuals' presentation, through cinematography by Gordon Willis that was groundbreaking in its rugged bleakness, with portraitist coloration and spare lighting that is consistently handsome, and sometimes awe-inspiring when combined with the lavish art direction in the context of iconically lyrical visuals. Each aesthetic attribute of this film is subtle, but so richly inspired that it makes the final product, if nothing else, a masterpiece of haunting musicality and memorable visual artistry so realized in its distinguished taste that it is not simply a component in beautiful cinematic artistry, but a component in selling the importance of this dramatic epic's subject matter. Mario Puzo's novel of the same name may be a little too layered to bring to cinematic storytelling sensibilities all that easily, but all of the excess reflects a scope in subject matter so epic that it makes up for a lack of scale, or is at least justified by each story's being of tremendous importance, in its deeply intricate realism as a portrait on the mafia, made all the more intriguing by plot aspects that are filled to the brim with dramatic weight. Focusing on an old man's finally being threatened by a comeuppance for his life of crime, on a young man's submission of his life and everything he loves to crime, on an abusive man who is threatened by and threatens the criminal family he marries into, and everything in between, Puzo's story is overwhelming in its depth, importance and potential, and although this film is not the stellar masterpiece that it could have been, at least to me, it is absolutely outstanding. The aforementioned style reflects, not corruptible ambition, but the inspiration that could drive this drama a long, long way if it was applied to substance, even on paper. Mario Puzo joins Francis Ford Coppola in bringing his vision to life, through a script that helps in holding your attention throughout a challenging plot and runtime, backed by a challenging pace, with a sharp wit, particularly in near-consistently quotable dialogue whose range reflects the sophistication and intensity of the subject matter, further defined by a meticulous, if sometimes excessive portrayal of mafia workings that is fascinatingly believable and captivatingly extensive, but not played over real dramatic nuance. The script might not be able to flow between its layers all that smoothly, for there are so many of them with so many layers, but the fact of the matter is that the storytelling takes the time to flesh itself out from every angle, and considering that this epic is so intimate, that means that each character, not matter how morally misguided, is distinguished with diversity and nuance that endears you to most every role, with a great deal of help from strong acting found, well, almost all across the board. As a spoiled young woman trapped in an abusive relationship that could lead to the demise of very important loved ones, Talia Shire, Coppola's sister (Can anyone in his family act?), has a lot on her plate, and she's too hammy and too dramatically thin to really convince, but you quickly forget about her, for this is a sprawling cast that is otherwise comprised of memorable performances that, whether charismatic or show-stealingly emotional, compel, with standouts including James Caan as a spirited, but hot-headed man seeking what's best for his family, and Gianni Russo as an abusive man of too much power. Of course, there are two people in this film who really steal the show, with Marlon Brando, even with the excellent makeup effects and cotton-filled mouth taken out of account, becoming the Vito Corleone character, complete with a presence of great respectability and authority, broken by some shocking evidence of vulnerability that Brando anchors through emotional effectiveness, while Al Pacino utilizes an almost sweeping dramatic range which captures a gradual transformation in the Michael Corleone character, from a good-hearted young man who questions his family's criminal affairs, to a strong and dangerous figure capable of carrying the criminal affairs, that is as captivating an arc as any in this epic. In a notably brilliant sequence in which Michael prepares to commit his first murder, background noise drowns out chatter and the camera focuses on Pacino's face as his character contemplates the repercussions of fully submitting his life to the mob by taking lives, and in a matter of seconds, Pacino defines why this film made him a megastar with a hypnotic expressiveness that not only marks the beginning of Corleone's transformation which will be one of the most vital arteries in the heart of the drama from then on, but encompasses the subtle power on which this drama thrives, as a triumph in artistry, writing and acting which simply wouldn't be if the aforementioned stellar aspects weren't orchestrated with such realization by triumphant direction. Meticulous and thoughtful, Coppola's direction is rather bland, if not a touch dull in its steady pacing, which tries a patience that is firmly secured by Coppola's strengths, of which there are so many its almost astounding, with scene structuring being so tight and subtly sophisticated that it holds up some spark of entertainment value, while a realized orchestration of edgy, if occasionally overly disturbing visuals, and of anything from stunning style to gripping performances, all backed by the graceful subtlety, sustains consistent intrigue through all of the relatively limp spots, until the plot thickens with anything from gut-wrenching tension, to devastating resonance. It's difficult to fully describe what exactly Coppola does in his revelatory directorial performance, but that sort of sophisticated subtlety is exactly what makes the storytelling of this film so magical, because even though there are shortcomings in this film, aesthetically, technically and dramatically, this epic is so brilliantly, maybe even masterfully crafted that the final product never loses so much momentum as to descend from an absolutely outstanding state. It's difficult to deny that one's investment is tried by some overt disturbances and moral ambiguities, while patience is tried by the unevenness and episodicity of a convolutedly overblown story, told with such excessiveness, and at such a ponderous pace, that the final product's momentum finds itself gradually dying down, but aesthetic brilliance deriving from haunting score work, engrossing art direction and masterfully stunning cinematography helps in holding one's attention, while an outstanding story of enthralling realism, rich dramatic layers, and depth is done enough justice by razor-sharp and extensive scripting, powerful performances, - the most outstanding of which being courtesy of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino - and deeply realized direction to render Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" as an outstanding crime epic, and as an indisputable triumph in cinematic artistry and dramatic brilliance. 3.75/5 - Upstanding",positive

"It's been a very long time since I last saw this, so I had to check it out again. Well, it's still an incredible movie and at nearly 3 hours long is extremely entertaining. Everyone and everything in the film is top notch, though this time around I noticed the supporting actors a lot more, particularly Castellano and Duvall who were excellent. And man, I guess watching it again I didn't realize Brando wasn't in the film that much, but he has such a commanding presence whenever he's on screen that it just felt like a lead role. I've only seen Part II and Part III once before, and that was many years ago, I need to check those out again.",positive
This is the real deal. These other gangster movies are imposters! Classic!,positive
Coppola's finest work. One of my top 3 favorites,positive
"This is not my favorite movie of all time but it's definitely great. I'm putting it down half a star from my original 5 stars because it is a bit overrated, but still awesome. It's still a worthy Oscar winner. It's just not the best ever like society says so. I'll try not to go with crowd hype too much from now on.",positive
"For many years I tried to avoid seeing The Godfather because mafia films are one of my less favorite movie genres. Besides, I dreaded watching Marlon Brando talking through his tampons for almost three hours. Now that I've seen it, I understand why people call it a masterpiece. The combination of crime and family life, New York and Corleone in Sicily is just right. The tragic fall of the old don and the rise of the new one, as well as the fight of the hot headed sons against the other influential criminal families is well depicted.",positive
"You come to me and ask for my help, but you don't ask with respect. You don't bother to call me ""Godfather"". I have seen this movie at least dozen of times, but I like it even more every time I watch it. Coppola, Brando, Pacino, Duvall and Caan at their best.",positive
"I've just watched this overrated rubbish. It really is a poor excuse for a gangster movie. It seemed like a 90 minute film being stretched over three hours. A three hour film is fine if it needs to be that long, this didn't. 10% Tomato rating from me.",negative
take a pulp novel written quickly (and quite poorly) add a young adventurous director and a superb young cast and movie magic is made as Coppolla's 1972 epic transformed cinema as we knew it. Not just the best gangster film ever made but one of the best movies period. Brando ain't bad either,positive
"Not honouring this film as one of the greatest cinematic achievements in film history, would be an insult to the Coppola family, and everyone involved in making such a triumphant masterpiece. As Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in the stages of his life, where his title can be swept away at ay moment, we are taken deep into the mafia wars between the Corleone family and the families (just like any mafia war) who want them dead. This film is a transition, as Mike Corleone (Al Pacino) is to take the place of his father (as ""the Godfather"") in the family business. Everything about this film screams brilliance. The writing is magnificent, the acting is tremendously impressive, the story is one of the best ever told, and the directing, along with the editing and cinematography is fantastic, even though it may seem basic. ""The Godfather"" is a film that I will always remember, and be able to watch over and over again until my dying day.",positive
"Arguably, the greatest film. Coppola's masterpiece has triumphantly told the essence of both crime and family to one another, and that's what makes The Godfather exceptional from other gangster films. Brando leads, arguably, the best cast ensemble ever put together. He is the very heart of the story. Pacino is surely terrific as Michael, who takes over as the head of the family, in one of the best endings ever.",positive
The perfect cinematic story.,positive
"It's not that I didn't like this movie, I just didn't understand what was going on. It was hard to hear what they were saying (especially Marlon Brando) and it was quite complicated. I had to read the wikipedia summary three times in order to follow the story. I suppose the main reason I didn't like it was the lack of attractive characters. Sure they were all brilliantly acted out (great script and everything.) But none of them are likable as people. Kudos to Al Pacino and Marlon. Great job.",negative
"not much i can say about this one, i mean, it IS The Godfather, gotta get back to running a business after i get done killing, or is killing THE business? think about it",positive
"One of the greatest movies ever made. Great cast, script, direction, cinematography. What else can you say.",positive
How can you not like this?,positive
The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece.,positive
"A perfect movie. Many say Citizen Kane is the greatest film but I would have to disagree with them, The Godfather is a far superior film. The violence in The Godfather balances out the film by showing the character's concidences of being part of the mafia instead of it just to entertain the audience. There are very few 3 hour movies that at one point I wasn't bored of watching, and this film is one of them. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, not knowing when other character is going to be killed off. I love Michael Corleone's character arc, at the beginning, he wanted nothing to do with the family business but by end of the film when he becomes the head of it family, he becomes just like his father. The story, the acting, the cinematography, the lighting, the editing, everything is top notch. In my eyes anyways, there haven't been a film that surpassed The Godfather in all of these categories.",positive
"The Godfather..there are no words 2 describe how amazing this movie is. However, I do think that Marlon Brando's performance was extremely overrated & at some times a little silly. Al Pacino was the real star in this movie. Brando did better in ""On the Waterfront,"" ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" & ""Apocalypse Now.""",positive
A fabulous tale that must be seen.,positive
how can the greatest movie of all time also be the most boring movie of all time. I have know idea but it is.,positive
now this movie cant b rated so is al pacino,positive
best movie of all time,positive
Best movie ever.......,positive
"""I'm going to give him an offer he can't refuse."" This line is probably one of the most famous lines in film history, while the film itself is also famous and so well-known. This is probably the hallmark of all mafia films, with its epic focus and great detail of the life and style of the 1940s and the mafia. Francis Ford Coppola not only directed, but also co-wrote the script with Mario Puzo, who also wrote the book that the film is based on. The film focuses on Don Corleone, the leader of the mafia, as well as Michael Corleone, the Don's youngest son, who later becomes heir to the empire. The film's cinematography gives it a really old feel to it, while the violence is absolutely realistic to the times. Many of the actors all do a good job, including Marlon Brando as Don Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams and James Caan as Sonny Corleone. An epic in its own way, this film is also followed by an amazing sequel.",positive

If you're a film major and have not seen the Godfather. Shame on you,positive
"I watched bits of this with my dad once....definetly a ""blokey film""",negative
It insists upon itself.,positive
"The Coppola restoration makes the audience an offer they can't refuse; the film has been restored wonderfully. This epic story shows the gripping lifestyle of the mafia and how easily one can be sucked into it's grasp. Marlon Brando gives an excellent performance, but it's the cold gaze of Al Pacino that takes over the film. The DVD does a great job of cleaning up the older film grain, but still isn't perfect. I suppose that adds to the it's ""flavor"", but I suppose this is as good as it gets; which is really well done so don't get me wrong. The performances are all very well acted that's a given, but the weakness of the film is the low audio levels. I get tired of having to turn my tv up so loudly to hear the whispering dialogue. The film is known to be a masterpiece. I can't refute that, the film is honest and excellent. The ending is as powerful as the substance.",positive
it could benefit from being a bit shorter. i mean we get it... it's a man's world. great acting though,positive
"This movie got everything right. It has the best cinematography, best writing, best acting, best directing, and it's a game changer. Everything is perfect. And I wish to see Coppola make another movie as great as this.",positive
"The best film ever made. Cleanly edited, finely acted, perfectly directed and superbly written. Pacino shines memorably.",positive
"¨I`ll make him an offer he can`t refuse.¨ Many people consider the 70`s to be the Golden Age in Cinema, and if that is the case then Francis Ford Coppola had a great deal to do with it. During that decade he directed The Godfather Part 1 and 2, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now; he also produced American Graffiti, and wrote the screenplay for Patton. During that time he won 5 Oscars and was nominated for another seven. At least one of these films is on everybody`s favorite movies list, and The Godfather is considered by many critics to be the best film of all time. Despite being nominated for eleven Oscars it only took home three (Best Picture, Best Performance by Marlon Brando, and Best Screenplay), just one more confirmation that a film can`t be judged by the amount of awards it receives. The Godfather deserves much more. It is a movie that has transcended time and is enjoyed by everyone even decades after its first release. It was the first of its kind to portray the mafia from the inside and Coppola does a great job at romanticizing them and making us root for these criminals. How does he do it? By showing us the mafia as a strong and united family that supports each other; portraying the good guys as bad (there are corrupt cops and politicians); and making Vito Corleone stand out from the rest of the criminal families by not wanting to get involved in the drug business. He completely romanticizes the Corleone family and has us rooting for them from the very first scene thanks to a very intelligent script co-written with Mario Puzo who had previously written the bestselling novel. The script is amazing, the performances are great, and the direction from Coppola is just superb. All these elements combine perfectly to create this classic masterpiece. We are introduced to Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in the opening scene. He is head of one of the five New York Mafia families, and is attending his daughter`s wedding. The wedding serves as a great excuse for Coppola to introduce all the characters because the entire family is gathered at the wedding. Vito is the Godfather for many of the people invited and he is treated with a great deal of respect. Tradition has it that no Sicilian can refuse requests on their daughter`s wedding day, so Vito is attending some of his associates who are in need of favors. His sons Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale) are in the family business along with Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the family lawyer and consigliere, who was adopted by Vito at a very young age and is like a son to him as well. His youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), a World War II veteran shows up with his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) and is talking to her about his family. This conversation also serves as a perfect excuse to hear anecdotes about the family`s criminal life and we are informed at once that Michael is the only one who is not involved in the family business. He has decided to stay away from the criminal lifestyle and is respected by his family. The entire plot takes place inside the world of the Corleone family and during a time where significant change begins to take place. Vito will have to make an important decision whether or not the family should protect a wealthy man named The Turk (Al Lettieri) who is trying to bring heroin into the city, or stick to the harmless gambling and alcohol business. He better think things carefully because his decision could have consequences. The Godfather is without a doubt a masterpiece and the cast has a great deal to do with it. James Caan and Robert Duvall had worked with Coppola in his previous film, The Rain People, and now they returned again with significant roles. They give great performances, but who really stands out in this movie is Marlon Brando who really becomes the Don. He gives one of the most memorable and all-time best movie performances in film history. Al Pacino hadn`t made a significant movie before and the transformation he goes through in this film is incredible. His character is the one who experiences the most change if we recall his first appearance in the wedding and his last one in the Baptism scene. The screenplay is also very well written, the story completely hooks us from the very beginning, the characters are unforgettable, and Coppola just did a great job with the direction as he immersed us inside this world of crime. Of course we know that the mob world isn`t anything like this and it has been romanticized by Hollywood, but Coppola managed to make us care for these criminals who actually don`t see themselves as the villains. Nino Rota`s score is just amazing and breathtaking; it helps build the suspense.The Baptism parallel action scene is one of the best ones in film history and has since been imitated endlessly in most action films, although never with the same effect. This is required viewing for everyone, one of the greatest achievements in film history. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",positive

"Explaine what's in this movie should be impossible. talking of the technical things, probably is one of the best movies ever made. Amazing soundtracks (when I listen to the main soundtrack I always think of the gold medal in figure skating Pluschenko won in the Turin 2006 Winter Olimpyc Games), amazing plot, amazing acting from everybody. Cite only Marlon Brando and Al Pacino would be unfair with all the others actors, but they were perfect. Also in the american version they seemed so Sicilians (infact I didn't understadn anything), and I had to watch it in Italian! Then, as Italian I couldn't obviously not be ashamed of what this people made in America and are still making here in Italy. And it's for these reasons, when my friends try to explain to me the problems immigration is taking with it, I always remember them that the Italians create a lot of probem when they emigrated.",positive

Also the backstories of everyone are missing, which is especially sad when it come to Michael's new bodyguard in the end, and Luca Brasi, and of course the Don himself. Other than that, it's prolly the best movie based on a book I've ever seen. Small changes have been made, but nothing serious. All the major events are in it, all the big lines, etc. This is an amazing movie. If you have read the book, you will still love it. If you haven't, you'll seriously love it.",positive

I love that the first 25min is all at ""the day of my daughter's wedding"". And there's so many things in this film which are now common reference in pop culture - Brando's voice (which I had to use subtitles to understand!), the horse head in the bed, making an ""offer he can't refuse""... I particularly love the evolution of Pacino's character, who at the start you don't even recognise, because he looks so young & innocent, then by the end he more resembles his character from The Devil's Advocate! Great storytelling with plenty of great actors.",positive

original best of course. where it all got started.,positive
A masterpiece of cinema only exceeded by its sequel.,positive
"The Godfather is arguably the most popular American movie ever made. It sits second in the www.imdb.com top 250 and for a film approaching its 40th birthday, this is quite an achievement. I have seen the movie 3 times now and it is quite simply a masterpiece of film making and Francis Ford Coppola's crowning achievement. The movie tells the tale of the Corleone crime family. Marlon Brando stars as the charismatic, almost loveable Don Vito Corleone who controls the family. Brando won an Oscar for The Godfather and it's easy to see why he is one of the most celebrated talents in Hollywood's history. Playing a character twenty years older than himself, Brando is believable and completely absorbing as the Don who recognises friendship, family and loyalty above all else. James Caan and John Cazale also star as two of Vito's sons but it is Al Pacino who bursts onto the Hollywood radar as youngest born Michael Corleone. It's fascinating to see the transformation between the Mich",positive
"Masterpiece! ""Only don't tell me that you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and it makes me very angry""",positive
Greatest Of All Time,positive
"Have you heard about this film? The Godfather? Well if you haven't then you should wake up as it has been and always will be one of the most critically praised and influential films of all time. The notorious story of the Corleone crime family is a tragic, intelligent and suave depiction of the career and family life of Don Vito, an Oscar winning performance for Marlon Brando and arguably his best and Michael Corleone, Al Pacino in a lesser praised however equally outstanding performance as the Don's son. Though The Godfather has forever been a critically praised piece and always one to top any critic's best film list I have to admit that when I first witnessed the film I wasn't entirely impressed. However this was at an age when I didn't appreciate it for what it was worth. It was a three hour film with a hell of a lot of dialogue and not much excitement. It was hard for me to watch the film all the way through without getting lost and I was overall challenged by getting my head around it. However, three years later I have returned to the film and have realised that it is indeed wirth that spot on a critic's top ten film list.The performances from each actor are acceptional and incredably memorable (for example Caan, Duvall and Keaton's performances). The story, based on Mario Puzo's novel is a realistic, emotionial and graphic depiction of crime life and one of the best ever created. If I were to carry on praising this film for everything it deserves I would have run out of characters. It is incredably hard to write a review that gives The Godfather the justice it deserves and therefore I'll sum it up in one phrase. ""Bloody Spectacular.""",positive
"This is what a movie should be. Solid performances from the cast, engaging plot and dialog, and absolute minimal action.",positive
"Movies this good come along once, or twice, in a lifetime.",positive
everywhere i go or log in people say this film is the greatest film of all time well it is,positive
"(rating from memory, haven't seen it in years.)",positive
"CLASSIC! This movie is always the most talked about and rarely does anyone try and sale you on the story. I'm still waiting for ""someone"" to write a bad review so WE can stone him!",positive
you can make yourself an offer with the DVD that you simply cannot refuse buying.,positive
A classic mob story.,positive
awesome awesome film.,negative
The gold standard. Perfection. Flawless. This is how movies were ment to be.,positive
"The Godfather is the greatest film ever created. Everything about it is perfect the scipt, the acting, the cinematography, the sets, costumes, and of course the story. This is a film that must be seen by everyone. A bonafide classic.",positive
"10/10: The movie that starts the whole crime/mafia genre. Never watched this masterpiece until now, it ranks among the best there is.",positive
The best of the collection.,positive
"""Loved ones comes first"" is the main heart that's surrounded by the crime and violence in The Godfather. It's a really great film, but very, very slow.",positive
So great! Gotta love this film!,positive
A touching exiting gangster movie so well made and a fantastic plot.,positive
la mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos,positive
"This milestone in movie history is intelligent, insightful, entertaining, and so much more.",positive
"I just finished watching this for the First time ever, I know, I know. I am surprised at how much I enjoyed it, it was really well made & the 3+ hours went by quickly. It was also really interesting to see many of the actors at such a young age! I can see how this informed many, if not all, mob movies made after it.",positive
"Brilhante, o filme é uma aula de como se fazer cinema!",positive
This Movie Is Perfect.,positive
"Instant masterpiece. A huge milestone. The Godfather sits in its own category along side an amazing cast, a brilliant score, exceptional directing from Francis Coppola. This picture is a true vision of how story telling is to be done. Ladies and gentleman, this is called perfect. Francis Coppola has set the bar exceptionally high for a gangster film.",positive
The new restoration of the film supervised by Coppola himself looks WONDERFUL. It breathes new life into what was previously a dark and dull picture.,positive
"This is what you would call a perfect film. I has one of the greatest cast I have ever seen, the score is incredible, the pacing is great. I can not think of a single thing wrong with this film. From the opening line ""I believe in America"" it grabs you by the balls and refuses to let go. This is the greatest movie ever",positive
You need me to tell you to see this?,positive
"Classic - few movies can parallel the steady pace, understated tension, or brilliant imagery.",positive
Coppola classic. Brando great. Pacino become star!,positive
Gli faremo un'offerta che non potrÃ  rifiutare,positive
"This is not your typical gangster movie. Most people think of the raw action of Goodfellas and Casino when thinking of gangster flicks. This is a different breed, but it's no less hard hitting. The action and bloodshed is toned down somewhat throughout the nmovie to make way for a strong narrative, chronicling the breakdown and resurgence of one of the New York ""Five Families"". In the latter half of the film, things do get a little more violent, but this helps to move the story along to it's ultimate conclusion. This movie boasts excellent performances from all the players, in particular Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. If you haven't seen it yet, why not?",positive
Brilliant! The best classic ever!,positive
"If I tried to describe why I like this movie, I would insult the film. Just know that this is one of the greatest films of all time, if not the greatest.",positive
What can I say? Classic!,positive
"The best achievement of world cinema! Until I write this review, the echo of this film feels so great. In my heart there is still the name ""Michael Corleone"". Maybe it will never be erased. I'm not going to enter ""The Godfather"" in the list of my favorite movies, because this film had a separate list in my eyes!",positive
Melhor dos melhores...,positive
"finally i understand all the fusses was all about, believe it or not i just watched this movie a couple of days ago and i was not disappointed. i liked the fact it was old school gangster and not like those wanna be gangster the media portrays now adays. i was suprised with the awesomeness of this movie.watching it was like yes!!! he chocked that guy to death. yes! mafiah was shot five times and still alive. yes! boobies. yes! car explotion in tiny smetherene. yes!! they are making italian spaghetti meatballs. and then i passed out because of the awsomeness.",positive
it is simply the greatest American film of all time. i challenge anyone to make an argument to the contrary.,positive
I have nothing to say.,positive
"My advice to anyone who thinks they might or might not like it watch the film. Take it in. Watch the film, take even more in, then watch it again. I find my self surprised and moved every time I watch the film. I Want to come up to anyone in the movie business who indent doing to well and say; ""watch this, this is good!"" This is a great film that I am sure if you watch it you will proudly tell your friends about, and maybe show them. After seeing this I hope you will see the others as the brilliant three parted unfold the story perfectly.",positive
best movie for the all time...,positive
"If you don't like this movie, your not human!",positive
it doesn't get any better,positive
"Yes, I know, this is considered a masterpiece, but I've always found this film to be overrated. It's not even my favorite Coppola film.",positive
Thought Marlon Brando was SUPERB! Got really emotional when he died! :P :L But don't think Al Pacino can compare to him though! Just a seriously wicked film on the whole!,positive
am i allowed to say its slightly over rated??? good but all the hype is just over the top,negative
"An impressive piece revenge. How many films is Diane Keaton in? The son of a mafia boss starts as a war veteran, hardly the type to get involved with his family's underworld affairs. But slowly, as his brother dies, he becomes into a revenge killer himself. And finally, the Don himself. A great story of metamorphasis, changing from a peaceful man into a mob family head. I deducted 20% for the glorification of the mob and their use of the Catholic faith to lend any form of credence to this monsterous tale.",positive
"BEST MOVIE TRILOGY, 2ND TO STAR WARS!!!!",positive
"Waw Alpacino , you were and still one of the greatest actors ever !",positive
"Iconic and amazing. A great film, if overly long",positive

The Best movie ever......,positive
One of the greatest gangster epics of all time.,positive
Great gangster movie. Positively thrilling.,positive
"A great movie, seriously...",positive
"Greatest movie ever made, period.",positive
"I am decidedly not of the opinion this is the greatest movie of all time, or the greatest gangster movie or even the greatest Frances Ford Coppolla Movie it's been out done on all accounts but it'd be ignorant to say that means it's not worth the viewing or is even particularly overrated which it is not. Coppola showed himself to be an understated genius in this breakaway classic about the family life of gangsters and criminals. Marlon Brando stars as pater familias Don Vito Corleone in perhaps his most defining role (he got that drawl from putting cotton balls in his mouth) trying to maintain his hold over New York City as Drug Dealers and crooked cops (Sterling Hayden always a welcome antagonist) threaten him and his family but what surprised most people and set this apart in the world of gangster movies is Vito is pretty damn likeable in a not Hollywood way and A LOT of the movie more interested in the progression of his children who kind of have a Karamazovian dynamic the eldest hot blooded Sonny (James Caan giving a flawless performance) kind of strangely aloof Fredo (the underrated and sadly departed John Cazale) who unlike the Karamazov parrallel Ivan is stupid not intelligent and the innocent kind hearted youngest Michael (Al Pacino proving why he's one of the greats). The film and especially the sequels spends a lot of time tracing Michaels tragic Grecian rise and fall and features above all else...subtlety which is good it's 3 hrs if it were a modern shoot em up it would be even more exhausting. Yes there is action, the equivalent of a driveby, an exploding car the infamous restaraunt scene and the bloody conclusion but really the movie's more concerned with how it gets you there taking it's sweet time and building up tension till you're muscles are on edge and your ready to attack something if the action doesnt occur soon. With it's beatiful cinematography, low key ominous Italian soundtrack and knockout performances from a few of cinemas big guns this is a movie any film geek worth a grain of goddamn already has in their DVD collection and is well worth the continual rewatching that will follow",positive
One of the best MOB movies yet Al Pacino takes the cake!!!!!!!!!,positive
One of the best movies of all time,positive
Perhaps the ultimate mafia film with the best possible cast.,positive
"It really exceeds in all categories of filmmaking. Performances, Story, Direction Cinematography, Set Design,etc. It's such a beautiful film. There's just something incredibly authentic about it. It's arguably the best film ever made, and undoubtedly the best gang film ever done.",positive
Such a piece of perfect film making is rare.,positive
So great! Gotta love this film!,positive
"Probably the best thing american audiences ever put their eyes on. The Godfather is an American Classic, it's so beautiful and mesmerizing that it puts you into a world of organized crime and gangsters, and just the drawback of how that all plays out. The acting is supberb, Marlon Brando gives out his best here as the Don and has that respectable look, and has many great monologues between the characters, his presence is exceptional, you feel like he is the star and the leading character of this film, the way he's so respected in this world made me respect him. Al Pacino was fantastic as Michael Corleone, his quiet tone at the beginning and his change in his character is haunting as he becomes the new Don at the end of the film. James Cann is terrific as Sonny Corleone, he's the tough, revenge type guy, and you really feel the violent acts that he puts through other people. Robert Duvall gives out one of my favorite characaters, Tom Hagen, i feel that he is always giving his best when it comes to his scenes, espicially one scene in The Godfather Part II, where i will explain it in my review. John Cazale is great as Fredo, and gives the party vibe of the whole thing. Along with so many other supporting people that are just terrific, phonenomonol casting. The direction is terrific, i feel that F. Ford Coppola gave it his all when he was getting fucked at by the studios and so rushed to get his masterpiece finished, but with allt he trouble, it seems like he took his time with the material that was presented to him. The script is excellent, all the dialouge scenes and monologues are beyond geinus, and present some of the best dialogue ever. The death scenes are really memorable to when Sonny was shot in the cuaseway, to Apolonia's death with the bomb in the car, and the death of the don, this movie is very emotionally complex because you just become a part of these characters then just watching them, you really feel something for them, while they are the bad guys of our world, they really are the good guys in their world, and that's where we are, in our eyes. The memorable score by Nino Rota is some ofthe best ever, it really creates some sort of emotional essecence to the film, in it's mood. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is simple but poignant, maybe if i had a little complaint, it was the only thing that draw me in was the camera work. The Godfather is an epic masterpiece about family, life, faith, revenge, greed. Simply Perfect!",positive
"""I'm gonna give him an offer he can't refuse..."" A milestone in not only crime films, but also a milestone in cinema, Francis Ford Coppolla's gangster epic ""The Godfather"" is a complete masterpiece. Coppolla crafted a perfectly shot mafia film that has it all. A film that has intrigued countless, and continues to entertain throught the test of time. One of those rare films that captures everything, from the emotion to the tension and violence perfectly. A genuine masterpiece, when Coppolla was in his prime he was unmatched in talent. Powerfully riveting extremely violent, utterly dark, romantically intriguing, flawlessly shot, and perfectly executed, this film is shrouded in a cloud of brilliance. Crime has never been more realistically captured on film, Coppolla and company executed every aspect of this brilliant film with genius. Marlon Brando is legendary in one of the most iconic roles in cinematic history as the Goddather himself, Don Corleone. He is superb, a role that will not be matched and that has stood the test of time. Al Pacino is legendary himself as the rising son of the family, Michael Corleone. A character that is torn between the family business and a clean, crime-free living. James Caan is brilliant as the hot-headed and easily tempered Sonny Corleone. Robert Duvall gave one of his best performances as the family lawyer. A truly star-studded cast with enough talent to last an eternity. It's thrilling to see these great minds at work after so many years. Mario Puzo's book was brought to life on the big screen in an intensely realistic way, by a director that gives every film his all. From Apocalypse Now to The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppolla is and always will be a legendary director that will always be remembered for not only his epic films, but also the dedication and devotion that he puts into his movies. The Godfather is Coppolla at his best.",positive
One of the best movies of all time,positive
Wonderful. I was expecting it to be maybe one of those films eveyone just says is good because of it's reputation however it is actually an excellent film. Some fantastic iconic moments of cinema and some power house actors give a realistic portrayal of a mafia family pose WW2. Possibly the greatest gangster film of all time.,positive
"This is a Masterpiece that have been and will always set the bar for any motion pictures. Coppola, Brando and Pacino have given me an offer I could not refuse. An offer for me to embrace this film with my whole heart, and I took it fiercely and dearly.",positive
2nd best movie of all time.,positive

Marlon Brando delivers one of his most breathtaking performances in this classic piece of cinema that truely captures almost every human emotion imaginable. Great acting and an amazing script make The Godfather THE must see film out of all cinema.,positive
One of the best American films of all time.,positive
I will surely say if anyone have not watched this movie before they die... They are 100% unlucky persons... Because This movie is the simply best movie for a gangsta subject and the story which makes me to think various parts of the godfather and the first part made me more interest to watch the second and the third part...<br/><br/>A silent way of killing and assassinations and unexpected turnings as they shot the godfather and especially Al Pacino great he rocked in this first part with this awesome acting...<br/><br/>He was a good actor i can feel him from this movie he swallowed every one's acting by his tremendous acting...<br/><br/>The story was so thrilled and we cant guess what will happen next... <br/><br/>A 1972 movie which really turned to be all time favorite movie of everyone who have watched it...<br/><br/>The story ended as if not continued in the second part...This story really made a big impression on me about the godfather life...<br/><br/>A great film where every technical and acting aspect proved by all...,positive
Nothing to say about this that hasn't been said already. It's the best of movie of all time.,positive
"It must be a sense of the ""hype"" factor when it comes to Hollywood's so called greatest movies of all time that damages my freshness when it comes to watching such a movie. It happened with Casablanca and it happened again with The Godfather. It's wonderfully crafted with amazing cinematography, score, writing, direction, and ensemble of great actors but it might be also my sense of taste when it comes to gangster movies. Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Marlon Brando are all great in this but the shining stars for me were the women Talia Shire and Diane Keaton though underused. It's a great movie but I can't say it one of the best I've ever seen",positive

For a 1972 film this film is violent I was surprised and this film was way ahead of its time and Marlon Brando deserved the oscer he won!,positive
The second greatest movie of all time!!!,positive
"A classic. One of the best movies ever made, and one of the most memorable perfomances in the film industry by Marlon Brando.",positive
"Can you believe it? I had never seen this movie before until today. Of course, I've been meaning to see it for quite some time, but I've never gotten around it to, perhaps due to the length of the movie. And what do I think of it? It's absolutely fantastic.",positive
"That Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is one of the greatest movies ever put celluloid goes without saying. However, the multiple layers found within each viewing concerning the rise and fall of characters, the depth of emotion, and the unsure nature of passing the baton to the next generation so that they may pave their own way upon the shoulders which the older has provided-- it is these things which makes ""The Godfather"" and enduring classic. The Academy can keep their awards, it is the people who devote their lives to good movies of every kind which give this film its greatest honor. Simply to be remembered.",positive
Masterpiece - plain and simple.,positive
best movie ever made:*,positive
Pacino's second best role ever. Obviously a classic.,positive
great but too long !!!,positive
"If ever a film was overrated and a boring waste of 3 hours........it wasnt this. The film I was talking about was Transformers 2. This film is perfection, literally perfect like a robot but not a film I 'enjoyed', I appreciated it but not 'enjoyed'. I wouldn't wantch it again and it got hard to follow but it was the perfect movie. But honestly, I'd rather watch Predator",positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
"L'Ã©cran est noir. ""I believe in America"". Brando est assis dans son bureau aux stores de bois. La tension est palpable. Les couleurs sont Ã  la fois sombres et riches comme les tableaux du Caravage, le contraste avec l'extÃ©rieur ensoleillÃ©, lÃ©ger et festif est total. Le ton est donnÃ©. Ce n'est pas un film de gangsters. C'est une mÃ©taphore de l'AmÃ©rique et la famille. Une tragÃ©die Ã  l'antique. Un film dont personne ne voulait, avec des acteurs que personne ne voulait et un rÃ©alisateur en qui personne ne croyait. Et une musique qui prend Ã  la gorge. Chaque fois. I believe in Coppola.",positive
watch the three parts together...and you will have wonderful journey,positive
Some of the best dialogue in film. Beautifully shot as well.,positive
"What I liked: One of, if not THE greatest movie ever made. Literally NOTHING can be faulted with the Godfather. It's not just a bland, 2D film about gangsters, it's about family, it's about loylaty, betrayl and consequences. Its about the effects of war emulated by the ongoing power struggle of the five families. It's about the loss of a son, about how relationships come end, about how we all act diffrently around diffrent people. It's about burdens, legacies, reputations. Scumbags and public heroes. The cast all fit into their roles like a glove. Marlon Brando delivers a performance so enchanting you will never forget him. His voice is old but beneath it you can hear the power, fear and respect his fellow mobsters give him. One of Pacinos earliest and greatest ever role is in this film as the young son who is forced to take up his fathers place, documenting his emotional and professional development. The story is excellent with many far reaching sub plt within, such as Michaels love life, his flawed marriage, his glorious past contardicting his criminal future. The war with the families etc. What I didn;t like: At the end of the day I said that nothing couldn't be faulted with the Godfather, and it can't, but I will say this. If there was one thing about it that isn't honest, is that it isn't accurate. In this film we love the chacters, we feel for them and want them to win, but at the end of the day they are gangsters. In real life, the families of new York were hardened killers, power hungry sub-human animals who would slaughter children to satisfy their greed. This is not seen in the Godfathe, but if they had included this, it wouldn;t be the film it is. COnclusion: One of the best films you will ever see, it might become your favorite as it has so many others, all I know is that the film will never be forgotten and is a strong contender for my favorite film of all time. If you havn't seen this, do so the second you can!",positive

"The Godfather is one of the few films in history that has virtually no flaws in any aspect of its production. As the first truly great crime film, everything about this film is excellent: the acting is brilliant, the music is superb, the direction is flawless, and every camera shot is nothing short of perfect. It is tough to fully explain this film, so I won't, as it is simply something you have to see, as The Godfather ""makes you an offer you can't refuse"".",positive

"Cast: Al Pacino Marlon Brando James Caan Mario Puzo Directors: Francis Ford Coppola Screenwriters: Mario Puzo Francis Ford Coppola Running Time: 175 minutes Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's The Godfather is regarded as such an important cinematic classic that it's easy to forget what a bold undertaking it was and how unconventional Coppola decided to make it. Here is adramatic and violent story, epic in scope, that begins with a thirty minute wedding celebration that has very little plot advancement, no action, and introduces about twenty key characters. The payoff comes later when we feel like we know these people like our own family. I'm interested to know what it was like to see it in 1972. What did people think as Vito, Sonny, Michael, Kay, Fredo, Tessio, Clemenza, and all the others are presented, sometimes for fleeting moments in those opening moments? The plot is only set up in a cursory way as the Corleone patriarch Vito takes meetings in his darkened study, plotting sinister deeds behind closed doors while hundreds of guests celebrate his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding in the bright sunshine outside. So much information is thrown at the audience during the opening that I can't imagine anyone retaining it all the first time. At this point the movie is so ingrained in me that I don't even think of the actors when I'm watching the movie. When I see Marlon Brando on the screen, I'm thinking about Vito Corleone. I don't see James Caan. I see Sonny. The Godfather is pure cinematic brilliance at every possible level. From the marvelous acting in every role right on down to the costume design that helps set Michael and Kay apart as outsiders in the opening wedding. Can we now imagine anyone else in the lead roles? Could anyone but James Caan have captured the explosiveness and exuberance that is Sonny Corleone? It's as if Marlon Brando was born to play Vito. Who but John Cazale could have made so much of Fredo's limited role in the first film? He is a natural sad-sack, impotent in the face of assassins after his father and completely lacking in imagination while working under Moe Green in Las Vegas. Robert Duvall is Tom Hagen through and through. And Al Pacino was the great revelation as Michael, the youngest son who was never supposed to get involved in the family business and then dives in head first. The studio famously wanted a known star like Jack Nicholson, Ryan O'Neal, or Robert Redford for Michael - all of whom would have been profoundly wrong. The plot, as it is finally set in motion about 25 minutes in, is mostly about a mafia crime family whose boss wants to hold fast to a proud tradition and refuses to offer protection and investment cash to the other families who are interested in expanding their spheres of influence from gambling and prostitution to include narcotics. Although Vito knows it stands to be a lucrative business venture, he also recognizes the inherent dangers involved and the almost certain possibility that the politicians and police he has in his pocket will distance themselves from him as a result. It is a man named Solozzo who propositions him. Solozzo (Al Lettieri) works for the Tattaglia family and in order for them to continue in their business, Vito has to be removed. And in a famous sequence, Corleone is gunned down on the streets of Little Italy. The turning point of the film, however, comes later when Michael visits his father in the hospital and discovers that the body guards have been called off. In a first hint of the smarts that will put Michael in power later, he immediately senses something is wrong and he makes all the right decisions to protect Vito. This precisely edited scene in the hospital is both beautiful and sad as Michael tells his father, ""I'm with you now."" Are Vito's tears from joy or sadness? The story moves in a different direction shortly after this as Michael orchestrates the assassination of Solozzo and a police captain and is forced to flee into hiding in Sicily, leaving behind Kay (Diane Keaton), the woman he loves. The narrative spends a great deal of time in the gorgeous landscapes of the Mediterranean island, with Gordon Willis's cinematography demonstrating that he can do expansive landscapes as pristinely as he does dimly lit interiors. The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo distills the sprawling novel to the essential drama that takes place over a roughly five year period beginning in August 1945. Puzo's novel encompasses Vito's rise to power in the 1920s, but they wisely left the back story out of the first film. It tightens the focus and allows us to sympathize a great deal with Vito without having to see that he, too, murdered and stole to achieve greatness. Together, they crafted a story that was little more than a lurid pulp novel into a story of great, almost Shakespearean heft with notes of Greek tragedy. Ultimately The Godfather is a story of a family. More precisely than that, it's about Vito and Michael. The title readily refers to both men. As a young director, Coppola still had the courage to take the time out to show familial relationships and build characters. One of the family's caporegimes (a kind of lieutenant), Peter Clemenza played by the great Richard Castellano, takes the time to demonstrate for Michael how to make a proper tomato sauce. In the closing moments, as someone close to the Corleone family is revealed to have betrayed them, Coppola makes the right decision in keeping his murder off screen. We are supposed to feel melancholy at the choices these men make. When you've seen the second film (or read the book) and understand the full extent of that man's history with the Corleone's, his betrayal is even more profound. The whole movie is crammed with great scenes. The great director Howard Hawks famously remarked that what constitutes a great movie is three great scenes and no bad ones. By that standard, The Godfather should be held aloft in the stratosphere. There's not a single bad scene to be spoken of and I could easily rattle off half a dozen great ones: the opening scene with Bonasera asking a favor; the horse head scene; Vito gunned down; Michael saves his father; Michael's makes his bones; the montage that wraps up the action and the plot intercut with the baptism of a child. It was reportedly Pacino's performance in the scene where he kills Solozzo that saved him from being cut from the film. All the tension and emotion in that entire scene is written on Pacino's face - in his expressive eyes, his tightened jaw, his stiff upper body. What continues to resonate so deeply for me every time I see the film is the power of Nino Rota's haunting and beautiful score, in particular the main theme. I nearly always have to choke back a lump in my throat when I hear it, especially in the closing moments of the film as Kay looks on as Michael becomes the new Godfather and the door shuts her out. It makes me think of the sadness I feel when, after delivering the story of Luca Brasi holding a gun to a man's head at Vito's behest, Michael says to Kay, ""That's my family. It's not me."" We know what he will become when we hear him say that. We also know that to some extent he falls into power after doing what any son would do to protect his father. After all, Michael is a Corleone. He's unable to deny that. After all, it's all in the family.",positive
"***** Excellent. An epic tale of family, love, loyalty and deceit. Whilst Marlon Brando is brilliant in his role, so too is Al Pacino.",positive

"That's right, I've officially jumped on the band wagon, and have reviewed the godfathr, having watched it recently. While I worry that in later years it will become overrated,due to constant lists calling it the greatest film ever, and while I don't think it is, it's probably in my top 10. This just has all the elements of a classic. Quotability,action sequences, amazing scenes, emotion, depth, this has it all. Its a film that, for me, is about respect and diginity. Each character brings grace to the film. Obviously the best performance is Marlon Brando, one of the greatest acting roles in history. Al Pacino is superb as Michael, James Caan is great, in fact, just about everyone is brilliant in this fil. Certainly one everyone should watch, as I guarantee most will enjoy it, one of the all time classics",positive

Classic such great actors witha great story. i can't say enough how much i like this movie.,positive
The Godfather is the Godfather to all other Mafia films. It tells of the Corleone family and how they keep their business running and the troubles of it. Francis Ford Coppola directed the best picture winner and did a stunning job doing so. There are many shots in this film that can never be forgotten. The acting is superb by the whole cast. This is a truly enjoyable film and I would recommend it to anyone.,positive
It's The Godfather.. nuff said,positive
"The Greatest Movie Ever Made, The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy.",positive
You have to be completely retarded to give this anything but 100%,positive
Still has the amazement factor even though I've seen it's 50 times. This definetly stood the test of time,positive

"Sebagai salah satu film yang banyak direkomendasikan oleh para pecinta film akhirnya mau tidak mau saya merasa harus menyaksikan film ini. Dan seperti review saya untuk film Fatal Attraction, merating film klasik menjadi dilematis. Walaupun bukan genre favorit, film drama kriminal yang istimewa semacam The Departed atau Scarface pun pada akhirnya bisa dinikmati dengan mudah. Saya benar-benar kesulitan menikmati film ini. Tidak ada action yang cukup memorable, jalan ceritanya tidak sulit untuk diikuti tapi terlalu banyak sub plot dan tokoh yang dimunculkan. Satu-satunya yang saya nikmati hanya perjalanan hidup si Micahel Corleone yang bertransformasi dari anak kuliahan menjadi seorang Godfather. Selebihnya, intrik yang dihadirkan hanya lalu-lalang kesana-kemari dan disajikan dengan dialog-dialog panjang menjadikan saya kurang cukup ter-intrigue untuk mengikuti jalan ceritanya. Kalau sudah begini, perlukah saya menonton jilid 2 dan 3 nya?",negative
A great movie with great performances especially marlon brando and al pacino,positive
to me the greatest film of all time. the developemnt of all the characters is outstanding. and the morall battle of micheal in how he doesnt want to fall into his family buisness but cant fight his destiny is epic. it truley paints the picture of a man and his fate. are we truley the decider of our lifes?,positive

"What else can be said of Frances Ford Coppola's masterpiece ""The Godfather."" Deemed by copious critics as one of the greatest films of all time, it continues to be an ensign of the mafia movie. Brando, Pacino, Keaton, Duvall and Caan slip into their roles in part of the great Corleone family. This is the brand of movie that makes you want to join the mafia, whether as grunt or go to guy. ""The Godfather"" will continue to stand the test of time as new generations discover the beauty of being bad. Watching this film is like an offer you can't refuse.",positive

"It the masterpiece that changed the cinema, but I have a question. Are all gangster's sociopaths? Why is there always; ALWAYS that crazy gangster? And don't pretend the Godfather was the first movie who had a nut job like Sonny in it; it wasn't. I just feel that even though these gangster films are masterpieces; Goodfellas, The Godfather, The Godfather Part 2, etc.; they really do not accurately depict what causes a man to become a murderer. What pushes a man to the breaking point between sanity and insanity? To the point where he decides it is necessary to take the easy foul-trodden path to success. That's what Hollywood has never quite gotten right. But despite that; this film was a turning point for the American Cinema.",positive

"though at times it's a little slow, this film is excellently comprised with beautiful imagery, masterful directing, and fantastic acting. its one of the few mafia movies that truly captures the reality of it all, or, to be more exact, shows it in a more realistic, believable way. this is one of the few films you'll find where what you get is actually better, and i mean way better, than the book it was based upon. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino both perform exceptionally, and are my two favorite aspects of The Godfather.",positive

"When others try and claim a movie is great, they always say ""_____ was the GODFATHER of all (insert genre here) films"". The Godfather is it. This is the greatest and most enjoyable film ever made. The only films that possibly rival The Godfather for that very title are Citizen Kane (which I'm not even a fan of), and it's own sequel, The Godfather Part II! As a film student, we would always aspire to make such a great film as Francis Ford Coppola accomplished in 1972. The directing, cinematography, acting, editing, and script are all as perfect as any human being could possibly achieve, and I feel honored just being able to write about this masterpiece. Acting: Marlon Brando plays the Godfather himself, ""Don"" Vito Corleone, and in case you've been living a rock for the past 38 years, is the most iconic character in film history. No other character has been spoofed or copied more, aside from maybe Scarface's famous line ""Say hello to my little friend!"" Marlon Brando is barely recognizable in the film, with his total immersion as the character. Al Pacino co-stars as Michael Corleone, and gives a performance that could only be overshadowed by the late Brando. James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard S. Costellano, John Cazale, and Diane Keaton all had phenomenonal performances as well, each character with incredible depth. Cinematography: The Cinematography in the film is legendary, combining the dark elements of film noir with break-through lighting that caused heavy shadows over the eyes of Marlon Brando. Interviews with the Cinematographer, Gordon Willis, have shown that Mr. Willis intentionally created the shadow effect make the characters eyes looking dark and hollow, and leaving the viewier with a lasting impression. The film was darker than most films ever made, even during the film noir period in cinema. Directing: Francis Ford Coppola shouldn't be forgotten either. His style of directing created a family feeling that made any viewer, Italian and non-Italian alike, feel to be a part of the Corleones. Though the characters in the family are doing despicable acts, you root for the Corleones from start to finish. His opening monologue of ""I believe in America..."" all the way to the famous last shot of Clemenza giving his allegiance to Michael is masterfully executed. Script: The ability to quote a film may not be an indicator of how great a film is, but it still gives you an idea. The words ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" has become a staple in the realm of Hollywood cinema. The Godfather is line after line of great, realistic dialogue, with just the amount of shocks and thrills to keep any movie-goer wanting more. At the end of the day, if you haven't seen the Godfather yet, DO IT! This is a great film that will be studied and watched over and over for centuries to come. Sincerely, Another Film School Loser.",positive
Best Al Pacino performance in a trilogy you will ever see. See it!,positive
"""Do you know who I am? I'm MOE GREENE!!!"" While this is not my personal favorite film, this film is considered the best of all time. And i can see why. Marlon Brando gives an amazing performance as aging Mob-Boss, Vito Corleone. Every single actor in this film was laughably amazing. Laughably, in the fact that they all worked well together. This film started Al PAcino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall on the road to bieng some of the best actors ever. While not neccicarly artistic, my favorite scene is when the fat guy goes crazy and kills like 10 people, at the end.",positive

"A truly inspiring piece of cinematography, The Godfather gives an insightful view into the world of the Sicilian Mafia in New York City. Instead of as a federal agent or civilian looking in we see a view totally anew in gangster films of the time. Mario Puzo's The Godfather is truly the cinematic masterpiece we see it as today. The Godfather is undoubtedly the best film ever produced.",positive

DISCLAIMER: I wrote the same review for all 3 movies: If you are truly a movie connoisseur then you have to watch these movie (YESS ALLL 3) to really understand what movies are all about. And I mean all movies.... These movies are truly a work of art.,positive
"A triumph in cinema. As story unfolds, you can here the tension and drama sizzling under Coppola's vivid/picturesque portrayal of 1940s crime life. James Caan, Al Pacino, and Robert Duvall could not be better and fit their characters perfectly. Though not Marlon Brando's finest performance, easily his most respectable. The greatest American film of all time, without a doubt. 100/100",positive

I never saw it come up on t.v. and the sudden violence is the only obvious reason, though filled with facts about life and respect but I guess their right, you gotta be bit mature to get it too aswell as its not ment for anyone and everyone. The cast performance were as solem excellence as the score and the direction did a lot for the story as it kinda does get boring ...because of the fast to slow slow to fast pace changes it takes. Being dialog specific it takes attention to view and thus people enjoy that what they pay attention to, anyway that's the basics, so yea we're all followers in a way and this kind of film about these kind of people know how to let you how to be the best kind of followers ...if need be, hard times harsh measures. A great generational description of that for regard from other nations. Cannot wait to see the second (its only a movie) 'Godfather' part to the trilogy.",positive
"I've never understood why this movie is so highly regarded. It's mediocre, at best.",negative
"I prefer the second one...though this movie is amazing: great acting, directing, action...everything",positive
There Will Never Be A Better Film Than This,positive
Simply the best movie ever,positive
Great movie but I think goodfellas is better.,positive
Clearly the best gangster film in history...possibly the film in all of cinema history. Great performance by the entire cast and an incredible story shoot The Godfather into a genre of its own.,positive

"Doubtlessly the greatest film in american cinema, with equally perfected acting performances by the entire cast. This film brought the majority of it's actors to Hollywood superstardom, and with good reason. A very intriguing movie that is a must-see for anyone.",positive
Simply put this is the best movie of all time. Nothing else to say about that.,positive
Classic movie! Perfect Brando!! Perfect Pacino. Brando stuffed cotton balls in his mouth for the scenes to get that sound and look when he talked,positive
one of the greatest gangster movies ever made. its not my favorite mob movie but its in my top 3. it is excellent. Grade: A,positive
Master class movie A must see,positive
"Classic, skillful storytelling, they don't make movies like this one anymore",positive
"An epic masterspiece. ""I'm going to make him an offer, he can't refuse."" - Vito Corleone",positive
"A perfect piece of cinema; absolutely everyone is cast into the right roles, the direction always focuses on the right shot, and the screenplay is well-paced. Marlon Brando draws you in from the very first scene with his well-tailored performance of the Don, and Al Pacino carries the rest of the spectacle with his very subtle and sly role as the ultimately tragic of characters: Michael Corleone.",positive
"We are romanced into the plush lifestyle of some of America's most evil people. And not only to we sympathise with them, we fall for them.",positive
"One of the greatest(if not greatest) films of all time. Brando, Pacino(in his prime) make for the most epic telling of of organized crime in history. Often copied but never duplicated The Godfather stands in the pantheon of great cinema.",positive
"1st one was excellent, but I do like Gangster movies.",positive
obviously one of the greatest films ever made,positive
"The Godfather is the rare film that gets everything right: memorable performances, beautifully mysterious cinematography, a terrific screenplay, and that haunting score from Nino Rota.",positive
"This film speaks for itself. The best thing about it is that it fully embodies the Italian lifestyle. It was a nightmarish process of actually getting the film made, but it was obviously worth it.",positive
The Greatest film of all time and my personel favorite. Truly a movie that stands the test of time. Could watch it over and over.,positive
TREND SETTING REALISTIC WORLD CINEMA.,positive
Brilliant acting by the cast. Everything about it is near-perfect and the montage of hits is one of the best next to Brando's scenes.,positive
best movie of all time,positive

A great Classic about the Mafia.,positive
"A masterpiece, but part 2 is in my opinion the best.",positive
Marlon Brando Al Pacino how can i not rate this movie,positive
I fell asleep so this rating means nothing,negative
One of my favorite movies!!!,positive
"The ultimate gangster franchise, this is the beging of the best trilogy ever!! With a fantastic cast, who seem to seamlessly gel on screen. The film is as a good an account of the book your ever likely to see.",positive
One of my favorite movies,positive
"Warning this movie may bore you the first time you watch it. It was really boring the first time I watched it, but after watching it a second and third time I saw why it simply is an amazing film. I would rank this movie a 99.4/100 simply because it wasn't perfect(no movie really is) but it does have a great plot and great character development. I recommend watching this movie twice or more so you could see how much you like it.",positive
"It is quite simply the greatest film of all time. It's given a run for it money by few films, it's very own sequal to name one, and is held together by such terrific cast and crew members. The script written by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo as an adapation of the latter's novel is a masterpiece by itself. With genius directing from Coppola (whom would only not win for his directing on this film) gives already great actors extreme focus. Marlon Brando would win Best Actor and lead an all star cast of younger actors to major success as the highly respected Don Vito Corleone. James Caan and Robert Duvall shared nods for Best Supporting Actor as the hothead heir and intelligent lawyer with Al Pacino who masterfully transforms Michael from his days as a war hero to a vicious head of the Corleone Family. What little special effects used are superb and the music is unforgettable. To anyone watching this the first time I implore that you be very quite and pat close attetion not to miss anything important. As this film is so timeless it started a few clishes of it's own and to add one to the review: Sit back, relax, and enjoy because watching The Godfather is an offer no one can refuse.",positive
"Connor Macgregor Reviews...The Godfather Fellow MZP Posters,I come here today to do a review of a film close to my heart and to other people`s hearts as well. It is in my opinion The Greatest Film Ever Made and My Favourite Film Of All Time. The Godfather. The story begins as ""Don"" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia ""family"", oversees his daughter's wedding. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and ""family"". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don's fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the family. Honestly within ten minutes of this film, i was in this wonderful but dark world by a click. Its an emotional place with emotional characters who are fighting for power and a place in the new world. Lets talk about The Corleone Family. Marlon Brando plays the wondeful character Vito Corleone. The character is full of wisdom and charm,yet he has a sinister past that has changed him into a ruthless mob boss. He cares for his kids and wants what is best for them,but knows that they will become like him. James Caan plays the ruthless Sonny Corleone. I love this character and how he is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode and that time bomb reaches implosion when he discovers what has been happening to a certain family member. Robert Duvall plays Tom Hagen who in my opinion is a very underrated character and is one of my personal favourites. He is the real person running the business in a way. While Vito makes the decisions,Tom has to organise them. Then there is Talia Shire who plays Connie who i find is more emotional in this film than in The Rocky Series. She plays a much more vulnerable character than Adrian. Then there is Fredo who I at first wasn`t a big fan of in this film.But i did enjoy his performance much more this time. He is more lead about by other people and not as strong willed as the other corleones. But the stand out performance of the whole film is Al Pacino who plays Michael Corleone. This is where Al`s career began. Michael is a character unlike anyone has ever seen before. From sweet caring to ruthless and evil, his transformation is somewhat of a modern day greek tragedy. He starts off as a nice human being who served his time in the war. As he returns to his family and new girlfriend Kay, his life is about to change to a dark turn. Michael becomes more embroiled in the businesses of his family which strains his relationship with Kay. Its like something ou have never seen before. See the beginning of the film with Michael in his uniform and remember that image. Then at the end take a look at the new Michael and compare the differences. it is astonishing. The Score in this film will also go down in Movie History. Nina Rota creates something which is so special and so gifted that it honestly defines movie music. That infamous opening to the last note of the ending. It is just an amazing score. I want to talk also how dark this film is. It is as i said before a Modern Greek Tragedy. Its the story of how corruption effects even the innocent people and turns them into people that they aren`t. The characters are different and have different personalities and all go different changes in the film. This film truely puts itself up there with Casablanca,Citizen Kane & Gone With The Wind. Its a classic to be beloved by all and one that I MOST recommend above all my films. Rating - 100% - A+",positive

The Movie that started it all It has been made into 3 video games and not even the video game could capture the film magic that was this film few Movies can even compare to this film and if they do it is rare you will never see any greater performances out of the actors that were in this film its the movie that started my love for Al Pacino as a actor I was introduced to this film at a early age and thank god I was as I would have no appreciation for truly great film making if I were not this film should be a 10 star film but they don't have ten stars here so five stars will do I highly recommend everyone see this and watch it over and over a instant classic.,positive

"Squee! Just one left! Citizen Kane viewing/Rock Band victory party still on track for Sat. Boston area Facebook friends can expect invites soon, as Im working on that as soon as this write up is posted. I feel like no matter what I write about The Godfather, there's no way in hell I can \m/ do it justice. It just really is one of the greatest movies ever made. A fellow movie enthusist once pointed out that this is one of the few 3 hour films that uses those three hours effectively (the only other example we could come up with at the time was Magnolia, but Im sure there's a few others). And its so true. The movie is so engrossing, it just flies by. I was actually a bit concerned I'd miss movie time for Get Him to the Greek cause Id lose track of time watching this one. Still remember the first time I watched this. One of my best buddies realized that neither of us had seen this, which was abhorrent and unacceptable so we remedied that first chance we got. And both of us were just in awe, basking in the awesome of all things Italian. The characters are so cunning and complex. The plot is so twisted and terribly engrossing. The actors top notch. The direction brilliant. I also highly recommend the book. I read it a couple years ago. The movie follows it pretty accurately, but there's so much more. There's more elaborate backstories on the characters (my favorite being more stuff on Johnny Fontaine). And its a pretty easy read too. It also helps clear up some of the confusion, or at least I still cant keep a lot of people and motives straight. Guess I should prolly stop cause all Im doing is gushing. And Im getting sleepy. http://expletivedleted.livejournal.com http://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted",positive
"One of the greatest american films of all time, 5 stars for sure",positive
"Gran película, tensa, violenta, elegantemente filmada y de muy buen ritmo, que cuenta el drama familiar de una familia de la mafia. Destacables las actuaciones de Marlon Brando en un papel magistral, como el gran Vito Corleone, y Al Pacino que logra momentos y gestos inolvidables.",positive
So memorable. You can watch this film 50 years later and it'll still have the same influence that it did when it was first released.,positive
"I love the story of the Godfather movies. None of the characters are respectable in any sense, but that's what makes if fun. The only thing that is annoying is Marlon Brando's fake accent, but other than that, thumbs ups.",positive
Magnificent ! The best..Hurray for Coppola,positive
Perfection wouldn't start to describe the power of The Godfather. Once you enter the world of the Corelone family you get sucked right in to a different kind of animal. The Godfather encompasses family values and loyalty; as well as violence and the cruel life style in the mob. No movie has the suspense or thrills like this coppola classic. No movie has the star power as does The Godfather. No moive comes close. Hands down The Godfather is the greatest movie ever.,positive
BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive

"The Godfather is one of the greatest films in cinematic history. This is a spectacular crime drama. Francis Ford Coppola directs this stellar film. Based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, The Godfather remains one of the greatest crime films ever filmed. A true masterpiece, The Godfather is still impressive nearly 40 years after it's initial release. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give stunning performances. The Godfather is the ultimate mafia / gangster film, it's in a league of it's own. The film follows the Corleone crime family and the violence that unfolds in the mafia underworld. A film not to be missed, The Godfather is a thrilling, dramatic and violent look at the mafia underworld. A true classic and masterpiece. The Godfather is a definite milestone in cinema, and remains one of the greatest crime films ever made. If you are going to watch one gangster film, make it this one. A stellar cast with a great story make this one a truly unique epic. This is a film that has some of the greatest scenes ever filmed. For example, the horses head scene, Michael Corleone gunning down Sallozo and McClusky in the restaurant, Sonny's death. The list goes on. Francis Ford Coppola has made the definitive mafia film. If you've never seen The Godfather before, do yourself a favor and rent it. If you adore epic cinema, then this is the film for you. I could go on and on about how great this film is. This film has been largely unmatched in the genre, there's been a few great ones as well that has come close to the epic scope of this film, and a few do. Most notably, Goodfellas and Once Upon A Time In America. However, The Godfather will always remain the king of gangster mafia films because of it's many legendary scene and quotes. A film staring the now legendary Al Pacino and the start of his career showcases the power he has as an actor, and this film proved it. Coppola has definitely assembled a unique cast here, one that truly delivers a unique film experience that you will never forget. Love it or hate it, The Godfather's legacy speaks for itself.",positive
"It is one of the movies I get to watch over and over again and never get tired. The story is flawless. Normally people will dread and hate mafia, but in this movie, I get to love and respect the mafia boss played by Marlon Brandon. He is a very loving and compassion head of a closely knitted family structure, and a friend to many when in time of despair. Though he run joints involve in prostitution and illegal gambling, I can say they are of lesser evil compared to illegal drugs which he is against and nearly cost his life.",positive
Great film of the mafia! Such good action! Oh and its just businesss,positive
An undeniably well-made mobster film that inspired so many to come after it. The acting is marvelous as is the story. Marlon Brando does a fantastic job in the lead role.,positive
Well done and engaging.,positive
Perfect. you'll learn so many lessons- if you haven't seen it ---WATCH IT---it is my number 1 movie of all time!!! The most incredible thing I learned was to respect before to love. Family is everything,positive
MASTERPIECE!!!! Oh man I could write a novel on how much I love this movie! This is the most perfect movie I have ever seen and my 3rd favorite (behind Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas) I could watch this anyday of the week and be 100% attatched to the epic saga focusing on the Corleone family. The character development of Michael transforming from a WWII vet not becoming involved in the family business to becoming the Don is the greatest development I have ever seen. GREAT MOVIE!!!,positive
is there really anything that needs to be said?,positive
"While not a terrible film by any means, to quote Peter Griffin, ""It insists upon itself.""",negative
First saw this as a 14/15 year old and didn't get what all the hype was about. But it's as brilliant as all the critics say. Marlon Brando is sublime but Pacino's is one of the great transformations and it seems to me a shame he never received an oscar for this.,positive
"Screenplay, casting, acting, cinematography, music, sound... perfect! The Godfather really should be seen with The Godfather Part II, which tends to get overlooked. Without Part II, watching The Godfrather is like leaving the theater after the first half of Macbeth.",positive
"Not just an exelent movie, a family. Copella could not have picked a better cast, all have chemestry and act without flaw. The godfather is one of those rare movies that simply gets better each time you watch it, true genius in film making",positive
"So many consider this film as one of the greatest, if not the greatset film in cinema history. So understandably I had great expectations of this film before watching it, and it met them. An intriguing story on 'family' and 'business'. Stellar performances from every member of the cast, non grater than Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as the youngest son, Michael Corleone. There are many memorable moments including the slaughter of Sonny and the horse head in the director's bed. An unforgettable film due to it's impressive screenplay, which was used as a canvas to paint such a masterpiece.",positive
It was good but hard to really get into it when I was on my computer. I'm going to order the next two through the DVD section on my netflix to be able to get into them better.,positive
"Perfect. Also, I see something new everytime I watch this.",positive
pardon my french but I love this fucking movie.,positive
LOVE EVERY GODFATHER MOVIE!!!,positive
"It's got everything of a well-made proactive drama. Good acting and direction, A well written script and visual style that is unlike any other movie before or since. My personal favorite character is Sonny (played by James Caan), but I think everyone can relate closely to a certain character in this movie because it is in every sense of the phrase ""real life"". Acting is beyond what we see on the screen. And it was all brought out beautifully by Francis Ford Coppola. Its so perfect...you really couldn't change anything about it",positive
I 'll makd him an offer he can't refuse ...,positive
"If you haven't seen this Mobster epic, go watch it... shame on you!",positive
One of the only three hour type movies I'll watch over again. Gory but an enthralling epic. Pacino as Michael is as tragic a protagonist as they come. Gets even better with II (and should've stopped there).,positive
"the godfather is one of the most recognized and most popular films ever made. the storyline is classic and the action is top notch considering it was made in the 70's. its direction is brilliant and so are each of the characters that make up this masterpeice. a great gritty crime drama that hasn't been topped, nor will it ever be topped.",positive
The original gangster epic crime drama that still gets better with age and if it weren't for this movie 'The Sopranos' or 'GoodFellas' wouldn't be here.,positive
"The best of an incredible epic series of films. This is Coppola's second best effort, only exceeded by Apocalypse Now.",positive
"As it is very popular and it looks like a real proper magnicient film but mafia is not really my type, so in my opinion I didn't quite enjoyed it as much, sorry.",negative
"The Godfather Is One of the best movies ever made. A masterpiece a bout Family, Love, Revenge and violence. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are amazing. The Godfather is the best gangster movie, since ""Goodfellas"".",positive
My favorite Marlon Brando movie.,positive
one of the best movies ever made,positive
"What more can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?!?! Stop reading and start watching, it's an offer you can't refuse.",positive
This is the best crime movie ever made and has some of hollywoods best performances,positive
"An absolutely brilliant movie! One of the most solidly acted movies I've seen, from the lesser roles right through to Brando himself. However, it seemed to play out in three acts, and the second act (when Michael went to Sicily) became a little monotonous and you just found yourself itching to know what was happening back in America. The first act was definitely the best, but the movie did end on a very strong note as well. I think that Duvall is often overlooked beside Pacino and Brando, but he was really quite understatedly brilliant. The atmosphere this movie conjured was quite masterful.",positive
Boring movie about a bunch of scumbags. Skip it.,negative
Greatest film ever. Possibly!,positive
"The beginning of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece follows the epic tale of the Corleone family, a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. From 1972 on, every movie made in America has been made really to fulfill one sole purpose: to be better than ""The Godfather."" The most brilliant and perfect mix of drama, action, and romance, this gold standard of the silver screen is compelling from start to finish and appeals to every audience. Although Marlon Brando is billed as the star (and he is outstanding), Al Pacino shines in his greatest role ever as Michael Corleone, the youngest of Don Vito Corleone's three boys and the one who ultimately becomes the focal point of the film as well as the new Godfather. Over the course of what may be a four hour film (trust me, they fly by), you witness Pacino's flawless portrayal of the conflicted character, who evolves from the college grad who didn't want to mess with the family business to the cold blooded new Don that settles all the business in the end. Brando's part has been, in my opinion, overrated, due to the fact that he only appears in 3/4 of the movie, and half of that time he's in a coma from an assassination attempt. Nonetheless, when he's coherent he's magnificent, and even though Pacino and many years later Andy Garcia (as Vincenzo Mancini) would become the Don of the family, he will always be remembered as The Godfather. While Brando and Pacino shine, it's the supporting cast that makes it all come together. James Caan portrays Santino (Sonny) Corleone, Vito's hot-headed oldest son, to perfection. Robert Duvall is quietly brilliant as concierge Tom Hagen, who ends up being the only real ""good"" guy in the entire movie by its end. Diane Keaton gets the job done as Michael's eventual wife Kay Adams, but like many other fans of the series, I just find nothing interesting about her or her character and believe that perhaps the movie would've been better off without her. Nonetheless, it is intriguing to watch Kay slowly get tangled in Michael's business affairs toward the end of the movie, and it builds well into the sequel. From start to finish, The Godfather is the measuring stick for all American films because of it's across the board brilliance and its unforgettable moments. From the horse's head in the bed to the plethora of memorable quotes (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" and ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes"" are just two of them); it's hard to find any flaws in this masterpiece of American theater. Story: A Acting: A Direction: A Visuals: A Overall: A **** out of 4 stars",positive
A symbol of great cinematography. The Godfather is a great movie and will go down in history as one of the bests.,positive
"This has been on my ""Movies-to-Watch"" list ever since I started becoming a serious movie buff. Now that I finally got the time to see it, all I can say about this: FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC!",positive
"A classic in many ways, but to be honest it is a flawed movie that was improved considerable in the second part which was more complete. More a film full of brilliant scenes, yet there is another hour of it that is forgettable. High notes - Dr - Francis Ford Coppola. Ac - Al Pacino, James Caan, John Gazale. Music. Script. Photography.",positive
"Quite simply one of the best, if not the best, Hollywood movie ever made. Near perfection. Perfect acting, perfect script, perfect music, perfect directing. This has some of the best and most memorable lines of all time. Brando's performance is of course one of the best of all time, but it is one of many great performances. Pacino is fantastic as well. The scene with Michael and the Godfather in the Garden is priceless. If you see no other movie, see the Godfather.",positive
"A classic in every sense of the word - stellar performances by Brando, Pacino, Caan and Duvall. Memorable lines never to be forgotten - a movie to watch over and over!",positive
"A remarkable classic movie, with a lot of quotes and production cinema that defined what cinema is today.",positive
"How can you explain how amazing this movie is in words? This movie is the creme de la creme of movies. It's a piece of art. This movie was leaps and bounds ahead of its time when released, and in many ways it still is. Story, rock solid acting and cinematography. This movie is a legacy. Simply watch it. Over and over again.",positive
"How can you not put this in your top five? It has seriously the best of everything you could ever want in film. The acting has the best cast of all time with one of the best performinces in history from Brando. The story is so brilliant and ever so clever. The dialogue seriously can have famous one liners in every scene. The cinematography is the best ive ever seen. The overall direction from Coppola is ground breaking at the least, this movie changed things....forever. One of my favorites and definately one of the best of all time, if you appreciate film in any retrospective you must watch this film before you die.",positive
"what a great movie! Al Pacino looks so differnt in his youth! This is not an overtly violant movie, as it is tempered by the character's value for family and religion, which actually gives a peculiar quality of respectibility and even legitimacy to character's dealings.",positive
"Hard to believe, but my love for this picture is gone. Oh, I think it's an excellent film, well made and well directed, and definitely one of the best things Coppola ever did...but after years of adoration, I've started to agree with Coppola--this is hired work. It doesn't have the delirium of Apocalypse Now and his later films, or even the stubborn integrity of his latest, Tetro. I like it, I admire it, but the passion's worn thin--I can muster up a measure of respect, but my heart has stopped beating hard when I catch a glimpse on cable. In terms of directing and storytelling, I'm more impressed with what, say, James Gray did in ""We Own the Night""--in many ways a film that owes Coppola's a heavy debt, Gray's picture hews to a conservative storyline that it visualizes with punk brashness and grace.",negative
good movie of all time,positive
"Not only is The Godfather the BEST crime/gangster film ever made, it is one of the BEST films ever made! The Godfather is simplistic, yet sophisticated. It features unbelievable performances from all leads and co-stars. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, one of the greatest actors of all time ( maybe the best ) John Cazalle, Robert Duvall, and a personal favorite from the film, James Caan. I think it's something special. It's so artistic, that even the violent murder scenes seem like they are the most professioanl pieces of visionary ever made. It has everything right. Also, The Godfather is memorable in every way. Some of the greatest actors of all time, one of the greatest directors of all time ( 4th best in my opinion ) Francis Ford Coppola, and of course, everyone at least knows what this film has done for America, let alone seen it and loved it. In a nut shell, The Godfather is an elegant, majestic, iconic, fantastic film. I dont care how long it is, it's one of the greatest films ever made. Bravo!",positive

"Spectacular film, great all around, isn't much that needs to be said.",positive
"Reviewing a production as profound as The Godfather is a great pleasure and also an exercise in futility. Those who haven't seen the film aren't likely to rush out and grab a copy based solely on my affectionate analysis, and long-time fans shouldn't need additional prodding. As such, I'll leave the rigorous debating to the film historians, and simply focus on the success of the film, as well as my personal opinion on its relevance. Last year, I went on a 26-mile backpacking trip with a group of six friends with a variety of backgrounds. One of the guys in the group was raised without a television, and spent the better part of his 20's catching up on everything he missed in his childhood. As an outdoor lover, I find it hard to criticize anyone who chose to promote physical activity rather than sitting in front of the television, so despite the shock of a television-free childhood, I could understand his parents reasoning. What I couldn't understand, is how he managed to dig into everything under the sun during the past 12 years, and never take the time to watch The Godfather trilogy. He earned his fair share of group chastising while the rest of us praised Coppola's cinematic gems, and eventually promised to watch the films back-to-back during the inevitable recovery period at the conclusion of our trip. Whether or not he followed through is irrelevant, but our group discussion of The Godfather brought two things to light. First, I've never stumbled across another film series with such a loyal following. If you walk down the street and ask ten people if they've seen The Godfather, I'd imagine nine of them will say yes. Second, everyone who views the film will come away with a different analysis of what makes it so profound. Coppola didn't simply make an entertaining film; he made a masterpiece with limitless appeal. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is a well-respected leader among the Italian-American community. Hidden beneath the exterior of a businessman in the olive oil trade, Vito is a charming dictator with his hands in a variety of legitimate and criminal ventures. One day, the Corleone patriarch is approached by the representative of a rival family with a request for assistance in a profitable narcotics venture, which Vito refuses. This sets off a tragic war between the two families, and eventually leads to a leadership transfer from Vito to his son Michael (Al Pacino). Michael is a well-educated young man with conflicting ambitions. On the one hand, he wants to legitimize the family business and escape the violent world of organized crime. However, he soon realizes the rival families are out to ruin the Corleone family, and intend to remove the head of the organization in order to cripple the body. With a constant target on his back, Michael is forced down a crash-course on betrayal and deception, as he furiously battles to protect everything his father built. Nominated for eleven Academy Awards and winner of three (Best Picture, Best Writing, and Best Actor in a Leading Role for Marlon Brando), the 1972 release of The Godfather is an epic portrayal of organized crime, told through the sympathetic eyes of the individuals embroiled within the conflict. Heroes become villains and vice-versa, until the lines between good and evil converge onto a singular path. In many ways, the meteoric rise of the Corleone family could be compared to the rise of the American nation in the years following World War II, making The Godfather the quintessential ""American"" movie during the early 1970's. Naturally, there are a myriad of reasons why the film became such a huge success, but to this viewer it boils down to two key factors. Pure, unapologetic glee at witnessing the power of greed coupled with self-righteousness, and the violent struggle that results when humans attempt to take what isn't theirs. In my personal opinion, there has never been another film (except perhaps The Godfather, Part II) that captures the essence of a lifestyle that seems entirely foreign to 99.9 percent of the population, but also draws an associative link with 90 percent of viewers. I still can't comprehend how Coppola pulled off the balance in such a rewarding fashion, but it remains a true testament to his ability as a director. Despite Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone and his resulting Best Actor award, this will always be Al Pacino's film. Stepping into the shoes of Michael Corleone had to be an ominous undertaking for a 32 year-old actor with only two films under his belt, but Pacino quickly demonstrated his worth as the conflicted successor to the family business. Standing next to accomplished actors such as Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, Pacino likely felt like a fish out of water during the initial days of filming, but when you consider his character is initially portrayed as an outcast from the family business, he seems the perfect fit for Coppola's vision. His slight frame, wide-eyed expressions, and unusual tendency to hunch over make him appear far less capable of filling his father's massive shoes. Yet his vicious cunning and willingness to do whatever it takes draws the respect of his peers, and propels him into an almost god-like status. I often wonder where the Pacino of those days disappeared to, but perhaps we're simply realizing the importance of a talented director in bringing out the best in his actors.",positive
"The movie was powerful and riveting. The body language set the mood and scene in symbolic scenes. The connection from families and drama made the movie suspenseful. THe movie had a lot of morals and family rules that had to be followed. The Corleone family is an important asset in Sicilian life and people of New York, New York. People go to the Don for justification or help in return a favor will be called apon in the future. The symbolism in the movie makes movie critics wonder what things represent. Like the dead fish in the bulletproof vest which meant Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishs. The segments in the movie ws good and the dialogue the characters had between one another. It showd emotion of each character to read what they were thinking. THte msuic was a good touch for important scenes for family events like marriage and death. The movie emphasizes on how important weddings are and respect of family ties.",positive
"Honestly, who didn't like this movie? You? Go check your head if you do",positive
A film that has everything good! Possibly the best gangster film ever made.,positive
"""Mr. Corleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news at once."" In my opinion, this movie is as close to perfection as you can get. I could watch it 1000 times and never get bored! This is the only movie made before 1985 that my husband will watch!",positive
fuck citizen kane! the godfather is the best film of all time! francis ford coppola put all his time and effort into making this epic masterpiece! the godfather still entertains the fuck out of audiences and this film should be shown in every film school if you wanna make great film! my personal favorite film of all time!,positive
"Lyle: The Godfather is my favorite movie ever made, simply because there has never been a film as revolutionary in its storytelling abilities, and I don't think there will be another film like it. The Godfather features some of the greatest acting in film, especially by that of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys, who all studied under the method style of acting, know how to act. And act brilliantly. Marlon Brando is a forty-year-old playing a seventy-year-old, but his performance is so seamless, no one could detect it. And this film also went the extra mile to getting supporting characters who were all brilliant actors. James Caan, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton... This film is just saturated with one great performance after another. Bob: And it is a movie that really was written incredibly well. I really like this movie too because it is one of the few pictures I've ever seen that knew how to tell a three hour story using every single scene of the film. Sometimes I think newer audiences are turned off by The Godfather because they can't keep up with the story, but maybe that's because they don't know how to sit down and really watch a movie anymore. But The Godfather really is cinematic perfection, and, like you said, it is full of talented actors from beginning to end. There is not one actor in this movie who cannot act well. Lyle: Actually, there was one actor who could not act, but Francis Ford Coppola's direction saved it. The guy who played Luca Brazi. Remember? But Coppola set up the scene to make it look like it was a rehearsed speech he was given to the Godfather, and it saved the scene. Bob: Ah, yes. Francis Ford Coppola is one of the most brilliant directors I have ever seen, and nothing shows that better than The Godfather. Bob's Rating: ***** Lyle's Rating: ***** Overall: 100%",positive
A masterpiece of Coppola! Not just a movie about murders and happy trigger people but it's also about the importance of a family. Beautiful from detail to detail. Indescribable film.,positive

Despite having slow-pace proceeding lumbering approx 3 hour..I enomously enjoyed GODFATHER....Based on the novel of same name by MARIO PUZO....It's audacious crime film filled with tense moments....The performance is remarkably best from any other multi-starrer film.......MARLON BRANDO & AL PACINO delivers fire-cracker performance as Vito corleone & Michael Corleone........ Don't miss this movie at any cost........It's a film that opened new vistas for such theme.....",positive

There is nothing left to say about this masterpiece. One of the most important movies of all time.,positive
"What can I say? I'm a sucker for epics. And this epic just might be the best one in terms of true-drama crime saga type genre. And it may be a clichÃ© to have this movie on ANY buffâs list but hey, can you blame them? This is such a powerful and emotional movie there's not very many ways that you can't like it. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is top-notch, the score is befitting, and the story is just plane tragic. It's merely the way this movie plays out that I loved viewing. Just how it stretched out in long scenes and keeps us wanting to know what happens next. And what does? It delivers. Marlon Brando is sensational as Don Vito. He created such an ideal mobster and ""father"" figure it's no wonder he won the Oscar. Brando made this movie(it feels) more then Coppola himself. Not to say Coppola's bad, but it's just that the book really was a lot like the movie so it's all there for the director to pick up and ""direct."" The character of Don Vito seems it'd be hard to portray, but not for Brando who just jumped right in a gave a convincing come-back. Al Pacino also gives a transitional performance, as the once favorite and good son to the sinister, looming new Don. The aesthetic costumes matched the period of the 1930's well, so complete that with a beautiful score and it's all quite moving. Genuinely gripping, powerful experience.",positive

"An extremely long film to watch, slow at parts. But I don't think anyone will disagree that The Godfather is still a fantastic movie.

The best movie ever made in the history of CINEMA,positive
"A Film that never disappoints and definately Marlon Brando's best film, well acted and really gives you a glimpse into a usual mob family and proves that they are not all that murderous. What turned me off was Al Pacino, something about him within the film made him a less cared for character.",positive
"It's an offer you can't refuse. One of the GREATEST and Possibly the MOST INFLUENTIAL movies EVER.Hands DOWN. PERIOD. WORDS can't describe the genius in this film. Not only is it ranked as the second greatest film in American history but the Line ""I'm Gonna Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse"" is JUST as memorable. I think the thing too that people miss see in this film is that sure it's a film in the ""Gangster"" film but in Francis's own words ""It's a metaphor for AMERICAN Capitalism"" and it IS JUST THAT. The Godfather is trying to help EVERYONE in his family and around him the best he can BUT the METHODS in which he does it are not the usual kind and thus he is considered ""the enemy"" and if you see it in THAT perspective you see the ""Family Love"" in the film. EVERY TIME I watch the film I find myself just...speechless by the way Coppola took..the littlest details and added them into the film from the way they talk about making spaghetti sauce to how they talk about how drugs are a bad business. It's AMAZING. Another Great example of the ""Family Love"" is one of my FAVORITE scenes where you see the weeding and the people are all singing and dancing and at the same time The godfather is performing business and they don't care they're all just there to have fun and enjoy each other. BRILLIANT I'm going to be honest EVERY TIME I watch this film I'm amazed by the greatness of film and the way it's done. Even 40 years later it still holds up amazingly",positive
"A masterpiece! my favorite movie,the greatest gangster picture ever,and probably the best movie ever made! If movies like Little Caesar,Scarface(Both versions),Goodfellas or The Public Enemy made you hate those despicable human beings,with The Godfather you gonna feel really bad when some of these ¨bad guys¨ gets harmed. A great(and rare,BTW) gangster picture,wich puts the family,respect and honor over the business. This epic movie has it everything:A huge and great cast(Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,John Cazale,James Caan,Talia Shire and Diane Keaton),Brando giving us his best performance(yeah,even greatest than the one in On the Waterfront),romanticism(something rare on the gangster genre),one of the greatest music scores ever,the best killing scenes ever and a perfect ending! Stupid Fact: The BAFTA and The National Board of Review awarded Cabaret(wich is also a great movie,but nothing compared with The Godfather)as the best movie that year!",positive
"This movie is my favorite movie of all time. To me, this film is complete genius, there is no other movie in the world that had such an incredible impact on me or made me think so much about my own humanity. This film's cinematography is completely genius. The way that Coppola uses darkness and light to show the main character's inner struggle. If you watch closely you can see how as the movie goes on it gets inherently darker. It isn't always out right dark it is just that there are more shadows and the picture looks slightly grayer. Some of the most famous movie scenes ever are in this movie such as the opening one where we hear the words ""I made him an offer he couldn't refuse."" Which leads to the acting. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando have the best performances that I have seen of them in this movie. Al Pacino brings the character of Michael Corleone to life showing his inner tumoil of loving his family but also being concious of his disdain for what they do, and he depicts with great intensity yet subtlety Michael's slow transformation to ruthless Mob Boss. Marlon Brando proceeds to have one of those performances where you don't even realiz that it is him performing. He plays his character with finesse and cleverness. He also brings an air of dignity and honor to a character who runs a business with none of that. You can see the torment of not wanting Michael to end up like he did but knowing that it is too late to stop it. The music is also fitting in this movie. It brings the true italian spirit to the movie but also infuses it with the darkness that tends to lie behind even the most perfect looking family. It has a clear recurring melody that is easily memorable so it haunts you soon after the movie ends. This movie is a classic that every person should watch. There is SOOO much more I could write about this movie but I doubt there is enough space for all that I would want to write so I will stop now. I give it a 100 percent because it is a movie with an endless depth that isn't needed to see to still enjoy the movie.",positive
"rarely, if ever, can cinema summon the drama and the dramatic weight of a Greek tragedy, but this is the godfather, to cinema what Shakespeare is to literature.",positive
"robably the greatest movie of ALL TIME, The Godfather exceeds expectations in all aspects. Direction, acting, cinematography, deep story line, what could you want? No one can't can't this movie sucks, because it's just masterful. I don't care who you are, how old you are, or what country are you from; you must, and I say MUST, watch this film",positive
i wish i could give this more stars,positive
"The Godfather deserves to be recognised as one of the greatest films ever made. It's an epic story with an epic cast. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan...an unbelievably talented line up. Wonderful writing and some legendary scenes featuring fishes & a horse's head in a bed. It's not just a gangster movie though; this is a moving tale of the Corleone family and how the drive for security almost tears the family apart. The violence is not overplayed either. There are long brooding build-ups to the action, the most powerful of which is Michael Corleone's encounter with a police chief and rival boss in an Italian bistro. Electrifying stuff.",positive

"Without a doubt the best American-Italian gangsta movie. A brilliant adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel, without the allusions to sex and surgical 'tightening' techniques for certain conquests of Sonny Corleone. The other storylines, into Vito Corleone's past, are covered in the film's sequel Godfather Part II. Excellent casting with Al Pacino as the young war veteren who comes of age to avenge his father's would-be assassins. Vito Corleone has been timelessly portrayed by Marlon 'jor'el' Brando!

The best movie of all time.,positive
"It could be argued that Francis Ford Coppola's film of Mario Puzo's bestseller, at once an art movie and a commercial blockbuster, marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. Appropriately, the film is about a similar transition in organised crime, as the gentlemanly but sinister world of Don Vito (Brando) is eclipsed by the more brutal and expedient organisation represented by the doomed Sonny (Caan) and the calculating Michael (Pacino). With performances, style and substance to savour, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless.",positive

The Godfather I'm glad I started with this one. It was absolutely epic. Although, I think I need to watch it again to catch everything.

"I now understand why The Godfather is considered one of the greatest movies of all time. I just recently watched The Godfather and it is executed perfectly. I was hesitant at first because I had set such a high standard for it, which it surpassed. I really cared for all the chracters and got wrapped up in the story. The Godfather is a timeless classic and is what film making is all about.",positive
"My first review will be The Godfather I just watched the blue ray restoration of this film. I feel the same sense of awe every time i see this movie. Obviously the basics are covered there is great acting, great direction, amazing cinematography. These things make a good. What makes movies great are some of what the Godfather does best. One of these is the character development and contrast. It is truly amazing how Michael is developed throughout the film. It is never too quick and never to slow. Yet at the end he is almost unrecognizable from the beginning. Another great part about this film is the contrast of characters. It plays out like a true family. Some are quite people, some are quick to react. The Godfather doesn't just tell us this, it shows us. It gives the characters situations to show what they mean to others and to us. It allows us to fully relate to the characters. Along the family lines it shows a great representation of unconditional family love. The family truly respects one another, no matter the business outside of the family. It's odd to think that mobsters can feel this love, but the sense of family is amazing in this movie. Along with all these there are tense situations, action, pulling of strings, plotting, romance, and explosions! This movie has it all. I would highly suggest it! Also i would suggest watching through with the subtitles, it really can bring even more out of this film. The Godfather make us an offer we can't refuse!",positive

"I'm not going to try to add anything about this film that hasn't already been said a million times, but I'll do my best to express my opinions about it without delving into fanboy territory. Francis Ford Coppola's first installment in the epic gangster trilogy is, without a doubt, one of the finest films ever made. Nearly three hours in length, The Godfather features countless brilliant performances (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Talia Shire...just to name a few). While it is mercilessly violent, The Godfather toasts a warm theme: the simple joy of family. The connection the Corleone family has is terrifying to outsiders (and enemies) but it's very touching to see every single one of them be prepared to give their life for the rest of them. I absolutely cannot wait to watch Part II and visit this absolute masterpiece in the future.",positive
Classic but hard for me to pay attention too.,negative
"Considered by some as the greatest film ever made and its hard to argue with anybody about that. On my top 10 its #3 but it was #1 for a long time and in my mind it is a perfect movie I cant find anything wrong with it. From its masterful acting and superb dircting and the best book turned into film ever(you can thank Francis Coppla for that). And Marlon Brando who is considered by some the greatest actor of all time and its also hard to argue with that. So with a combination of the greatest actor, director, and screenwriter you get The Godfather. 100% Perfect.",positive
"Perhaps the greatest piece of film ever executed by anyone. Marlon Brando is spectacular, Al Pacino plays a subtle yet extremely important role, James Caan is excellent even though he is not italian and the entire cast is perfect. Tessio and Clemenza are exactly who I picture when i read the book. Coppola lives the audience in a state of amazement. And the closer, is when the Godfather, who has killed thousands of men, dies, the audience is saddened by this. That is touching greatness, well done.",positive

"Perfection in every way. It is a visually captivating film with a grand story to accompany it. Marlon Brando gave a flawless performance as Don Corleone, resulting in a sympathetic crime lord. Al Pacino gave just as strong of a performance, giving you a clear sense of downfall from a seemingly moralistic character into a ruthless businessman. The story covers everything from family values to revenge. It is perhaps the most epic narrative in cinema.",positive
"Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 classic, The Godfather based off the novel by Mario Puzo, is not only the best crime film but one of the greatest achievements in film history. First of all this movie has amazing acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino and many others. The storyline in The Godfather is great and flawless. At times it may be a bit confusing but you catch on pretty quick. The music in this movie is truly great and fits the mood of the movie. This movie is just about 3 hours long and you will never be not entertained. Overall Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 classic is one of the greatest films of all time. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone it is a movie you must see before you die. Even after almost 40 years of this movie being out it still remains one of the best movies out there.",positive
"Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect acting, perfect soundtrack... Perfect movie.",positive
"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels.

"A very dramatic and influential film. The Godfather is the God of all Mafia films. It has not only revolutionized modern cinema, but has also controlled it. The Godfather is the epitome of all mafia films that follow, it has influenced others and impacted many. It is the most accurate telling of the business in which the mafia deals with. The movie is also great in everyway. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and the others are the perfect cast. Their portrayal as actual mobsters are so life like, its almost unbelievable. The storyline is as steady as it gets and the script seems like actual Italian-Americans are talking to each other the way their suppose to. The plot misses nothing and is well put out. The movie itself is a near perfect (Being that the movie wasn't really funny). A must watch movie for everyone",positive

"The Godfather is not overrated, as it carries a brilliant cast through a brilliant plot whilst strung with a beautifully suspenseful soundtrack. There is near to no flaws in this film whilst it carries itself on many dark and uplifting tones. The Godfather deservedly owns a spot in cinematic history as the cream of the crop, and will always be held high in reputation.",positive

Loved it from the first view!,positive
"Well.... What do you say about a movie so adored, so set in our culture that its now a meme in the history of film, the history of the 20th century? With a film this admired there's left little to say that hasn't already been said; really, the only slightly different spin I can give on my review is that its postera and postmodern in the sense that my eyes examine the film with dulled respect due to the 40 years of movie and television that I've seen which have been so greatly inspired by these films that imitation was impossible to avoid, even in the best of those following productions. Where this should be (and is) the fault of the imitators, there's simply no way to avoid being less impressed by The Godfather than I perhaps should have been, and would have been had I not become so familiar with the conventions this movie had set. After seeing The Wire and The Sopranos- both of which really do set to bar for television, by the way- I had already experienced Coppola's ability to put morality to one side in order to get an objective and intimate look at the intrigue and intensity in these gangsters' lives; the great dialogue that sounds completely authentic and genuine; and the minimalistic direction that doesn't employ too much style, instead focusing much more greatly on the intricate narrative. The Godfather Part 1 is an outstanding film, epic in every respect. Coppola's characters are viciously heinous in their deeds but yet still the viewer can easily emote for them and, in a strange way, respect their honour and dignity. Characters like the well-mannered don Corleone are so memorable that almost every Italian American gangster that followed in film resembled him in some sense, the budding young Michael played by Al Pacino only begins to blossom in this part, and its not until Part 2 can one really respect the subtly of Pacino's acting here, but the rest of the extended cast all play their parts wonderfully too. This is one of the best acted movies I've ever seen, I can't deny that. There's little problems to be had with this film. I suppose it did feel a bit slow in places to me and a bit too long; they were issues, but certainly not a massive deal. This part of the saga serves as an introduction (a three hour introduction) and really needs to be seen before the other two parts, but after seeing this one, you really should pick up Part 2 because that's even better.",positive
Probely the best ganster movies that are goin will have to be the godfathers,positive
Marlon Brando is just so brilliant in this movie. I love the authentic Italian touches and the way FF Coppola used oranges to offset the dark colors struck me as really kinda neat too.,positive
I love this movie...why'd they go and mess up the trilogy with the last one?,positive
"I thought this was a very good film, but not a great one. It is compelling with a great story and fantastic acting but something didn't click with me, I lost interest in some parts and wanted to have it wrapped up a little bit. But I still liked it very much and would recommend it. Maybe I need to see it again, but I prefer Goodfellas.",positive
"There isnt much you can say that hasnt already been said. The godfather is not a movie as much as it is a piece of art. The three hours feel like three minutes. Its completely perfect. The acting is passionate and subtle when needed, the writing is terrific, the directing flawless, the cinematography is perfect and the characters are so lovable and hateable at the same time that you cant resist going back for more. It complements Part II in that it shows the dignity of the mafia, and Part II shows the cruelty. Maybe it is a little too good to be true, but it does show the more familiar side of the mafia with the murders during the baptism and the assassination attempt on Vito Corleone, beautifully played by Marlon Brando. It also shows the down hill road of Michael corleone, who goes from a respectable war hero to a ruthless sociopath. The corleone family is like the roman empire. The godfather is a masterpiece and is hard to dislike.",positive
"the trilogy (or rather the 1st 2 movies) are my best ever, period!",positive
One of my favorites.,positive
The best gangster movie of all times!!!,positive
"I would like to give this movie 10 out of 5 stars, more than perfect, a classic :-)",positive
It takes a few viewings to 'get it' ... at least for me.,positive
"An absolutely brilliant film. It might be a chore to watch because of it's length, but when you get past that, it's simply brilliant.",positive
"I wonder whether 'The Godfather' or the Mafia itself has had a bigger cultural impact on the world. Forever holding its own amidst the cinematic elite, perhaps the greatest accolade earned by the film was uttered by crime boss Salvatore Gravano, who recognized his own experiences amidst the artistry. A number of films achieve effortless acclaim and 'The Godfather' stands gargantuan amidst its cinematic lessers and even in the company of the privileged few that can hold any comparison. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), head of the Corleone crime family possessed of immense economic and political influence; considered 'Godfather' amongst relative innocent and rival family alike. In spite of his occasional lapses into questionable morality, Don Vito's refusal to enter into a potential heroin deal funded by the Tattaglia family provokes a gang warfare of immense proportions. Through a series of twisting events, eldest son Sonny (James Caan), Consigliere Tom (Robert Duvall) and Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) find their and the family's fortunes lie with college-educated, decorated war-hero and youngest son Michael (Al Pacino). At three hours in length, Francis Ford Coppola decided to paint the Sistine Chapel instead of the Mona Lisa. Working alongside Mario Puzo; author of the original text, 'The Godfather' never falters in an evenly-paced unravelling of the web of intrigue cast over a near-pedantically detailed plot. For a film of such scale, the importance of character development is never neglected and stays firmly at the heart of everything. Regarding cast, a comparison can be drawn to Shakespearean works and 'The Canterbury Tales' in the sheer number and variety of characters comprising a cast whose only rival can only truly stand as 'The Lord of the Rings'. Similarly, Coppola's scripting and direction prevent the names on display from ever feeling overwhelming or overdone. Al Pacino delivers comfortably the finest performance of his career, easily holding attention and providing the essence of 'The Godfather's' artistry and appeal. Whereas Al Pacino's performance holds attention, Marlon Brando draws it, carrying an air of power which simply exudes from every movement and rasp. It does not seem unreasonable to consider the influence of Brando's performance on the eventual over-machoness that would become Pacino's trademark, only without the quiet aura always managed by De Niro and Brando's equally terrifying and admirable Godfather. Perhaps underrated, or at least comparatively ignored in the wake of 'The Godfather's' many majesties is the cinematography. The scale of shot stays within a relatively simple and uncomplicated range of sizes, yet the proficiency of this tactic in combination with a variety of warm, colour-saturated scenes and muted darkness of the under-world results in a stunning display of understated artistry. The warmth and comfort of Mediterranean Sicilian hillside descends into cold threat with startling ease, as all the while the sun never descends. For the less character-development-inclined, Coppola never fails to shy away from a shoot-out, delivered in gritty and personal details utilizing fully both acting talent and stunning, chilling musical score by Nino Rota to never let the masterpiece's personality and personalities play second fiddle to mere fire-fights. For the deeper, Coppola's juxtaposition of Vito Corleone's one-sided offers with undeniable honour and family orientation of the Corleone family forces the audience to question the sympathies and understanding of events, especially regarding the role and development of Michael. Cult followings seem to spring up without pattern and sometimes without justification, yet here, Coppola and his cast's performances provide more than enough material for pub-worthy debate. The New Zealand Rugby Union team forms the basis for my final analogy of 'The Godfather'. Although the All Blacks' World Cup victories will never match their undeniable ability, none could hold any weakness of them. 'The Godfather' may not be recognized by the AFI as the Best Film ever ('Citizen Kane' holding that particular accolade), or even mine outright, 'The Godfather' contains not a single weakness in its mastery of the fundamentals and with its basis assured, truly adds the final flourishes to a work of art that veers between gritty realism and elevated questioning, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando as the standout stars in a burning constellation and an experience that will simply never leave. Nor would anyone want it to.",positive
Overrated. But pretty good set design there. And memorable scenes.,negative
Its True That If Your Not A Fan Its Rather Boring. But Once You Get Into The Godfather Youd Be Suprised That Its A True Mafia Classic With Fantastic Actors.,positive
"Saying that The Godfather is a landmark in movies is a massive understatement to say the least. It's often considered the greatest film of all-time, and for good reason. Coppola's fierce, angry, violent mob movie is a classic. It's filled with one of the greatest casts assembled ever, with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and James Caan providing powerhouse perfromances. The writing is intelligent and charasmatic throughout the giant duration of almost three hours, and your eyes will be firmly glued to the screen for the full duration. Many gangster movies have been made throughout the years, good and bad, but The Godfather is definitely the example of a great gangster movie. The story is as absorbing and attractive as it the cinematography or even the comedic moments which provide the unique balance between serious and hilarious. Each scene is as memorable as the last, and even if you haven't seen the movie you will recognise a strong percentage of the movie directly from all the homages made to it over the years. If i were to say this was a masterpiece, i'd be correct.",positive
Restored to its former glory in high-def. I'm not convinced a lot really happens in this film plot-wise - mafia stories never grabbed me - but it's beautifully shot and acted.,negative
"Every gangster movie in history will have to live up to this masterpiece. It sets new ground for American film and brings more to the table than most mafia movies I've seen. From the Don Corleone's daughter's wedding to dissagreements in business, to the traitors and reuniting of families. The plots twist and connect throughout the script. A man promised a mission to carry out one day finally gets an opportunity. A son that never wanted to join the family business ends up doing a dirty job for vengeance and becomes a leader once the Don grows older. This is a classic tale of mafia life and unlike other films of this nature it isn't filled with profanities every 5 minutes and it has the authenticity and element of surprise although when something climactic is about to happen it is beautifully captured by Coppola. The emotions of the characters and their defining characteristics show in the film and to precision with the exception of most of the female cast. The Godfather is brilliantly acted by Pacino, Caan and Marlon Brando putting on very memorable performances. It does the mafia era justice and it is 3 hours of pure excellance. This is one movie that should not be overlooked and although it is graphic at times it shows the mafia lifestyle to the point where the audience feels like they are part of that history. It does stretch from time to time but always recovers wonderfully. The Godfather brings out the importance of family. Pacino says at one point don't ever take sides against your family. Being Italian myself this movie is my family and it made me an offer I can't refuse. (So many quotable lines) I reccomend to anyone who hasn't seen it.",positive
"A hugely disappointing flop of a film... The events that gradually unfold lack realism, characters lack depth and the direction and camera work is poor to say the least. I just feel that every aspect of this movie leaves a lot more to be desired. One can only imagine the distress of the film crew, watching the final edit after arduous months of post-production; a slow realisation perhaps, that millions of dollars and valuable time had been wasted on such a mindnumbingly awful movie.",negative

"When one thinks of the perfect film; one with no flaws and is nothing short of a masterpiece, very few falls into this category. This film is coupled with immaculate acting, flawless plot. I am talking (typing) about The Godfather of course. The Godfather is the ultimate film, only those who are less learned would disagree when this is said to be one of the, if not the greatest film ever created in all of mankind's history. Well maybe I got a little carried away, or was I? This film follows a Sicilian family living in America, who a running an organised crime syndicate run by who they call the 'Godfather', which is played by Marlon Brando who gives an unforgettable performance. Brando even goes as far as putting cotton wool into his mouth to get the performance wanted by the writer, which the book is based upon. Written and Co-Written by Francis Ford Coppola (Director) and Mario Puzo (Book Writer). The family undergo many things, such as murder and corruption. WARNING: THIS SEGMENT MAY REVEAL MAJOR PLOT POINTS It starts off with the day of the Godfathers daughter's wedding. The Godfather does request given to him, as it is his policy to grant the request of the people who ask on his daughter's wedding day. The film later progresses to an in-depth look on the family, which includes three sons of The Godfather, following the attempt assassination of their father: Vito Corleone (The Godfather). The eldest son Santino (James Caan) is a trigger happy wild-fire, which is the muscle of the siblings and the heir to his father's place. His violent ways soon lead to his demise as a reckless Godfather. The middle son Fredo (John Cazale) is the weakest of children, shown especially by how he drops his gun while his father is being assassinated. He is also passed for the Godfather role, by his younger brother Michael. Fredo is seen at minimal amount in this film, yet is a main character in the sequel. Michael (Al Pacino) is the youngest of the siblings, and is at first reluctant to join the 'family' business, but later commits himself after another attempt is made upon his father to kill him, while he is left unguarded in the hospital. Al Pacino does great as Michael and in my opinion deserved the Academy Award for best actor. He takes over as the Godfather when Vito semi-retires and Santino is dead, bypassing Fredo for the position. Other honourable mentions would have to go to Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) who plays as the lawyer for the family, as well as an adopted brother and son to the family. He plays excellently and is very helpful towards the plot and should be highly commended for his role. This film is nothing more than pure genius; it has my two favourite scenes of all time. My favourite is during Connies (Talia Shire: Michael, Fredo and Santino's sister, whom also did an awesome job) son's baptism service, when Michael does his part as the Godfather of the child, and the assassinations of his enemies take place. My second favourite scene would have to be the very end, after Michael has Connie's husband, Carlo, who beat her often and was once beaten by Santino for doing so, but then did so again so Santino would be an easy target, after Santino leaves protection to find him, leading to his demise at another great scene at the tollbooth. Anyway, after Connie finds out about this she confronts Michael in his office in front of his wife, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) and when she leaves his office Kay asks him if it was true. Michael lies to her saying that he didn't do so, implying that he didn't physically kill him himself, which Kay doesn't realise, when she leaves she looks back into his door where Michael is being 'honoured' by Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) and others, and another closes the door while she watches in despair. While Brando was great here is how things should have gone, best Actor in leading role: Al Pacino -- he is not a supporting actor, but a lead actor. Best Supporting actor: James Caan, possibly Robert Duvall. Best Director: Francis Ford Coppola. Best original score: Love Theme from Godfather, was said to be plagiarised and that is why it didn't win, but it won the Oscar when played in part two. It already won best picture and best adapted screenplay though. Overall this film is immaculate in all possible ways, some might say it's boring, but when one listens to what they are saying and follows the plot... I find it hard to get bored, the film is nothing short of pure genius and in my opinion is the greatest film ever, and I am not the only one who believes so either.",positive

The reason I put off watching it was I feared I would be disappointed, and I was. The storyline is pretty good but some of the ""fights"" are really poorly done. Some scene transitions really felt like they were missing a Batman transition. Thinking about it the fights could probably have done with Biff Bop Pow popping up. Overall the film isn't too bad, I just really don't know why it's quite so highly revered.",negative
One of the best films ever.,positive
The best of all time!!,positive
"What a awesome movie, can't believe I waited this long to watch it, man it was long though, but not slow and all the great actors when they were younger, wow",positive
"Because this movie has Extraordinary performances, amazing direction, incredible screenplay, and an excellent soundtrack, it's more than good, more than great, it's perfection in every way. When I first saw this movie, I was 10 years old, and I couldn't stand it, and now I love it, so be patient, watch this movie and observe every detail, that will make it unforgettable. Vito Corleone(Brando) is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael(Pacino) has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Tania Shire, Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi(Russo). All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo(Lettieri) is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen(Duvall), the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Sonny(Caan) to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart. Everybody says that the movie gets everything right, and it's true. This movie follows a narrative rhythm that is impeccable, it never slows down too much, and that's because the whole movie is slow. And in some tense scenes (Like the scene where Michael is changing his father's room in the hospital), and even some funny ones (When Michael is in Sicily talking to a man about that girl that he met, and the guy finds out that she's his daughter), it's done with excellency. The screenplay is one of the best ever made. It develops it's character so well, that almost everyone is learning something during the story. And of course, it gives us memorable quotes like the classic ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!"" or ""I'm a superstitious man!"". The Soundtrack by Nino Rota is brilliant, and you can notice that right in the first scene. The acting is equally impressing, even Pacino that don't usually blows my mind like everyone says (Not that he is a bad actor, he's excellent, but I prefer contained and calm performances), impressed me a lot, he's so cold and looks so smart that make his turns believable and intelligent. Brando gives one the best performances the world has ever seen, and considering that he was 48 when this movie was released, he convinced me that he was a sick, old man (Which Pacino didn't do that well in ""The Godfather: Part III""). And observe the scene where Hagen tells him about Sonny, and you'll see what I mean by saying that it's one of the best of all time. Verdict: A lot of people, including me, say that it's the best movie ever made, so they probably have a good reason to say that.",positive
i can change my mind,positive
"The Godfather seems to have this intimidation factor about it. Like all great cinema, people who have never seen it don't hold as much interest. It appears ""too big"" for some (that's what she said), and too ""great"" for others. More pessimistic film fans will call the film overrated based on it's legendary status. Now, where do I stand on this film? Shut up and see it already. That's what I say The Godfather is a classic for a reason and that reason is clear to see when you actually watch the film. Upon first viewing, I found the first part to be a little dense, but it eventually sucked me in. Now, whenever I revisit it, I'm totally blown away every time. It's such an intricate, emotional, intense picture. An absolute landmark in cinematic history.",positive
"Very few films get everything right, but ""The Godfather"" is one of them. It's pure art! The acting, writing, cinematography, music and all the other technical elements (under the direction of Mr. Coppola) come together so effectively; making this film a masterpiece.",positive
Geatest movie of all time.,positive
Francis Ford Coppola really did a good job on it.,positive
Tied with Scarface as my favorite gangster movie! absolutely love it. got hooked within the first 5.,positive
"I find the almost cultist reverence for this film fascinating. I'm sure that lots of people who nominate it as their favourite film do so simply because that's so expected, and not for the emotional impact of it. In it's defense - it is perfect in almost every way: mise-en-scene, production, casting, acting, editing, music. It has been extraordinarily influential. It really creates its own world - it's often hypnotic, and sometimes exciting, with superb dialogue, well-paced narrative AND some great character relationships. AND it has one of the most powerful closing shots in cinema history. Yet. For me... It carries an aloofness, a coolness that never lets me connect with the characters 100%. It's very much an ""outside-looking-in"" film. It only has one (barely-developed) female character. It's very much about men's men whipping out rulers to prove who is longer and stronger. It's very much about violent men who have disassociated from society and formed their own cultish ""family"" which feeds and breeds off the torment of others - fascinating stuff like I said - but I found minimal sympathetic connection for them. If you disconnect your emotions and watch this with pure intellect, sure you might appreciate it's vaunted position on the top of many best of lists. But if you want to connect both intellectually AND emotionally to a dysfunctional family: stick with ""The Simpsons"". At least everyone can relate to them.",positive
Amazing. Boring at times but I made up for by plot,positive
"The best there ever was, is and ever will be!",positive
"Good movie, but I did not think it was the best ever by a long shot. It could be that I am watching it by today's standards, and not by the standards of the early 70s, but I just did not think that it was that impressive. Now I gave it a 90% because it was definitely good, but I just did not enjoy it as much as I expected to.",positive
"The more one learns about cinema as an art, the more one begins to appreciate The Godfather. Whatever random series of events that led to the creation of this masterpiece of American cinema may never happen again. From the difficulty in casting a suitable Michael to the legal troubles of Mario Puzo and the supposed likeness between his character Johnny Fontaine and Frank Sinatra, this film could have turned out very differently. The genius of the film is self-evident even in the very opening shot as a typical Italian-American businessman tells the horrific story of his daughter's beating at the hands of two young ""non-Italians"". From the very beginning we are told the kind of business Mr. Corleone is in, as well as the plight and mindset of the average Italian-American that will play a major part in the coming events. The Godfather plays host to a wonderful cast of actors that need not be praised any more than they have already. With Marlon Brando playing perhaps his greatest role as one of cinema's most popular and enigmatic characters, Vito Corleone. The Don Corleone's great appeal as a cinematic character is the general awe at his political strength and respect while we understand very little about how he rose to power (and issue more directly addressed in the sequel). Also with Al Pacino in his breakout role as Vito's son Michael we are spoiled for acting talent, not to mention John Cazale as the slightly off-key Fredo, Robert Duvall as the balanced family lawyer Tom Hagen, James Caan as the hot-headed Sonny and Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend Kay. The most potent themes in this film are family and capitalism, and they are interlinked quite definitely. The issue of business over family arises regularly and at times become so inseperable that it is difficult to gauge the impressions of the characters who make the decisions. For example Sonny's reckless behaviour in response to the death of his father, as everyone acknowledges is ""bad for business"" yet his family duty forces him to place one over the other. But this approaches yet another theme which is ""vendetta"". As Michael walks through the Sicilian village of Corleone he asks ""where are all the men?"" to which his bodyguard replies ""all dead from vendettas"". Of course revenge crops up repeatedly most notably in the death of Sonny and the death of Carlos towards the end of the film. These vendettas begin a cycle of violence, pain and deception that permeate through Michael's relationships with his wife and sister that will have disastrous consequences in the future. Of course Michael's change from the straight army veteran we see at Connie's wedding to the man we see lying directly to Kay at the end makes him seem almost like two different people. His transformation is one of Francis Ford Coppolla's greatest cinematic achievements. Michael is dressed in army attire in the beginning of the film. This is his US persona. At this point he has bought into the American lifestyle and is convinced that life can be led legally and happily. However once he becomes disillusioned with this view of reality he begins to rediscover his roots in Sicily; he marries Sicily. He begins to subconsciously reject the ideas of legality, or perhaps his conversation with Kay about turning the Corleone family legal in five years was merely fodder to which he knew the American woman would only respond; she wouldn't understand a conscious continuation of illegal acitivies. Also, the power contrast between the scene at the wedding where Michael pulls Kay into the family portrait becomes painful ironic as the door closes on her in the climactic image. Michael's full conversion from American citizen to Italian-American mob boss comes in the famous ""Baptism of blood"" montage. Coppola here creates a sequence that is cinematically flawless as the images cut from the priest's hands to the hands of Michael's gunman, from the priest dabbing holy water on the baby's chin to the barber rubbing shaving cream on the target's face, from brow wiping gunman to brow wiping gunman. The sound of the church, the organ and the baptism flows over the entire sequence ending in a crescendo at ""Michael, do you reject Satan?"", cue Clemenza shooting three men in a doorway with a shotgun. The lie of Capitalism is a major issue that is not only a part of Michael's transformation but is a major over-arching issue that deals entirely with the issue of organised crime. In many ways, the Corleone family cannot even be considered to be objectively immoral. Vito advocate justice. He will not kill the perpetrators of the crime against the funeral home director's daughter, but agrees to show them the same treatment they doled out, whereas the US ""justice"" system reaches unsatisfactory conclusions. The Corleones only deal with gambling and women but not narcotics. And the police force and politicians are okay with this. The real criminal is the police Captain McCluskey and the gangster Sollozzo who deal in narcotics; profit at any cost. Yet all these factors are crucial in the workings of a capitalist society, even today. The Godfather gives quite an accurate impression of how money is made and shows that in fact the elected officials are not the ones who are in charge. The Corleone family could quite easily have been considered a ""legal"" business and still taken part in many of the activities that it did. The Godfather is a truly spectacular film that never seems to age, and as an avid watcher of film travels back through the films that inspired Copolla and his contemporaries it becomes possible to truly appreciate the compelixity and wonder of this film. I couldn't even begin to say all there is to be said about this film, but can only hope that people will appreciate the film for what it is rather than then individual events that occur",positive

I saw it but I never liked it. Too evil for me.,positive
"In my opinion, the greatest movie of all time. You cannot get closer to movie perfection than The Godfather, and hopefully nobody ever will. When I watch the film I still find it amazing how a 70's film grips me more than a modern day multi million dollar project. The acting is phenomenal, the script is fantastic and the story line is genius. There's something about Marlon Brando. His acting never fails to amaze me. He brings something to the role of the 'Godfather' which no other actor in the world could've done. It was almost as if the role was made for him. His performance is so natural and believable and although there were many brilliant acting performances in the film, Marlon Brando's 'Godfather' is in a league of it's own. Although the film follows the lives of many people in the Corleone family, the film circles around the life of Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino. I remember when I first watched The Godfather. It was about a week and a half after watching Scarface. I was staggered as to how Al Pacino could play two completely different characters perfectly. He is almost the rebel of the Corleone family if you like. The one who doesn't want anything to do with family business, however as drama unfolds he is forced to help his family out. I know people who have said that they will not like The Godfather and after seeing it for the first time they are left speechless. A fantastic film that builds up to a brilliant ending which leaves you wanting more.",positive
There should be more than 5 stars for this film!!!!,positive
one of my all time faves,positive
The Greatest Film of All time Terrific Performance By Marlon Brando and The Best Cast A Film Need with Excellent Screenplay and Direction. The Godfather is a Must Watch Film for any generation,positive

"One of the most influential crime dramas in cinema history, <i>The Godfather</i> is a magnificent scope of epic storytelling by Francis Ford Coppola. Scene for scene, the film does not let up providing consistent detail on it's characters and storyline. Marlon Brando performs amazingly as Don Corleone, head of the Corleone family and current Godfather, until his attempted assasination by the hands of a mafia rival. Immediately after, eldest son Sonny (James Caan) goes on a hot-headed frenzy for justice. Around that time, the youngest son in Michael (Al Pacino) comes back to the household, demanding retribution and volunteering for the role of hitman, much to the dismay of his brothers. The successful killing of Don Corleone's attempted gunmen, has Michael flown off to another country until the heat of his actions clear up. Everything goes according to plan until more complications arise, which has Michael flown back to the states to take up his place as the true Godfather. Al Pacino delivers one of his greatest roles to date and shaped up his skills as the infamous actor he now is. After his critically acclaimed performance in <i>The Panic in Needle Park</i>, Coppola saw promise in Pacino to cast him as the future Godfather. His assumption worked out brilliantly and Pacino took the part to another level. <i>The Godfather</i> is exactly like it's dialogue entails, ""An offer you can't refuse"".",positive
"An extremely solid film that suffers from being a bit overlong. However, I will say that I was very surprised with this movie; I didn't think I would like it at all. The movie is only about a crime syndicate on the surface, it's actually a father-son story. It shows how the sins of the father affect the son. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give the performances of a lifetime. Cinematography is solid, although not flashy, and the film has some genuinely surprising moments. Only downside is that it feels a bit overly drawn out in spots.",positive
"The high standard for all mafia movie afterward.. impressive story line and beautiful picture.. Love Al Pacino, James Caan, Marlon Brando, Castellano... ah, epic!",positive
"One of, if not THE most iconic mob/gangster movies out there. A huge chunk of this film has some of the most memorable acted, quotable scenes and characters in the history of cinema.

"Ok I shouldve watched this film many many many many many many many many many many many many years ago. Ive seen it now, and I was impressed but I dont really like Pal Puccino. How long did his black eye take to heal?? Its called the Godfather but hes only in it for about 5 minutes. So the time is shared between puccini, duvall and Shaka. Shaka is irratating but good, duvall is impressive too and puccino just pisses me off. Marlon Brando shouldve asked for more lines. Too late now though.... Does Rocky know Adrian is from a Mafia family?",positive

"<i>Te faccio un'offerta che non puoi rifiutare...</i> Una tragedia ambigua da un romanzo di Puzo, che ha girato l'America e la Sicilia nella sua ricerca sulle origini sulla mafia. Tragica e impeccabile. Il film di Coppola non Ã¨ un esempio di tecnica particolare, ma Ã¨ questo il suo grande vantaggio: la sua classicitÃ , nel modo in cui Ã¨ orchestrata, con la sua atmosfera cosÃ¬ riconoscibile da qualsiasi italiano, con i suoi dialoghi in dialetto siculo-napoletano Ã¨ assolutamente irresistibile. Un ritratto dell'incubo americano ineccepibile, una suntuosa scenografia ricreata alla perfezione (da New York alle ville californiane a una Las Vegas cupa come non mai fino ad una Sicilia che sembra uscita da una tela anonima di qualche artista di campagna nella parte piÃ¹ poetica e spettacolare della pellicola), un'addentrarsi nei percorsi del potere, della ricchezza e della mafia mai cosÃ¬ dettagliato ed attori dal carisma unico. E poi la regia, il capolavoro classico di Coppola: la sua perfezione nel legare saldamente narrazione e aspetto tecnico lo rende uno dei film piÃ¹ autoriali e piÃ¹ poetici degli ultimi vent'anni. Non Ã¨ necessario come ""Apocalypse Now"", ma Ã¨ uno dei mattoni fondanti del Cinema Americano, un ""kolossal di camera"" in costume assolutamente trascinante proprio per la sua magistrale classicitÃ . Un film che riesce a ricreare un ambiente crudele, ambiguo e negativo senza cadere nella retorica ma senza neppure fare apparire come eroi i protagonisti. Chi avrebbe scommesso su di lui prima di fare questo film, aveva dietro solo poche esperienze di puro cinema indipendente o quasi. Eppure Ã¨ riuscito a dare fiducia ad una grande produzione, scavalcando ostacoli impensabili (la guerra di Sinatra non Ã¨ stato un caso isolato), mettendo insieme un cast da urlo, con Marlon Brando ed una infinita processioni di nomi che hanno fatto la storia del grande cinema americano dagli anni '70 in poi. Buonasera... buonasera"". E Marlon, con quella sua faccia squadrata e inconfondibile, fa eccitare, sorridere dall'estasi e piangere durante quell'ultimo gioco con il suo nipotino... ti piange il cuore, ci rimani di stucco. Interpretazione superlativa, immedesimazione impressionante. Baciamo le mani... secondo me Rota doveva vincere anche qui l'Oscar...",positive
Might be the best movie of all time,positive
"Its the 1970s and movies are taking a turn for the next generation and some of the best directors of all time are starting to make their marks. Enter Francis Ford Coppolla and a stream then unknown stars whose careers were shot into superstardom with The Godfather. Organized crime is on the rise and you are placed in the center of the deals, assassinations and double crosses. Coppolla stages assassinations as if he wanted to actually do it in real life. The depiction of the seemingly innocent neighborhood being absolutely assaulted with beatings and bullets, shows that no one and nowhere is safe. Marlon Brando turns in his most memorable performance struggling with the aspect of his business and his family. Al Pacino also turns in a riveting performance as Brando's son who is trying to live a normal life and is reluctant to take over the family business. Watching Pacino's character slowly change sides is harrowing and true to the events that happen in his life. The supporting cast is also memorable as well, even the one's who aren't official family are treated like sons. This is a film about loyalty and what being a man is truly like. At 3 hours, The Godfather sometimes struggles to keep your attention and the climax kind of waivers between interest and boredom. Other times, it is hard to keep track of all of the characters and some may get frustrated at the fact that we must follow everyone around for 3 hours. But the very ending is picture perfect, the action scenes are bloody and memorable and it is easy to see why this really changed the way that crime was made. The Godfather is a very good film, with great performances and is not about the killings or the crime, but it shifts between the essence of masculinity and finding out where your true loyalties lie. SEE IT",positive
A timeless tale by Coppola and Pacino's best performance. A must for all mafia lovers.,positive

"Entertaining, yes! The best movie of all time, definitely NOT! As good as ""Schindler's List,"" ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" and a thousand lesser flicks, no, no no.

"""I Believe In America"" Then It All Begins. The Godfather in my eyes is the greatest motion picture of all time. The first time I seen this it was my favourite and it has never not been the best in my opinion. The casting is absolutely perfect, Marlon Brando gives one of his best or maybe even his best performance of all time as The Godfather Vito Corleone. Al Pacino plays the part of Michael excellant aswell, I think Part II is the one where he steals the show but nevertheless this performance but him on the road to stardom. The plot is very realistic and based on the real life five families and tries to show you have mafia families operate with different levels of authority and respect which had never been done before, Well at least I don't think. The Godfather will always be remembered and will always be on the top 100 of all time lists, Always in the top 5 and that is for a reason. Everything is perfect and there aren't very many films you can say that about: The characters, dialogue, the score, screenplay. Amazing!",positive

"Ahhh, what to say. Every up-and-coming actor should take notes here. Brando brilliantly portrays the aging and sorrowful, dying Don Vito. Al Pacino and James Caan play his son's and the legendary Robert Duvall plays Tom Hagen. And they all blow it outta the water. The Godfather is more than anything, a moving piece of artwork. The pacing is so delicately timed that nothing drags, and nothing happens too fast. The directing is in a league of it's own. It seems to be carved out of diamonds and displayed for all to see, and there's not a bad shot in the movie. Francis Ford Coppola created a god amongst movies with his adaptation of an already great novel ""The Godfather"" by Mario Puzo. It's perfection all the way down to it's core. There's nothing overblown, no dragging scenes, not a bad actor in it. Okay, maybe nothing's perfect, but The Godfather is as close to perfection as movies come. The Godfather reigns supreme over some of the best movies ever made. Mario Puzo wrote the screenplay, giving the movie that blitzing sense of a serious reality created in his book. Still, after 40 years, the public is still singing it's praises. It also really got the ball rolling on future gangster films. Whether it be Miller's Crossing, Goodfellas, Bugsy, or even it's own sequels, The Godfather is the 'Don' of them all. Now, I, myself, am making everyone ""An offer you can't refuse"". And that offer is to watch this movie, and if you CAN actually refuse it, than I'm dreadfully sorry for you.",positive

"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels. The most widely and worldwide beloved and respected american movie of all time, THE GODFATHER. i may have seen it when i was young but i forgot everything about it and decided to see it now. and what a time i had. truly memorable and unforgettable masterpiece it is. a classic movie. one of the best movies of all time. one of my all time favorites. the best mafia gangster movie ever. the best trilogy ever. currently 2nd place in the IMDB TOP 250 movies ranking, a Rotten Tomatoes score of 100%. one of the best Oscar winning movie ever. nominated for a total 11 Oscars but then the Best Score nomination was labeled withdrawn or ineligible due to being reused from another movie. but a total 10 Nominations and winning 3.

Screenplay was well done, superb. admirable work. superb story and wonderful plot. i am not one of those people who complain about this movie being really long, slow moving and boring. i don't overrate stuff, i say what i feel.to be honest i wasn't bored at all while watching this movie. in fact i loved it, when it was finished i wanted more, well i'll be watching the other two soon. this movie was like an wonderful encyclopedia about this Italian big mafia family and i wanted to know and see more about them that is the kind of feeling you don't get anymore. i loved the slow moving just talking plot, that is what makes it a classic. i love it the way it is and this is the way it should be. superb story and a likable plot. i was glued to the screen and was attentive the whole time. talking about the performances, wow man. there could not have been any better Don Vito Corleone than the Best Actor ever, the legend itself, Mr Marlon Brando. what a marvelous, spectacular, classic astonishing performance he gave. i wish he was there for the every Godfather movie. his dialogues delivery, his expressions, his everything his attitude was just unforgettable. wow such an excellent performance ever. superb work. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was the best supporting actor to me, he did an excellent job. he was really good. James Caan as Sonny Corleone was good too and so was Robert Duvall as Tom Hegan. other actors include John Cazale, Diane Keaton , Sterling Hayden , Richard Conte , Talia Shire , Al Lettieri , Al Martino , Lenny Montana , Rudy Bond , Richard Bright , Richard S. Castellano , Franco Citti , Corrado Gaipa , Tony Giorgio , Julie Gregg , Angelo Infanti and others. superb supporting cast and a one big alone one that was so powerful that it is beyond words to describe his performance. this movie had good dialogues, nice background score and soundtracks. i liked the editing too, nice work by them. superb cinematography and art direction along with the costumes direction. yes there is violent scenes, action and shooting scenes are less and i like it. not nowadays where you see alot of action and less good writing. they do it to cover the bad written work up. but not here. but there were good amounts of them you see people getting shot and killed in violent ways. there were some really classic scenes which are so memorable to be honest. this movie is tragic too. and an epic story about a family. i don't even have to say this i think but this is a MUST WATCH.",positive

"Wanted to see it for so long, heard so many good things about it. And it delivers on all of them. The movie was very long, about 3 hours, but it goes by fast. There is a lot to follow in the plot and the movie keeps you on your toes to follow the story. The acting is also great, Pacino is amazing as is Brando, the rest of the star studded cast follow suit. Franciis Ford Coppola delivers the ""godfather"" of all mobster movies, everyone should see this movie. It is a classic.",positive
One of the best movies of all time,positive

"Yesterday evening, i was lucky enough to finally discover for the first time on screen, the masterpiece of all gangster films: The Godfather. Nothing i have ever seen can compare to the grandeur of such a film. Orchestrated masterfully, this family saga is simply a masterpiece on every level. From the actors direction, to the lighting, the costumes, the locations, the dialogues and the unforgettable soundtrack, the film deserves all the praise & fame surrounding it. I have seen many films in my life but only now, at 31 years old, can i understand why The Godfather will forever be a cult classic movie. It's simply marvelous. 'Leave the gun, take the Cannoli'",positive
"""The Godfather ""is purely amazing. I watched this film for the first time recently and I have always heard great things about it but I have avoided it because I thought it was too old and simply was not the style of film that I would enjoy. I have found that this film and its characters to form bonds that make the viewer feel that they are a part of their lives especially Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) whose method acting style creates a great relationship with this character.The characters, the plot, the twists and most everything else in this film were astounding. I was introduced to Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront"" and respected him as an actor but now I feel like I know him as the ""Godfather"" and would love for him to be mine. I really enjoyed his famous quote ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"". This quote shows how persuasive he can be and his intelligence in this style of business. He may be a great mod leader but during the scenes with his grandson it can be viewed that he is very loving and caring of his family. I also enjoyed watching his son Michael grow into the family business and become the new Don. He seemed to be more aggressive than his father and I do not respect him as much but the scene with the cop and the head of the family when he kills them is one of the greatest scenes I have ever seen. I cannot wait to watch the part II of the series which I have heard is about how Don Vito Corleone got into the business.",positive
"This is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Not only did I walk away contemplating the storyline of The Godfather II, but also wishing I possessed that style of presenting myself. The serious, dressed up look was very compelling. One aspect that I enjoyed the most was the theme music. At times, it had an eerie carnival ride tone to it, and that usually led into a main idea or climax of a scene. Multiple times, I considered putting that music on my MP3 player...it was that good. The acting was also superb. Right off the bat, I was impressed with Marlon Brando's character, Don Coreleone. He had a serious and respectable attitude, which came across as quite remarkable for the viewer due to that low, raspy voice of his. No doubt I'll be using that voice the next time some telemarketer calls. ""I'm a very reasonable man, what price, eh..., do yuh intend to offer?"" The Godfather's cinematography and lighting easily stands out to be the best in the film industry. It didn't rely on computer graphics and cheesy special effects to get their point across, but rather pure acting, lighting and camera shots. The lighting, in particular during the conference room scenes, had an eerie aurora to it, casted only on the person talking, usually heavily focused on their forehead with the background heavily contrasted behind them. The eyes had dark circles around them, giving it a really creepy look to the character. The film pulled it off with absolute perfection. I'm not usually one for analyzing endings, but this film left off with a perfect transition to a second movie. ""Welcome back, Don Coreleone."" And with that came the transfer of power from father to son. I give this film a 100% Tomato Rating.",positive
"The Godfather The Godfather is a terrific movie, but in order to know what is going on, it is crucial that the viewer does not miss a second of the film. If that is the case the viewer will be completely lost. The characters in this film are very distinct and extremely important to know. The Godfather is Don Vito Corleone the head of one of the five mobster leaders. He has three sons that are important to know; Sonny, Fredo, and Michael. Sonny is the son that is the first hair to take over his father's duties; he is aggressive and hot headed. This could get him into some trouble. Fredo is the son that does the dirty work that Sonny does not want to do. The youngest son Michael is the college boy; he is the only person in the family besides the women that is not involved in the family business. This film is quite graphic and violent. Many people will end up dyeing because of the conflict that will arise in the film. Morals and beliefs are interesting to keep track of, even though the Corleone's are involved in organized crime does not necessarily mean that they are bad people. It would be a wise choice to go onto imdb.com and look over the character list, so that the viewer in already informed on whom the characters are, because the film throws a lot at the audience at once. So to avoid being overwhelmed become familiar with the actors in the film.",positive
"The Godfather was a good film in my opinion. Family is the number one thing in this film. If you were into films that deal with protecting your family and having people by your side then this is the film that you should watch! Don Corleone is the ""Godfather"" in the film and he will do whatever you ask but then you will need to repay him with a job. He has a long term family business and it involves the other five families. But Corleone talks about how he doesn't want his youngest son Michael to get involved in the family business, he wished that Michael would become a governor or such. But the part I don't get is why giving the job to Michael, the youngest son, instead of the other son Fredo Corleone? Is it because Michael proved that he was worthwhile? But I guess in the end its better that Michael got it because he wants to change the way the business is. The only reason Michael is in the business is because he took the responsibilities of killing Capt. McCluskey and Sollozo. Right after he shot the both of them in the head he immediately was in the family business. But the dream of making the family business better is better than shooting people and creating a new war.",negative
"I think The Godfather was a very good film. I like the action a lot; it never got boring. It was pretty easy to follow and the actors played their roles perfectly. The way they talked really made me think of the mafia and etc which made each character better. A lot of scenes I did not see coming, so that through me off a little bit, which also made me think about what was really going to happen next. This film got pretty intense and kept me on the edge of my seat. The story does not feel like it is completely over, so I want to see the other Godfathers as well. This was by far one of my favorite films we have watched in film class.",positive
The Godfather was created in the year 1972. The movie took the side of the Corleones family which was one of the five mafia groups. This movie took on a different perspective than most movies.,positive
"The Godfather is an AMAZING film! It is by far one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is superb, the filming style is unique and gives you a cool view into the world of the Corleone's, and the film leaves you breathless. The ending scene is one of the greatest parts of the movie. You do not see it coming at all and it really shows Michael at his true potential. It makes you fear him yet respect him; it's a whole new side to Michael. I really enjoyed Marlon Brando's acting in this film. He does a great job with method acting and truly becomes The Godfather. Brando gives Don Vito Corleone his own style of speech that everyone recognizes as the Don, even if they haven't seen the film. I have even seen an episode of Hannah Montana where her brother impersonates the Don in the opening scene. They even add the cheeks and lap cat! All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed The Godfather, it is a great classic that you can watch over and over and still pick up on something new that you did not see the previous time.",positive
I think it was a good movie that was good directed and had good actors. The whole story was good with how Don Vito didn't want Michael to be the Don but his brothers either couldn't handle it or got killed. The small details were also very good like if you missed some it wouldn't matter a lot but if you saw them it makes the movie better. It was also not really that much violence but when it was it was very brutal and you can't really see it coming,positive
"Precise and to the point, this movie is one of the best movies that I have seen. The storyline that is involved gets you on the good side of the bad guys to where it actually seems like you have joined them in their perils. Great movie, great plot, great actors, and over all amazing. A great way to escape from the good side and move over to the dark side for a while and have respect towards what they do for a living and have affective it is.",positive
"The godfather this movie was a very famous and successful movie in the world. It tells me that how a family influenced their children. Corleone family was from Italy, and it is a very powerful family. The godfather was a leader of a reactionary gang. But he was not bad. He always helping people get out of the trouble. He influence a lot people's life. Like his kids, his enemies, his friends. This movie also tells me that how godfather's kids loved him and respected him to changed their life or sacrifice their life. It is a family's honor. We have to change our mind or life when our family need us. That is contradictory, but you can't refuse it. Because that is the truth of life and a family. Family influenced you a lot.",positive
The Godfather was a very good movie. The main thing that made me really like this movie was how it was broken up into segments of calm talking to brutal killing. With having it broken up like that the audience gets neither overwhelmed nor bored. The one thing that I did not like was how you could tell what was going to happen before it actually did. Other than just that one thing I thought this movie was directed and shot very well and is a must see for everyone.,positive
"The godfather is the best movie ever made. The acting is completely authentic, and every scene grasps your attention. The godfather is the kind of movie that you cannot look away for a moment because if you do, you will lose an important part of the film. The acting is completely legitimate and believable. Every single actor who plays in this film seems to be a method actor because the acting is real. Marlon Brando one of my favorite actors of all time plays as ""The Godfather"", an Italian don named Vito Corleone whom controls one of the strongest family's in New York and Las Vegas. Al Pacino also is in film as one of the godfather's sons, he plays Michael Corleone, a college boy who goes off to war and becomes a hero. Every film after the godfather that was made, took at least one form of screen shot from that film.",positive
"After viewing The Godfather for the fourth time now, I still can honestly say that The Godfather is my favorite film of all time. Everything about this film I love, from the acting of antagonists and protagonists, all the way to the music. The acting throughout the film's entirety is very believable, even from the actors who didn't play a particularly large role in the story and especially the acting from Marlon Brando. His acting throughout the film, especially the first time I watched The Godfather, he really had me believing he was the head of a crime family, but even after viewing The Godfather multiple times, I still get the sense that he is the head of a crime family. There were two segments in particular that really grabbed my attention, and stick with me as my favorite scenes from The Godfather. The first segment is more like a series of scenes involving Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, in which I was in a trance because I desperately wanted to know what kind of crazy, mad man stunt he was going to try and pull against the Corleones. Not to mention Sollozzo is the first on-screen villain I have seen in a film that I really, really, hated. Within every inch of my body, I would have not liked anything better than see Sollozzo fail in his attempts against the Corleones. The other scene that really stuck with me is involving the new Don Corleone and the baptizing of Don Corleone's godson. It really stuck with me because of how much build up and how intense it was before the climax, and the ending sequence. I could spend forever talking about The Godfather and why I love it, why it is my favorite, and I really can see why The Godfather is considered either the greatest film of all time, or at least greatest American film (other than Citizen Kane), or at the very top of the film considered the greatest ever.",positive
"The Godfather is easily one of the best movies I have ever watched. It kept me on the edge of my seat trying to anticipate what was going to happen next, and that is what I believe makes a great movie. I also really liked how the roll of power changed throughout the movie from Don to the other families and then back to Dons son Michael. The acting was great and I enjoyed the way that the life of an Italian mobster was portrayed. I am looking forward to watching the second one and I hope that it turns out as well as this one has.",positive

Impossible not to love it,positive
"One of the most breathtaking and beautiful cinematice experiences you will ever witness with your own two eyes! One of the finest films ever created. This movie redefined cinema and the crime/mob genre. Francis Ford Coppola took the entrancing book by Mario Puzo and turned it into a film extravanganza! This film has so much in it, the cliche greek mythology combined with the seedy underbelly of New York and the glorification of the mafia and Italian Americans. Definately worth seeing!",positive
"A true masterpiece in every sense of the word, the Godfather gets everything right. Absolutely terrific acting from Brando to Pacino to Duval. One of the best films ever made.",positive
Just one great part to a really long story.,positive
Classic movie! Every movie lover must see this film if they haven't yet.,positive
Fantastic portrayals by Al Pacino and James Caan. Shooting at turnpike is my favorite scene.,positive
"This is as good as a crime drama could get. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are excellent, and the slow but dismal attitude that this movie portrays gives it that one-of-a-kind feel. There's simply nothing to compare it to.",positive
"The Year was 1972. The Vietnam War still had 2 more years before it was finally over, Star Wars was probably being written by George Lucas while he was prepping American Graffiti, Watergate was on American peoples minds, Russel Crowe was 8 years old and as for me...........well, i was not even a Glitch in my mothers Womb. That was the Year when a movie came out that was something Special, a movie that we still talk about today and even some might call the greatest film of all time. That was the year of The Godfather!!!!! Francis Ford Copolla directed one of the true cinema greats, and after almost 40 years, its still remains a fine example of a movie that sucks you in from beginning to end and leaves you satisfied like no other film like it. Marlon Brando 'makes you an offer you cant refuse' as Don Vito Corleone, the Head of his Family and Godfather. Brando is such a fine Actor and brings great weight to his role as the Don. Also great is James Caan as Sonny Corleone, the hot tempered son and Al Pacino as the young son Micheal Corleone, who at first does not want to get involved with the family Business until he has no choice. With other great actors like Robert Duvall and Dianne Keaton, the Godfather is a great ensemble that ended up winning a very deserving Best Picture at the Oscars and best Actor for Marlon Brando. Mario Puzo wrote the Screenplay, and its sizzling with Classic Lines and memorable moments. This film, like the old Cagney films before it, paved the way for some other great Gangster Flicks that came rolling along through the years after it, but this stands on the top of the Mountain as the Godfather of all them......",positive
"Possibly the greatest movie ever made. Francis Ford Coppola changed cinema history when he shown this piece of art, adapted into a movie from Mario Puzi best selling novel Coppola casted some of the best actors of our time, those included Al Pacino, the Great Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and James Caan and etc into this masterpiece. It created an influence in filmakers, certainly the best crime movie ever made. Epic is the word to use and will be remembered for as long as i can even imagine. Watched this on a big cinema screen, Its fantastic.",positive
"Like many tragic Greek stories before this film, the Godfather shows the story of a family who tried to be honest, yet was forced to do evil due to the intervention of fate.",positive

"One of the best movie's I've ever seen, along with Casablanca, this is a classic that I hope will never die out.",positive
"There's a reason this movie is epic. The plot is substantial, and never too complex. It's long, yes, but really worth the time you put into watching it. The characters are fully expressed, and the actors really bring them to life. I recommend that if you're gonna go watch this you need to spend the time and sit down to seriously watch it. This movie really is a must-see, i just don't know why i didn't go se it sooner.",positive
"This is a truly great film it's a cinemat- you know what forget about it, Everything I'll be writing is everything you've heard about the movie already just watch it if you haven't already.",positive

"A very long and very brutal first installment of The Godfather series. Watching Michael grow up to be what his father once was is very refreshing, if a little sad that he didnât learn from his fathers mistakes. The amount of deaths that occurred was high, and you felt particularly sorry for some of those who died, for example, Michaelsâ wife that he had in Sicily. A great film overall.",positive

"""What is the greatest film of all time?"" is a question posed by many. Some point out that their favourite movie of all time was the one they just saw in the cinema, some find it hard to slect just one, and some just ponder and think of a film with a certain something, and say the first movie to meet this criteria that pops into their head. The greatest film of all time question can never be answered correctly, of course, as so many different opinions render the ultimate answer impossible to state. But there are some films that come very close to being the one, and The Godfather happens to be one of them. To say The Godfather is a classic is an understatement. It is a film that breaks the boundaries, absorbs the viewer, captures them in its grasp and transports them into its world. The characters, the story, the settings...it is all so real, so true to life, that we forget this is a film we are watching. From the film's beginning (""I believe in America""), to the final, shocking, BRILLIANT final scenes, The Godfather is a riveting experience that is way ahead of its time and a film to define not a decade, but a century. Francis Ford Coppola's direction of a flawless ensemble of characters is masterful, as he paints the tale of the Corleone crime family in genius fashion. The screenplay by Coppola and author of the novel The Godfather Mario Puzo is captivating and the lifeblood of the film. But the actors, each and every one of them, are the epitome of the film's excellence. They are not actors, they are characters - every move, every word they speak is so natural, so real that we forget they are even portraying men and women who are fictional. Flawless from first scene to final shot, The Godfather is the closest one could get to a perfect film, and, one could state without much argument, the greatest film of all time.",positive

"I truly can't decide what was the best part of this film. Was it the story? The suspense? The acting? Or, perhaps a combination of every thing. Coppola's masterpiece of drama is bold and engrossing, and never leaves the feeling of disappointment. There is a perfect story to enjoy, which chronicals the story of a crime family of New York in the 1940's. The acting is some of the best I've ever seen; Brando, Pacino, Duvall, and Caan all play their parts flawlessly. There really is nothing wrong with this film. If you haven't seen it, watch it now: it's an offer you simply can't refuse.",positive

I don't see what the big deal is about these movies. The acting is great but the movie itself is friggin boring. All of them are,negative
"The Godfather, Great Movies Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets 5 out of 5. This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get 5 out of 5, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.",positive
"The term ""timeless"" is not one thrown around lightly, however in the case of the Godfather there are few words more fitting. Like Roger Ebert said about the third film, the Godfather is one of the most fully fleshed out stories ever told. We know the characters & relate their actions to how familiar we are with their personalities, beliefs & story.The perfect casting is not easily overlooked as the strong bond of family is tried and challenged throughout. The opening scene where Don Vito is talking to the undertaker (my personal favorite) is so beautifully shot & acted, it sets the bar for the rest of the movie. The characters themselves evolve throughout the feature & much like Terminator 1 it sets the stage for its incredible sequel by way of character growth. Personally my favorite character in this movie next to the godfather himself, is Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The quiet spoken adoptee of the Corleone family. Whether you're watching Sonny lose his temper or enjoying Marlon Brando's incredible presence in every scene he's in, this is one of the best movies & best stories ever told. One which you are more likely to enjoy than anything you've seen in theaters for quite some time.",positive
Francis Ford Coppola doing the film adaptations of the the bestselling novel by Mario Puzo is just amazing! Marlon Brando & James Cann give some amazing performances along with Al Pacino too! I have got to say I couldn't see Vito being portrayed by anyone else in this film! but I will say Robert De Niro does a great portrayal of Vito in The Godfather pt.2! The Godfather is a classic and is a must see!,positive
"My all-time favorite movie, enough said. I have nothing negative to say about it. The acting, the plot, and the dialogue are all great. An epic movie from start to finish.",positive
An offer that cannot be refused by any moviegoer!!!,positive
"I will admit I was very skeptical of seeing The Godfather and liking it. I'm not a big fan of Francis Ford Coppola's work (after Apocalypse Now SUCKED!) but I have changed my mind on Coppolla since. The Godfather had a great story and it was only made better by the amazing characters. You would think the movie was made solely on the shoulders of Marlon Brando, but personally, he was overshadowed completely by Al Pacino's portrayl of his son, Michael. Michael Corleone was a stronger character who goes through a more profound change, from shy and quiet and assuring himself he doesn't want to the follow in his father's footsteps to this blood thirsty gang leader. I loved the scene where Michael was taking his Christian vows as his nephews ""godfather"" and meanwhile he ordered out a huge hit on all the other prime mafia leaders. The scenes are done in parallel to show he isn't a changed man. The music also set the scene and the costumes fit perfectly into the era. The Godfather was great!",positive

"This is an epic gangster movie and it was long, but its a classic. this may be the best gangster movie there is. When I first saw it I was surprised how Al Pacino, James Cann, and Robert Duvall looked so young. I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse",positive
"This film has spawned so many gangster cliches and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film. On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem. The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children. As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too. Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime. 4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)",positive

"Coppola takes one of the ugliest, most thuggish elements of society, and sets within this world a grand, operatic Greek tragedy about family, loyalty and honour. In the real world, these are not the kinds of things that exist in the mob, as made plain by the vastly superior Goodfellas. But I'm prepared to examine the film in terms of how successful it is as this grand drama, and frankly, I find it incredibly tedious. The characters aren't that interesting, the arc by which Pacino becomes the ruthless Don is almost as rapid and fake as Anakin Skywalker becoming Darth Vader in the shitty most recent Star Wars. I will admit this film has its fair share of iconic scenes that really stick in your mind due to terrific dialogue and staging, but such moments are too rare. At least half of the film is bland, tedious and unengaging; I was checking my watch for most of the running time, and that says it all about the allegedly compelling, most overrated film of all time.",negative
"A majestic, somber modern epic of a king's de-ascension from the throne and the struggle to find his heir amongst his sons. Yes it is patriarchal to an enormously high degree, but it isn't a film to inspire morally, it is more so a Shakespearean tragedy of the spiraling fall into darkness, and contains a terrific lead performance from Al Pacino who conveys very realistically one of the most dramatic arcs in all of fiction. This story combined with the autumn colored cinematography and Mediterranean inspired score and art direction paints one of the most beautifully made films of all time, a perfect combination really and one of the few films that really feels like a painting; a true work of art.",positive

"Who the hell doesn't like The Godfather? If someone told me that The Godfather is boring, terrible, or ""I've never seen it before""...then something is seriously wrong with you. The Godfather is a masterpiece, known as the greatest film ever made (which I 110% agree with). The Godfather is on my list of all time favorite movies. Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the main theme of the film is family. The acting in The Godfather is at the top of its game. And it's also considered the film with the best cast. Marlon Brando is great as Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is just as great (this being one of his first movie roles). But I personally think that actor who gives the best performance is James Caan as hot headed Sonny Corleone. His performance is electrifying, one of the best I have ever seen. You really don't see great performances like his anymore. If you haven't seen this film, then take 3 hours of your time and see why this is known as the Greatest Film Ever! 10/10",positive

"Francis Ford Coppola's epic gangster film which set the benchmark for the genre & has been copied many times after. Just look at the cast!! Not a duffer amongst them & despite Brando & Pacino acting everyone off screen, I've always thought that Robert Duvall is very under-rated in this film. The music is also a very strong part of the film with Nino Rota's brilliant theme setting the tone from the start.",positive

"The Godfather will always be the pinnacle of mob dramas-what else can I say? Between the excellent direction of Mr. Coppola, and the spot-on casting and great performances of all the actors, it is a perfect mix of wise-guy violence and psychoanalysis of the cause and effect of organzed crime. The film doesn't condemn or condone an of its material; it is a rare presentation of an ugly part of human nature that remains entirely neutral. The audience is allowed to judge and make their own decisions about the characters, without cues to affect their decision in the end. A classic that is not to be missed.",positive

"Francis Ford Coppola's landmark crime epic is one of the finest and most riveting American films ever made, which is based upon Mario Puzo best selling novel. It is set in 1945 on Long Island and tells the tale of a criminal dynasty, with an absolutely superlative Oscar winning performance by the late great Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of the most powerful Mafia clan in the United States, his youngest son Michael, played brilliantly by Al Pacino in breakout Oscar nominated performance, has just returned from World War II and is attending the wedding of his sister Connie, played wonderfully by Talia Shire, the joyful family occasion is short lived because of a ruthless drug dealer named Virgil Sollozzo, impressively played by the late character actor Al Lettieri, who is looking for financial support as well as protection from the Corleone family, but when Don Vito refuses and turns down Sollozzo's request, Sollozzo tries to have Don Vito assassinated by two hit men who gun him down outside a fruit stand, but the Don survives the hit barely. This will set a series of deadly events into play and full scale Mob war will begin. Masterful direction by Coppola, with impeccable supporting performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, and Abe Vigoda, breathtakingly filmed with beautiful on location sequences shot in Sicily by the late great master cinematographer Gordon Willis, Nino Rota's unforgettable musical score is powerfully haunting. This is one of the few rare times where the film is better than the book. ""The Godfather"" is a history-making cinematic masterpiece that is the winner of three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor: Marlon Brando, and Screenplay: Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo. Highly Recommended.",positive

"It's hard to judge a film like 'The Godfather', especially for someone of my generation. Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has accrued a legendary status; it's difficult to watch a film that is often touted as the best of all time with an open mind and no preconceptions. However, after watching The Godfather many times and reading the novel on which it was based upon, it's clearly something very special. The film is a sprawling epic that rewards the viewer with a savagely twisting, multi-faceted plot. It's a mobsters' coming of age tale that's laced with marriage, favours, family, betrayal, tragedy, violence and death. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is introduced on the day of his daughter's wedding, a very special day in Sicilian tradition where the father of the bride is to deny no man a special favour. The beneficiaries' utmost respect for the Don is illustrated in the opening stanza, their displays of courtesy coming in the form of personal address and greeting rituals. The Don is a man of respect and principle, a man who puts emphasis on what's fair, denying to avenge, for example, a father's anguish over the rape of his daughter by means of murder - 'That is not justice; your daughter's still alive'. In other circles however; the Don is not so respected. Vito Corleone is an old fashioned Don, what is referred to as a 'Moustache Pete'; he is reluctant to delve into the business of drugs, unlike the contemporaries from the rival New York crime families. The Don's refusal turns the relationship between the Corleones and many of the other families sour. It is how the ensuing violence is regarded as just 'business' that is the cold, harsh danger of the film. Its depiction of violence is visceral and often occurs when not expected. Rather quickly, the Corleone criminal empire falls apart; the next generation having to revitalise the family and reclaim their place at the top of the five families. The film is perfectly cast; the primary characters of Vito (Marlon Brando), Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Fredo (John Cazale), Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) and Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) are all expertly interpreted from Mario Puzo's magnum opus. The scores of supporting actors are also without fault; it's a true acting showcase. After reading the novel, it's remarkable how faithfully envisioned the characters are in the film, which is thanks to a combination of physicality and astute interpretation. The Godfather is a brilliant adaptation of Mario Puzo's masterfully told story; the 1969 novel was written with such an authenticity that it almost seems like non-fiction in certain passages. I think it's true that when one thinks of a gangster, they picture the omnipotent Vito Corleone sitting back in his chair, his glum face contemplating with that infinite sagacity and authority. The Godfather is a true spectacle in both mediums; deciding which is best is a difficult task. The only aspect that I felt was stronger in the book was character development. The character of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is given greater depth in the novel; Michael's transcendence seeming comparatively abrupt in the celluloid interpretation. The character of Luca Brasi is abundantly more powerful in the book, whom whilst is an ally of the Corleone family, is penned as an ominous nemesis with a dark, brutal secret. The film, meanwhile, essentially depicts Brasi as an oaf; he is a far less intimidating figure. Additionally, many of the supporting characters are also given interesting back stories by Puzo, notably Captain McCluskey. Of course, that level of intricacy is possible in a novel, while a film could easily become bloated with such detailing. Ultimately, 'The Godfather' is a film made by a highly talented crew who combined the seminal prose of a skilled author with brilliant direction, perfect performances, effective cinematography and the utterly beautiful, distinctive music of Nino Rota and Carlo Savina to produce one of the best, well rounded and moving films ever made. It is a film that is wholly deserving of the term 'required viewing'.",positive
"Classic, riveting, like an opera.",positive
one of the greatest!!!!,positive
Best 2 hours on film. Ever...,positive
Best film of all time. Period.,positive
"Probably my favourite film of all time, The Godfather is a work of pure cinematic genius. A film is about losing yourself within a plot line and becoming infatuated with every hook and turn. The elements crafted in this film continue to influence modern day TV drama and of course the obligatory gangster films that are spewed out ten a penny within the hollywood film industry. Brando is brilliant as the lead in an original piece of story telling which has been made better by using the power of cinema.",positive

Top 5- Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.,positive
Arguably the greatest motion picture ever made.,positive
"A true classic that has lost some edge though over the years, the cast are amazing though and watching Pacino gradually become corrupt and sinister, a true loss of innocence. Whilst having a sweeping cinematic feel with heavily orchestrated cinematography (Willis may have lit one of the darkest films ever here) it still works as an introspective family drama, examining the Corleones under a microscope. A large scale home movie oozing care and attention from Coppola.",positive
"Le secret des grandes fortunes sans cause apparente est un crime oublié, parce qu'il a été proprement fait.",positive
"A three-hour movie has no right taking story-telling shortcuts, especially when it's being adapted from a hefty novel... but even with huge gaps in the story logic, it's entirely engaging, and only slightly confusing. I'm not ashamed to say I used the rewind button numerous times.",positive
wow!!! it's fantastic movies...all the god father series...,positive
One of the best directed films i have ever seen. The plot is excellent. any true film fan must see this movie.,positive

Pure gold! Awesome flick!,positive
Great Movie but 2 is still better,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time. It's as simple as that. The God Father tells a story about a mafia family and executes it perfectly. The story is about betrayal and trust. Each character performs their role exactly like in the book in some ways better. It's one of my favorite movies for a reason. This movie is almost undescribable.,positive
"One of the best Mafia films ever made. I liked two better, but this one was great because it set such amazing groundwork and told such a compelling story. The entire trilogy is a great exercise in character psychology and development.",positive
"The original Mafia movie which has set the bar for every movie of every genera that follows it. it also has memorable lines such as ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" and ""I don't care how many daigo guinea WOP greaseball goombahs come out of the woodwork! [Tom: I'm German-Irish]. perhaps the best movie ever and if not pretty close too it",positive
A simply great film. Everyone should attempt to see the masterpiece,positive
"What was it about exactly? That was the first thought that comes to mind about this film. The plot was not that engaging at all, while I could have some grasp over what was going on it was not enough to be engaged with the story for nearly 3 hours. I seriously can not tell why on earth this garbage is such a big deal, it is well made, great production values and some decent performances but it lacks point to the story throughout. I think this confirmed why I always felt the Gangster genre was painfully overrated",negative
"Just about perfect. Amazing cast, beautiful cinematography, uncompromisingly gritty and relentlessly gripping for its full 3 hours. One of the greatest Hollywood films of all time",positive

This is my favourite ganster movie of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are just brilliant. Even though this is a 3 hour movie you never once hope it will end soon,positive
"Al Pacino takes over as the head of the Corleone Family, to get back at the families who killed his brother and tried to kill his father. Good, but not great, struggle to understand all that was said and who everybody was, no real connection with any of the characters. Prego",positive
"About as good as story telling can get, a truly beautiful film about the history of a family which is gripping and heartbreaking in ways that most films simply cannot acheive. Coppola's steeps this film in family history and characters that are impossible to forget. The casting is superb and whilst Brando is heading this family, for me this is Pacino's film. His work in this film is subtle and underplayed to perfection. Watching the changes in his Michael, it is possible to see the point where he literally changes from an idealistic war hero to a cold and manipulative crime boss. His eyes literally change as he becomes more calculating. Everytime I watch the film I am astounded by his work here. The cast as a whole are exceptional and even the minor characters are well developed and have a reason to be on screen. My favourite sequences involve Michael's extended stay in Sicily and his marriage to Apolonia, they are absoluely gorgeous. Visually, the 50's era is recreated perfectly with that beautiful golden feel, coupled with that beautiful music which captures the story so well. Ultimately, I view this as a story about a family rather than a gangster film. It is complex, wonderfully played and rewards it's viewers everytime it is watched.",positive
My favourite movie of all time!,positive
An iconic film espicially for the time. The high calibre of acting mixed with the flawless story makes one of the most memorable films of all time.

"I don't know why it took me so long to watch this movie. This movie has been built up to me as probably the best movie ever created. This is pervasive everywhere in society... When I finally got to it a few months ago I found it entertaining... but epic... no. Again I would chalk that up to maybe a generational thing... people who grew up with it, lived it like I did say Star Wars from a young age. Maybe it was a break through for its time? I really don't know, I didn't live in its shadow growing up. I'm in general a gangster movie fan, I have watched quite a few over the past year and have never been disappointed. I would personally put Casino up before The Godfather.",negative
"This movie is my favorite movie of all time. To me, this film is complete genius, there is no other movie in the world that had such an incredible impact on me or made me think so much about my own humanity. This film's cinematography is completely genius. The way that Coppola uses darkness and light to show the main character's inner struggle. Some of the most famous scenes are in this movie such as the opening one where we hear the words ""I made him an offer he couldn't refuse."" Which leads to the acting. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando have the best performances that I have seen of them in this movie. Al Pacino brings the character of Michael Corleone to life showing his inner tumoil and slow transformation to ruthless Mob Boss in the most beautiful and subtle way. Marlon Brando proceeds to have one of those performances where you don't even realiz that it is him performing. He plays his character with finesse and cleverness. The music is also fitting in this movie. It brings the true italian spirit to the movie but also infuses it with the darkness that tends to lie behind even the most perfect looking family. This movie is a classic that every person should watch.",positive
"I reviewed this classic, which is my all time personal favorite, only to have a five star rating on my jacket. I'm sure most have seen it already. If you haven't, what are you waiting for? Acting, casting, cinematography, story, it hits the mark with all.",positive
"This movie has it all. Action, good acting, excitement and so on.",positive
"I'm a firm believer that this is better than Part II. What can you say? Amazing, every single time.",positive
"One of the greatest films ever made. Aside from Caan's infamous whiffed punch in the brother-in-law beating scene, everything is just perfect. Stellar cast, fantastic performances, great story.",positive
what can we say...meravigliosa,positive
"What can be said about the Greatest Film ever made. Coppola & Brando personify microscopic perfection in Direction & Acting respectively while simultaneously giving birth to the Crime Genre. Thus, immortalizing Don Corleone. P.S. A Must watch for all Aspiring Actors....watching the intro scene is a thing I do on a daily basis.",positive
"I have been unkind to this film in the past. This is the 5th time of watching, and it's grown on me. This film could be called 'two weddings, one funreal and a christening'. It starts pretty dull - a 20 minute wedding which is totally unnecessary - we get happy singing Itallians - meanwhile Brando almost sent me to sleep with his mumbling agony aunt routine. Thank God he's not in the picture all the time. Anyway, Al Pacino enters the story and slowly the characters and story begin to shape. There are some memorable scenes (the resturant and the hospital, also the film guy waking up in his bed - that's when the film really starts.) The first hour is very castrophobic - mainly based in small dark rooms, then when Pacino leaves America the scenery expands. I'm not a gangster movie fan. I probably won't watch The Godfather again untill i've forgotten the details. It's not one of my favourites....but it is a very good film.",negative
"One of the greatest movies ever to hit the silver screen! Contains a memorable ensemble of characters and the actors/actresses who played their respective parts. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are the high points of the cast. It contains a dark atmosphere but with a little light to it, giving it a unique look.",positive

"I'm not a big fan of mafia movies, but this is pretty epic.",negative
"""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even great masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it. The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening. But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace. The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings. In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions. It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing. It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that. Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century. 10/10",positive
"The book was better, still...epic american cinema.",negative
"Incredible motion picture. One of my favorite movies of all-time. The acting is so real it does'nt seem like actors in a movie and of course, the awsome and graphic violence and storyline that tie it all together! The best movies were made in the 1970s",positive
"What is there to say about this movie, besides the fact that it is probably the greatest achievement in cinematic history? Everything about the movie is out of this world. Meaning it is hard to believe human beings could have made this. The acting is top notch, and could you expect anything less from the likes of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino or Robert Duvall? Brando won an Oscar for a reason, it's one of the few rare times I've actually agreed with the Oscars. Brando's gruff, but recognizable voice and intense gaze makes him the center of the spotlight whenever he's around. The plot is engaging and epic, I guarantee it will suck you in and keep you enthralled into the credits show up. Tons of twists and turns and enough great characters to make a 20 year long TV show. This very movie has influenced Hollywood and movies in general. It's heavily quoted and spoofed, and it ranks upon the top of almost everybody's ""Greatest Movie"" lists. Some may claim the movie is boring with its long length and tons of dialogue, but the movie is art in motion. A masterpiece that had awakened when first released. Besides, if you don't like this movie there are plenty of mindless Micheal Bay movies out there for you to enjoy. Enjoy drowning in your own ignorance. =] A perfect 10. Very rare for me.",positive

no one can ever made this kind of movie this kind of good..ever,positive
"They removed many interesting episodes which provide back-stories to some of the characters and justification for some of the acts. Despite removal of these contents the movie is still slow. The don is even more dull than the image I had in mind. Storyline has been altered at few places causing confusion - eg. Michael does not approach Kay after he became the done in the book. To me, the book is still the masterpiece - the movie is not. A remake should be made, but unfortunately it won't be, since it is unlikely someone will risk to compete with this movie's hype.",negative
"When Francis Ford Coppola, said he's gonna make a movie about Mafia, everyone laughed....After its release, The Godfather made a lot cry!!!!!!!!!",positive

Well, I decided to see this film a second time and realized the greatness. However, I still don't this film is the greatest of all times. I would put this movie on somwhere around 20 or 30 but in the top ten. Vito Corleone, and his 2 sons Sonny and Michael are some of my favourite characters. The movie has an incredible score. This movie is of course one of the best gangster films. It has one of the best casts. There is almost no way you can find this film dissappointing. After a third viewing, this film has become my 2nd favourite movie of all time. This movie has something other movies don't.",positive

"A truly great film that gives a real look at the 50's mafia way of life. All the characters in this movie are unforgettable, but especially the brilliant Marlon Brando as Don Corleone, The Godfather. The movie starts out beautifully with a wedding, but the rest of the film is only tragedy, and revenge, at its best. One of the best moments of the movie, is the sacrifice that Michael must make, to save his father and keep the family together. The movie is a classic, a masterpiece, and features a beautiful score, fantastic acting, and scenes, characters, and words you will never forget in your life. It deserved all it's nominations and awards. It is truly a unique film, that will hopefully pass from generation to generation. A masterpiece, that everyone should have already seen.",positive

"A solid movie. I couldn't empathise or sympathise with any of the Corleone family. They all seemed beyond saving and pretty odious throughout, but I think that was meant to be the appeal? I dunno. I prefer The Conversation",negative
"Tiba-tiba gue pengen ngereview film trilogi ini walaupun gue nonton film ini Agustus tahun lalu. Ini semua gara-gara si Nenni yang nelpon gue kayak orang kebakaran jenggot (eh dia kan ga punya jenggot, jilbab deh) karena gue dapat karakter Michael Corleone. Cukup aneh sebenarnya, sebab gue dan ada satu orang lagi yang dapat karakter Michael Corleone sebenarnya lebih menyukai karakter Vito Corleone. Alkisah di film Godfather pertama digambarkan karakter Vito Corleone, seorang pimpinan mafia yang sangat berkuasa. Dia bisa menyingkirkan siapa pun yang menghalangi niat dan usahanya. Pada saat itu Michael Corleone yang tengah di mabuk cinta dengan Kay justru tidak suka dengan kegiatan mafia tersebut. Dia bahkan bilang ke Kay bahwa tidak ingin terlibat sedikit pun dengan kegiatan mafia keluarganya. Dia tidak suka dengan kekerasan dan organisasi mafia yang penuh intrik. Namun ternyata prinsip itu bisa berubah seratus delapan puluh derajat, bahkan Michael bisa bermetamorfosa menjadi pimpinan mafia yang keji dan tidak pandang bulu jika dibandingkan dengan ayahnya. Saat Vito tertembak, ketika dirawat di rumah sakit justru Michael yang paling peduli dan memegang peranan penting saat menjaga ayahnya dari serangan berikutnya. Berbeda dengan ayahnya yang lebih bijaksana dalam bertindak untuk memperoleh solusi terbaik, Michael sanggup menghabisi saudara sendiri jika dianggap berkhianat. Cukup ironis, orang yang tadinya begitu menghindari tindak kekerasan justru ringan tangan dalam membalas dendam.",negative

"If anyone wants to learn how to adapt a book into a great film without losing any of the style of the book but capturing a unique point of view completly original to the film, study The Godfather. The casting is amazing, let alone the performances, the cinematography has been praised and study in depth, but I always thought Francis Ford Coppla as a screen writer went always under appreciated. Of course, when you're directing films of this caliber, who cares about the screenplay. The film seems so natural and captures the perfect mafia formula, keep it in the family. Gangster films are as American as apple pie, but this was the first to take out the greed, and the idea of the mobster as a villian. Coppla sets his saga against the post war American life where he explores family values and violance, love and romance against crime. Coppla show us the brutality but also the sympathy in perfect juxtaposion. And when Michael shuts out Kay, it only opened the rest of us to what this crime family was all about, heart.",positive

"My friend made me watch this cause i heard about it, but never actually bothered to watch this movie. I was watching this and the beginning has a slow start but just gets better and better which I enjoy in movies. The storyline was just so amazing. And for this movie to be 1972 it had alot of pretty amazing effects which shocked me. The blood was orange! But i enjoyed watching this.

Not much to say that hasn't already been said,positive
"I can finally scratch this one off my list! I feel ashamed that it took so long to see it, and that it took a night on AMC for me to finally view it. Well, here we go! The Corleone family is one of the five families that rule New York City. There is constantly tension between the groups and the aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone manages to raise his sons accustomed to it. But as time passes, events take place that change the family forever. I cannot say I was disappointed. The atmosphere was brilliant, positively chilling. An excellent portrayal of the 40's & 50's. Brilliant performances from literally an all-star cast including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DuVall, James Caan, and that's only in the family. I consider this a rite of passage for any film lover, and I was right to do so. The story is intriguing and engulfing, if a bit slow-moving. Perhaps one or two misplaced bullets, but otherwise the killing was thrilling. Now this film obviously worked better as a book, and can only attract those who are willing to completely dive into it. Be prepared to realize that just about every line of dialogue is either a lie, or is going to be reversed later in the story due to circumstances. And again, the one thing that everyone complains about is the length. Four hours is a long time to stay focused on a movie with very little adrenaline pumping through it. The camerawork was perfect; not one misplaced shot. It paints a perfect and bleak picture of the Italian mafia. But to quote Moe from the episode of The Simpsons when he tells the story to Maggie: ""Intermission. What do you want, it's a saga."" I eagerly await the sequel, but now I know I cannot pay $60 to buy the Coppola Restoration Trilogy. Oh well. Still a brilliant, bleak, realistic, and engaging film about 50's New York underworld. The Godfather receives 10 out of 10. Perfect acting, perfect camerawork, perfect music, and perfect story. ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" -Calo ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" -Clemenza ""Leave the gun. Take the cannolis."" -Clemenza ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" -Vito Corleone",positive
Best movie of all time. Best acting Best cinematogrophay Best directing Best plot Best delivery The more times you watch it the more you will like it it's a level above any other film.,positive
"The fatal flaw of ""The Godfather"" is how it is perceived. Nothing more can be said Coppola's of superb direction or of the cast, except possibly James Caan and Diana Keeton should be given more praise for their performances.But the image it portrays is wrong and the fault lies in the idolisation of the Don. For clarity the Mafia are a repugnant blight on society. They have condemned hundreds of thousands of people to a life of misery and fear. Contrary to some public perception they murder innocent people and are at the centre of much of the European drugs trade. But most of us have to admit to admiration of these murderous parasites and this film must take some of the blame. The position of the Don is God-like and the traditions of the Mafia treated with religious respect. This like ""a Clockwork Orange"" is probable not what the creators intended but it is how it appears. It does portray the human frailness of the minor characters but the Godfather is superhuman, above man. The film itself is the story of Michael's accent to this divine state. I have far more time for ""The Sopranos"" or Scorsese's earlier work where the Mafia are just twisted, evil and often mentally unbalanced individuals not this elegy to the power of the Mafia.",negative
"Wonderfully visualized, acted and produced. The cinemaphotography is beautiful, enhancing the already beautiful locations and excellent acting. A masterpiece of film making.",positive
Perfect. The greatest film ever made.,positive
"""Now you come to me and you say 'Don Corleone, give me justice', but you don't even ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather."" the godfather is definitely more than a mafia film or a crime saga of its age. some scenes are carved in viewers minds, and the godfather has a lot of such scenes. that is what i mean when i talk about immortality.",positive

"Tied with The Godfather Part II as my favourite film of all time. Francis Ford Coppola directs with operatic power and gets towering performances out of his actors.

The screenplay is flawlessly structured and contains as many great lines as Citizen Kane and Casablanca.",positive

"Bonasera: I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom but I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a ""boy friend,"" not an Italian. She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late. I didn't protest. Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her. Like an animal. When I went to the hospital her nose was broken. Her jaw was shattered, held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain. But I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life. A beautiful girl.

"If there is any classical movie out there, it would be, The Godfather. The Godfather showed how a movie should be, if it had family,business, and mobs. Vito Corleone is the Godfather, his family quote is, ""Do you spend time with your family?...because If a man douesn't spend time with his family, then he isn't a real man."", that gave the audience, of how much the Godfather cares for his family. In the movie Al Pacino plays as Michael, his brothers call him, Micky or Mick. He plays a important role in the movie. His dad the Godfather dies, and he takes over the family business. There are 5 family mobs in New York, that the Corleone's are at war. Michael shoots a police officer and Sollozzo, they were in a Itailin Restuarent and Michael asked for permission to goto the restroom. In the restroom he gets what he needs to exterminate the two enemies, that were giving the Corleone Family trouble. After that, he traveled to Sicily for a year or more. There he found a wife to marry, but it didn't take to long to find Michael. They set a bomb in their car, which killed Michael's wife. The movie showed, great acting, and having it at the right time and mood. This movie is a masterpiece. If your in the mood for something delightful and enjoying, then you have yourself a movie. --A.Haynes--",positive

one of the all time favorites,positive
"Overrated and ironic. The film is supposed to stem out on the idea of family, a man cannot understand the meaning of family if he kills people. The suspense is good, but the film does not focus enough on Michael and is pulled down by that. As far as the acting goes, it is filled with emotion, but many a times it is hard to understand what exactly is being said. The film is not the greatest film of all time, but as a gangster film, it might be one of the few good ones as it does have character and passion. I was somewhat disappointed, it is a good enough movie, I just feel it is an over hyped and overrated film.",positive
"Best film ever made beside The Godfather Part II. It has everything you could ask for in a film and if it was 2 hours longer you wouldn't complain. As John says, ""class.""",positive

"It had been a little while since I'd watched this, and it was on for Thanksgiving. Why not watch it with my mom and sister? The Godfather is one of the great movies that I feel completely earns its hype. It's actually gotten better for me as I've seen more movies and have changed my tastes. Michael Corleone's rise to Don is a totally iconic and encapsulating character arc. Nino Rota's music is classic and I feel that Rota's darker themes (such as in the hospital) go overlooked and are just as simple and telling as the main Godfather theme. A superstar cast delivers wonderful acting start to finish. I think really the best thing about The Godfather, beyond the way it's shot and the performances and the music, is the story. It's so engrossing and perfectly-paced. I could watch this again and again and still feel the same goosebumps when Michael screams ""ENOUGH!"" to Kay in the final scene as I did the first time. Absolutely timeless.",positive
Perhaps the pinnacle of classic American cinematic storytelling.,positive

This movie is just amazing everything abiut it is just so well done,even though I like the sequel better this is still noted as one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.I love the cast for this movei every actor and actress was just brilliant inn this especially Marlon Brando who delivers one of the greatest performances of all tome.Al Pacino was brilliant and Talia Shire is just one of my favorite actresses.The stroy is brilliant as well.The story is just so original and as the movie progresses you notice how incredible the character development is.The movie is just amazing and I highly recommend it who just loves cinema.",positive

"if i want to make a movie, it should be like this. same frames and in a tint of sepia!",positive
"Coppola's original crime saga is extraordinary - piece of such iconic quality and genius that most of its ideas are now cliched or overused in modern cinema. Whilst it has a tiring running time, its narrative covers such scope and complexity that any less would be an insult to its epic story. There is not much about it that can be said in terms of what makes it great, but there is such subtle precision in its craft - the writing is marked by a richness and fluence rarely seen, the acting believably real and intense, the cinematography never obnoxious but always efficient and creative in its own subtle way. Coppola has such a great eye for crafting and telling a story and it is conveyed through the orginization and perfection of each scene and how it plays out. I had another dozen or so paragraphs but Flixter has miraculously deleted them. Pity.",positive
An absolute masterpiece.,positive
its a classic! how can you NOT love this movie???,positive
the best mobster movie ever made!,positive
You can't blv that this is from the 70s.,positive
"Can anyone fault this movie? It's got everything a movie should have. Love Marlon Brando, just love him.",positive

Excellent film that has shaped Hollywood ever since.,positive
RESPECT / HONOR / LOTALTY/ is the way of my Sicilian peoples . And yeah . I'm half Siciliano !!!,positive
VERDICT: 10/10 Bloody Cannolis Might just the greatest movie ever made and still holds up as the best in the trilogy. - Read the rest of my review at ctcmr.com -,positive
"""I believe in America,"" says Bonasera, the undertaker. ""America has made my fortune."" Bonasera, played with eventual unctuousness by Salvatore Corsitto, is speaking to a large figure in a darkened room. Bonasera's daughter was raped, and the American justice system failed her, so he told his wife that ""for justice, we must go to Don Corleone."" Marlon Brando, in the classic American movie THE GODFATHER, is Vito Corleone, Godfather to many and patriarch of a large and loyal family. It was produced for $6 million (which was earned in one weekend of March 24-26th, 1972) and grossed nearly $300 million. It ran 2 hrs and 55 minutes and it was the first installment of a 3 part film that eventually billed Marlon Brando (who won an Academy Award for his role), Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, Danny Aiello, Andy Garcia, Joe Mantegna, John Savage - the list goes on. It's been voted one of the top 3 trilogies along with Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. The second installment won Best Picture Oscar directed by Francis Ford Coppola. This is one of the few 6 to 7 hour trilogies that broadcast networks play and actually have increased viewer ship because of it. It's made $41,000,000 in video game sales alone. You wouldn't have GTA without the God Father. How much of our (and the rest of the world's) culture, perception of what organized crime was, has become; affected nearly every thread of the social fabric in this country. Because of the Godfather we have reality shows for retired mobsters. And it paved the way for other great gangster films like Goodfellas, Casino and even Get Shorty. It was the publics educational foundation of what mobsters meant and it has stuck with us ever since. Unfortunate for all those law abiding Italian citizenry who have been pegged as insta-criminals because of the mob, but come on - what other culture has done what they have done... turned crime into a glorious profession that you can actually RETIRE from! And make movies. I don't see any glorious movies about the Jamaican Posse or MS13? Definitely a MUST SEE and then A MUST SEE again and again and again!",positive

"A classic? Probably. Overated? Definately. Once an intriguing film in the 70's, now it is quite a slow and boring film. I like GF2 better but only because it is saved by Niro, Al Pacino's parts drove me to sleep.",negative
fantastic direction and an even better casting.,positive
"The Godfather Trilogy is one of the greatest sagas in film history and it begins with this intense first chapter as Michael Coreleone,played by Al Pacino,gradually losing his soul when he begins to run his father's criminal empire after his father is shot by a rival Mafia family. A powerful achievement in story,direction,and acting.",positive
good- but the sequel is better. Robert de nero is a brilliant addition- naturally,positive
A Complete and TOTAL classic. The best Mafia film ever made!,positive
Good but definitley overrated,negative

saw this movie when the game released. One of the best movies I've ever seen,positive
one of the best movies I have ever seen,positive
"Although it is a classic and I respect what it has done for the genre and the film industry, this film is dreadfully overrated. Yes. Overrated. At the time of its release, no one had seen anything like it before, or anything well done on the subject. Well, guess what? That era is long gone thanks to Scorcese's Goodfellas. Even Casino surpasses The Godfather on the subject. Horrible direction, moderate performances, meaningless dialogue that happens to be quotable, and much too lengthy. The sequel is a little better, but that's not saying much for the most overrated film of all time.",negative
the father of all mafia movies. i dont know anyone who had not seen this. this is a classic and a must see. great acting great story... great movie,positive
Al Pacino made these movies awesome to watch.,positive
An instant classic. A long movie that goes by too fast and by the time it ends you will be at the top of your seat wanting more. Flawless story and acting. Marlon Brando was born to play the role of the godfather.,positive
The Best Movie Ever!,positive
can't believe it's taken me this long to see this all the way through. very engaging. Excellent performances by Marlon Brando and a young Al Pacino.,positive

One of my favorite movies of all time hands down!,positive
"One of the most over-rated movies of all time. Still a decent film, of course, but not the indisputable ""greatest movie of all time"" many claim it to be.",negative
A perfect movie classic,positive
"This movie is epic and one of the greatest masterpieces of all time, i watched a one time release of this movie on cinema and its the best movie on cinema ive ever seen and ive seen alot, one of my all time favs! it had some of the best actors in Brando, Pacino and duvall, all the cast were great, an instant 5 star classic.",positive
Are you joking me? It's the Godfather...you can't beat that.,positive
"Ogni cinefilo, tra gli scaffali dalla propria videoteca, per la straordinaria grandezza, conservi una copia de ""Il Padrino"". Un capolavoro di assoluta intensitÃ , una delle migliori produzioni della storia della cinematografia: il cast eccezionale che vede un Marlon Brando maturo passare il testimone ad un giovane Al Pacino, fino ad allora sconosciuto, che danno con la propria interpretazione spessore ai due protagonisti principali, ritreandoli nei minimi dettagli. Oltre alla presenza di un cast straordinario, come Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire (Adriana nei vari ""Rocky""), Diane Keaton e John Cazale, la scenggiatura e il soggetto (dei romanzi di Puzo) Ã¨ solida e nonostante la durata del film (3 ore circa) riesce sempre a mantenere l'intrattenimento o per meglio dire il pathos molto alto. Le vicende di una famiglia di mafiosi italo-americana si articolano nella New York della metÃ  del Novecento, scenario che sembra il palcoscenico ideale per ambientare questo tipo di storia, simile ad una tragedia greca e ricca di tutti gli elementi del genere drammatico cinematografico. Difficile interpretare e soprattutto la maestositÃ  di un film del genere, basta solo vederlo. Voto 5/5",positive
Every man should own this.,positive
the best mafia movie ever made.,positive
An American classic!,positive
The greatest movie of all time. Three Acadamy Awards,positive
A true American story starting in the 40s. All the characters are well written. Enjoyable but violent.,positive

best movie of all time,positive
absolutly 1 ov tha gr8est film EVA made,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
"A sprawling, multi-faceted crime epic that never feels like it's 3 hours long. The real treat here more than anything else is the acting; these men seamlessly turn themselves into mobsters. It's never Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, it's freakin' Vito Corleone. Fantastic!",positive
"Personally, I think this movie is a bit overrated. Then again, most consider Part II to be the better one. I thought this movie was very good, but it wasn't like the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE like everyone says it is. It wasn't quite as impressive as I thought it was gonna be. But it sure was a good movie! All the actors did a great job, especially an unrecognizably young Al Pacino! Basically Don Vito, the godfather, dies and his son Michael (Pacino) takes over the family business to get revenge on those against his father and those killing off his family. Great ending! I am expecting more out of Part II cauz everyone says it is the best one. See this movie, it is a great mob story!",positive
A obra-prima do cinema.,positive
i like this movie first for the my faivorat actor al patcino and the strongest of the film,positive
"Perfection in every way. It is a visually captivating film with a grand story to accompany it. Marlon Brando gave a flawless performance as Don Corleone, resulting in a sympathetic crime lord. Al Pacino gave just as strong of a performance, giving you a clear sense of downfall from a seemingly moralistic character into a ruthless businessman. The story covers everything from family values to revenge. It is perhaps the most epic narrative in cinema.",positive
Everything a movie should be.,positive
the original gangster flick,positive
Though a great film it feels that it takes to long to get into and hard to keep wanting to watch with the hip of the film only when someone gets shoot.,negative
A big bow as my tribute to this great cinema!,positive
The greatest film of all time.,positive
"How can you review a movie like ""The Godfather""? It's just too good!",positive
A little long-winded,negative
One of the most technically flawless movies ever.,positive
"the best film ever... after i watch the trilogy i bought the novel also.. ""I'm Gonna Make Him an Offer He can't refuse"" -Do Corleone to bonasera",positive
"Epic. Simply epic. Francis Ford Coppola, you are officially tied with Hitchcock as my favorite filmmaker of the 20th century. Nothing about this movie is off the mark. Acting-crazy good. Direction-crazy good. Fake Italian accents-cool, and crazy good. If you haven't seen this movie, I will sue you when my attorney comes back from business. ACTING-172/100 DIRECTION-145/100 ACCENTS-122/100 VISUALS-155/100 But I can only go as high as 100 for my tomatometer, so I'll give it a 100! 2 THUMBS UP, WAY UP!",positive
Classic! A must have for anyones movie collection.,positive
"I decided to get through the trilogy in a week and, clearly this is a fantastic opener. It was the third time I had seen it, so it had a comforting, familiar feel. What struck me most was the classic style of direction. Coppola was young and relatively inexperienced but handled the characters and plot brilliantly, and gave us some really beautiful visuals. I also think that Pacino is at his best here in the middle part of the film where he has to step up and take control.",positive
"I've been to see a lot of classic showings and none have gripped the audience as well as this - 37 years on and its one of the best cinema-experiences ive had, despite seeing it countless times on DVD.",positive
Classic!!! need I say more,positive
The classic story of crime and family. Its saga lives on to this day.,positive
"This is the quintessential mobster movie. The first to depict the members of the mafia as real flesh-and-blood people. As horrible as the deeds they commit are in its own twisted way they are understandable. This film is the first chapter in the story of Michael Corleone's rise and fall, detailed in the subsequent two movies. Marlon Brando's performance is also excellent.",positive
"one or possibly The best movie of all time,love it.master piece",positive
Hadn't seen this since I was a kid. Pretty sure I liked it more now. Almost a complete movie in all ways.,positive
IT's wat most men wuld like to say..LEGEN-wait 4 it.........DARY....i wish i got to speak those dialougues,positive
"All wisdom comes from the Godfather''..the quote to remember time to time. Its not possible for me to make a classy or satisfactory review of this movie, and I don't have the courage to do that 2.But I can say, the experience is once in a lifetime, and I am glad That I found that enjoying this movie. No matter how much days pass by, the appeal of this movie would never be paled for a little bit, and yet to say,I m a psychotic fan of this movie.Normally we see that the novel is better than the adaptation or the adaptation surpass the novel, but this is the rarest case where it is told that the novel and the adaptation are the compliment to each other.This movie haunts me in my dream ! The best movie ever that can be made by mankind !!",positive
Muuuito foda!! Esse sim Ã© um filme de mafia,positive

one of the best movies ever made.,positive
I consider this movie the greatest achievement in movies yet!!! Truly amazing!! Marlon Brando was fantastic as well as Pacino!! Three thumbs way up!!,positive
"What a joy to finally see on the big screen. A great film with some brilliant performances. Al Pacino shines on his journey from golden boy war hero to ruthless monster mafia boss Michael Corleone. Iconic scenes (horses head in the bed), stunning scenery in Scicily to brutal killings (Luca Brazi in the bar) The film has everything to keep you glued for the full 3 hours. And Godfather 2 is even better....",positive
"one of the greatest movie I've ever seen, a most see",positive
A guilty pleasure movie that will never die. It displays the bonds of family and shows us a life full of loyalty and living outside the rules of law.,positive
all movies shud be like this,positive
no further comment...,positive
The Godfather is one of the best films I have ever seen.All mafia movies made after this will forever be compared to this classic film.,positive
"The Godfather is the perfect story of organised crime, largely based around the Mafia. One of the best films ever created.",positive
What man doesn't like this series?,positive
"If this isn't the greatest film ever made, it's among the top 5 or ten.",positive
i just love the way al pacino held his character...marlon brando is very talented despite his old age in this movie....,positive

Perhaps the #1 bad ass move of all...,positive

"After hearing about the hype for many years, I finally saw ""The Godfather."" It led up to everything that I expected it would. What comes out is a classic movie of organized crime and mafia. Even though it ends dark and dreary, that's definitely how it should end. Great movie.",positive
"Saw this for the first time a few months ago, I liked it",positive
The Godfather is a pinacle in the movie industry as the movie witch brought us respect.,positive
one of the very best of all times,positive
Great movie my favorite,positive
"I had put off watching this movie for quite some time, as it is not typically my genre of choice, but it honestly is one that you need to experience. Ready for Part II.",positive
"While by most people I am considered a movie nerd and they think I have seen/own every movie ever. This is not true. In fact I have not seen most of what critics call the best films of all time. Citizen Kane, Gone With The Wind, Vertigo, Shawshank Redemption, Saving Private Ryan, American Beatuy....hell I haven't even seen the biggest film of all time itself, Titanic. I usually pretty much stay in the horror/sci fi/action genres. So I have taken it upon myself to start watching these classic films. And you don't get much more classic than The Godfather. Which I found to be a worth watching movie....but it will never make any of my top of all time list. I just don't think I am that huge of a mafia film fan. I didn't think Scarface was all that great either and I have never seen nor do I have much desire to watch Sopranos. That plus so many of the movie has been imitated/parodied over the years that it almost feels like I have seen it before.",positive
Excellent story. Legendary actors abound. This movie is a masterpiece that many movies have copied from since.,positive
"Overrated? Maybe a little bit, but this is really a very well-made film that features wonderful performances. The pacing of this film will drive some crazy, but The Godfather isn't afraid to take its time and let us get to know the characters. This is an iconic movie though - no doubt about that.",positive
An outstanding performance by the legendary Marlon Brando.,positive
"Had to watch this movie for a film class in college and I understand why. One of THE most AMAZING movies ever made. But do yourself a favor and read the book as well, the screenplay follows it almost exactly but the book has ""deleted scenes"" as well :)",positive
.....Just when I thought I was out......they pull me back in......LOL,positive
TOP CLASS movie showing how the Godfather controls everything and solve everything and how is the life of the mafia and how it is full of danger,positive
Le meilleur film jamais fait. Point final. Ã regarder en mangeant une grosse assiettÃ©e de spaghettis le dimanche soir!,positive
one of the greatest of all time!!!,positive
"I can't believe I waited this long to catch this flick. I enjoy ultra-violence in films, especially when the characters are able to deliver a strong, believable story. The pacing is on-point. Storyline-the family ties, challenged then strengthened. It was nuts! I even had dreams about the film later on in the evening. Who doesn't enjoy hardcore gangster films? Get-outtah-here! This one is on the serious tip, and although there are stereotypical representations of Italian mobs (1940's) the story and delivery, filmically and all in between was quite the ride, for about 3 hours. Just my style.",positive
"Terrific film, even if I can't help seeing cotton wool stuffed into Marlon Brando's cheeks, and there is plenty of padding elsewhere by now of course.",positive
"It was alright, but I'm not into gang movies!",negative
I will make you an offer that you can't refuse.,positive
This is a film that elevates the art form. Perfect in every aspect.,positive
"complex Italian American mafia family life, a superb vision of gangland from a personal level courtesy of capolla.",positive
This movie influenced my moral development more than any other.,positive
Undeniably one of the best movies of all time.,positive

A must see for a cinema fan.,positive
You can never go wrong with The Godfather.,positive
say wha! see it again,positive
"Modern pop culture owes so fucking much to this brilliant film! The originating ancestor of all things ""gangsta"". Nuff said.",positive
"The most perfect movie I have ever seen. Epic in almost every way, this is the most perfect crime saga movie I've watched. The acting is superb, the plot is excellent and it comes with one of the most memorable musical scores I have ever heard.",positive
arguably one the greatest flicks ever.,positive
seen it twice now and it holds up. loses the half star for some character motivation that doesn't quite make it to the screen.,positive
"Just great film-making really. From the directing to the story and the acting (especially the acting), everything is top notch. Having said that it is not quite as good as the sequel when Pacino really shines.",positive
Could be the greatest movie ever made. I like the Italy scenes the best. The scene when Micheal has to kill the cop is awesome also. I could go on and on....,positive
"A good movie, but extremely over-rated. A very good cast and very good performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, overall, a classic gangster movie.",positive
What a cast. This is what a 5-star film looks like!,positive
this is a super excellent movie to watch.better own it.,positive
"I get more Sopranos references now. I can't say much that hasn't already been said, the acting being the highlight. The low point being the twat of a man in the cinema ruining it for everyone else.",negative
"Love the godfather movies , have all 3 of em!",positive
the best Godfather series,positive
Oh I remember watching this when I was quite young and I enjoyed it very very much! Definitely one of the best movie ever made.,positive
best gangster movie ever!!,positive
"If you haven't seen, watch it. It really is that good.",positive
"Nearly perfect, Godfather II is a better film.",positive
"So <i>The Godfather</i> is widely considered the greatest film of all time. I finally gave in and decided to invest three hours of my life to watching this film. I won't say that I'm disappointed by the film, in fact, the more I think about it the more I enjoy it. But I don't think it is the greatest film of all time. I do think it has been labeled ""the greatest film of all time"" for such a long time that most people, after viewing it, feel the need to go along with popular culture. If you look at a lot of the reviews then I think my theory is backed up. Most people just state how it is a ""classic"" or ""the first in the genre that stands the test of time"", you know, standard cliched responses - how you are supposed to respond after viewing it. Well, I <b>do</b> think this is a great film, for the most part - but no sir, not the greatest of all time. I am going to assume that if you are reading this then you have seen the film. In fact I think I was the last person on earth who hadn't seen it. So, there is no real need to explain the plot, but I do want to talk about how the plot's structure aids and hinders the film. This film, at its core, is about the transition of power within the most notorious mafia family in the U.S. - the Corleones. The film can be broken down in several key scenes that make us understand why this is a great film. After recently seeing <i>Good Luck Chuck</i> for a second time, I realized how terrible most of the films being put out today are. This, I think, makes <i>The Godfather</i> stand out even more. These are dramatic scenes we are viewing in which the acting and cinematography <b>make this film</b>. Not montage-filler scenes that act as a way to progress the story. This film takes its time and is very deliberate in its scenes. Take the first scene for example. Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) is the actor playing the Godfather, and when the film opened that is who I saw. By the end of that scene it wasn't Brando anymore, it Don Vito Corleone, the Godfather. Little things he did to show control in that scene, frankly, blew me away. It opens with him stroking a kitten - not in the typical James Bond villain way - but an actor making a choice for the character. In the scene a man is pleading for justice for his brutally raped and mangled daughter, and the ease with which Vito Corleone takes this news is very telling. This is everyday business to him - that is why Brando plays with the cat. To show control and power. The opening scene creates the character that is Vito Corleone. We don't really get to see him as the Godfather for the rest of the film. It is that opening scene that creates the entire understanding of <i>who</i> the Godfather is and <i>what</i> he is capable of. There are so many great actors in this film, three hours doesn't really seem long enough for all of them to share the screen, but because they are all great actors the screen time they do get they take full advantage of. James Cann manages to take a seemingly simple character, Sonny Corleone, and fully flesh him out. I don't see Sonny as just a hot-head. I get a 3 dimensional understanding of Sonny and his role within the family. Everyone plays their characters well and it is due to the fact that they are all great actors, but also because of the <b>main</b> character - the family. The family is everything in this film. It tells the actors how to play their roles. It is what drives the plot. It is what makes Michael. Now earlier I stated the the structure of the scenes is what makes and breaks this film. There is so much tension in almost of the scenes it is almost unbearable. It is tension with cinematography, setting, lighting, and acting relieved by quick violent outbursts - but they are never fully relieved. The scene in which Michael (Pacino) decides to take revenge for his father and kill the cop and drug dealer is simply fantastic. We know what is supposed to happen, but we don't know if it is going to happen. Coppola directs this amazingly and Pacino's acting is superb. When he goes to get the gun from the toilet we are anticipating seeing if the gun is there and if the plan will be carried out - and if it isn't how is Michael going to respond. We know his sole intention is to kill them, not bow down to their wishes, but what will he do if the gun isn't there? How will he react? These questions arise because we never see Michael actually get the gun. We see him reach for it, but we never physically see the gun. That coupled with how Michael reacts before re-entering the restaurant keeps that tension all the way until he quickly and unexpectedly shoots them. Tension relieved by quick violent outbursts. There are so many scenes that are fantastic and the tension created I actually felt. The only problem that I really had with they film was when Michael was in hiding in Sicily. That entire act seemed like a plot device. A way to show Michael's growth and transition, but it wasn't done as well as the rest of the film. It seemed to obvious, while the rest of the film seemed subtle in how it carried out the plot. It also kinda took me out of the rest of the story. It seemed to break the tension that was the rest of the film. In New York nowhere was safe, and while they tried to get that across here as well - I never felt that anxiety. There was no tension for me in Sicily. And that was my only real qualm with the film. It <b>is</b> a fantastic film. It <b>does</b> have great acting. And it <b>will</b> continue to be considered <b>one</b> of the greatest films of all time. I just don't think it is <b>the</b> greatest film of all time.",positive
"I can't believe it has taken me until I'm nearly 44 to actually see this movie. Very cinematic, but some of the scenes are a little too long-winded. Still, it is nearly as old as me.....it's a classic.",negative
without question one of my top 3 movies of all time.,positive
The true form of Mafia life has been fully realised through this outstanding movie with its top-notch performances.,positive
"The strong cast and the suspense make this the greatest mafia movie ever. I loved how Al Pacino's character, Michael, slowly evolves into his father and James Caan is just great entertainment.",positive
"The Godfather is a close to pefect as a film can get. A legendary cast playing legendary characters. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone is arguably the greatest performance in movie history. Francis Ford Coppola is the only director that could make The Godfather work like it did. The greatest and most real look into the mafia culture ever. Even the smallest of scenes leave an impact and that is what a great movie needs. Jame Caan as Sonny Corleone is one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. Joe Cazale is perfect as the weak willed and minded. Luca Brasi is one of the most famous characters in movie history, yet has one of the briefest roles. Only a truly great film can have a soundtrack that is almost as famous as the actual film. The Godfather paved the way for some of the greatest films and as time goes on just becomes more and more legendary.",positive
My favorite movie of all time.,positive
simply the best gangster film ever,positive
"My top epic movie (trilogy)... GRAND, MASTERPIECE, now for a long time. Lots have come close but never surpassed the whole experience of being a Corleone...",positive
"An epic movie that defied the generation of mobster movies, action movies, crime drama movies and all movies in general. best movie in history all im going to say",positive
awesome to see it on the big screen,positive
i'll have to re-watch this.,negative
Arguably the greatest movie ever made!,positive
Noe av det beste som er laget. Denne filmen skapte hele mafia-sjangern.,positive
My favorite Mob/ganster trilogy!,positive
"The greatest gangster film ever made. As filmmaking and storytelling, âThe Godfatherâ remains a bravura piece of work, its set pieces, dialogue and performances entrenched cinematic icons. With the themes of family and loyalty, this film is a must see for any movie fan.",positive

"Simply put, this is the definitive movie about mob and gangsters in America and it's stunningly written, played and directed. Even if you're not familiar with the whole mob-scene, this a great piece of cinematic excellence. I really can't imagine anyone saying ""I hate this movie"" or ""I thinks it's boring"" because anyone saying that tells me enough of that person's world-view and the attitude towards the whole history and philosophy of cinema.",positive

"I don't get what the big deal is with The Godfather movies. I watched all nine and half hours of it (for the first time) over the past few weeks and I wasn't very impressed. I'll agree that it was probably groundbreaking stuff for back in the early seventies, but these honestly wouldn't even make my top one-thousand, if I were to write one out now. A little bit too Italian for my taste. Too much talk, leading into small events that I wouldn't really classify as ""greatest film in world cinema"" material; like the archives state. I enjoyed all three of them equally no-more than average. In my opinion, there were more cons than pros in regards to rewarding moments within all three of the films.",negative

"Incredible. This movie probably single-handedly saved the American movie industry back in the 70's. I shouldn't even call The Godfather a movie. It is a masterpiece. The storytelling, the character development, the acting, the action, the internal struggles of Michael Corleone, EVERYTHING about this film was just superbly done. If only a movie like this could save us from the trash that's being produced today. And if only Al Pacino could learn to have a little more discretion when picking scripts these days. That guy hasn't made a good movie since Scent of a Woman.",positive

Cannot get any better.,positive
"""The Godfather"" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching ""The Godfather,"" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, ""That's my family, Kay. That's not me."" We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, ""Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever."" That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, ""It's strictly business"" when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a ""cold hearted bastard"" at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like ""The Godfather,"" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.",positive

"I'm not going to be one of these people that just follows the pack and without hesitation give the GodFather 5 stars because I think Casino, Goodfellas, and scareface are better gangster movies. So using those movies as my rating system I'm giving this one one star less.",negative
"With a script based off of Mario Puzo's best seller, the film actually only uses half the book (the other half is used in the sequel, explaining Don Corleone's origins) but is never lacking in epic storytelling. What could have been a small gangster film ends up being this compelling and romantic view of the Mafia during the '40s in New York. Marlon Brando won an Oscar for his role which I feel is not wholly deserved. His performance is absolutely brilliant, don't get me wrong, but Oscar worthy? When the Oscar still meant something? Doubtful. Francis Ford Coppola unveils his film with the patience and intelligence of a much older director (he was around 33 at the time) and gives us one of the greatest films put to celluloid. However, i feel it's not for everyone. My significant other particularly hates it, so I try and have mercy on her as to not watch it too often. I can't say more about this film that hasn't already been said. I feel I must mention, though, Al Pacino's performance. This is before screaming Pacino, and all that over the top rage. Pacino's Michael Corleone is cold, calculating and, quite frankly, often terrifying. He starts off the film seemingly innocent of this crime enterprise but eventually becomes the most ruthless Mafia boss of them all. Very reminiscent of Lucky Luciano in his schemes. A superior film for superior cinephiles.",positive

Not my kind of film in more than one way. Especially storywise. Me and Maffia-ish elements don't go together. I reckon that visually it's absolutely brilliant having in mind when it was done.

"So OK, I'm a little late to the Godfather party. It's pretty much the standard film that the whole world must have watched but, at 25, I've finally joined the real film viewers world. Hallelujah. Anyway, on to business. The Godfather is beautifully written and directed from the word go. I'm not the biggest gangster movie fan either, but the plot sails along effortlessly and smoothly. Brando is incredible, to the accent and in every single word, the perfect mafia Don. Pacino also shows just how awesome he can be - the transformations in his character three hours later are so complete that you'd swear Michael was a different person entirely, especially at the ending, with said metamorphosis complete. No wonder this film is so popular! It drags its audience is kicking and screaming and holds them captive for three of the best minutes you'll ever spend watching a film. Truly spectacular. If you've been residence under a rock like I have... rent, buy, borrow or steal this immediately. Oh, and the Blu-Ray is not necessary but the scenery is that little bit extra gorgeous. That is all.",positive

"After meaning to watch this ""saga"" for years, I've finally been doin' em deliberately a few weeks apart. Trying to take these accepted classics at face value and as movies in their own right, rather than as a slice of a bigger story. The first movie was a strange mix of exactly what I was expecting, as some sequences have been so referenced, parodied or just plain stolen, for other movies and TV shows...with stuff I really wasn't. In a good way, I hasten to add. The Godfather is a sombre, evocative study of family life it struck me, rather than a vicious mafia by numbers opus. We're never told how the family achieved their status, and frankly I didn't much care as the story unfolded, characters and dynamics are fleshed out and the period in history is vividly recreated. The subtlety of the acting from practically everyone on screen makes each character seem so rounded and it's easy to see how Al Pacino become a star following his role as Michael. What shocks there are come as huge, effective and emotional jolts rather than anything gratuitous and to my mind this lifts this film out of the genre it gets lumped in with, into that of genuine drama and responsible storytelling of truth and consequence. The word ""saga"" couldn't be more apt, though it suprised me how much I felt like I was still on the outside looking in, rather than being invited into a confidence and swept along and that is the key to my stopping short of giving this film any more than 4 stars. Where for example, Gone With the Wind, a film 40 years older, is an easy-5. Yes The Godfather is a wonderful film, and a great cinematic achievement but all through it's massive run time I couldn't quite get inside it the way I think Copolla wants me to, or the way I myself wanted to. Scenes felt like they're being ticked off against a run sheet, broken down so specifically from Mario Puzo's original novel that at times coupled with its plodding pace, make it seem almost workman like once the eye starts to take the rich production values for granted( certainly after the halfway mark). Adapting any other media only works to its maximum effect if some flair is injected into proceedings. I feel the director could've done this more so without losing the integrity, if some of the run time.",positive
"What has been said about this movie has been said. What I must say though is that it's essential. If you love storytelling, this is it at it's best. You can either love or hate the characters, but what you feel you feel strongly.",positive
no words to describe this one. just awesome,positive
Perfection at its finest. Mr. Coppola should be proud about how rich it basks in its own brilliance. Everything from cinematography to wardrobe has been accomplished well.,positive
"Undoubtedly the most awesome mob movie ever! A masterpiece in its own right. Though the death scenes for some people look sketchy, hey! that was 1972. They didn't have advanced technology like Hollywood does today. This movie has stood the test of time and will continue to stand for years, decades, centuries to come!",positive
"Not only did this movie fail to meet the expectations everyone's built up, but it was 3 hours long! 3 hours of mediocrity. Am I wrong in denouncing a so-called classic? Am I wrong in calling it a slow-paced, poorly written spectacle of how delusional the people who write these ""Best Movies of All Time"" lists are? Well acted? Perhaps. But there are no other merits to this film, except that it was able to pull a gigantic wool over everyone's eyes, making them actually like this disaster.",negative
"Heard so much about these movies all my life but hadn't ever seen any of them until I watched this one last year. It's good, and has classic lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse""), but I totally don't get all the hype...it didn't make me want to see it again and certainly not memorize every line...but I think that's because gangster movies in general aren't one of my favorite genres.",negative

"Think of something, like an opera or a painting. What's the best one you can think of? The Mona Lisa for example. Acclaimed universally, painted by Leonardo Da Vinci. People call it the greatest painting ever. If that's the case, then The Godfather is the Mona Lisa of cinema. The real masterpiece of movies, the greatest film ever created and the most wonderful piece of art ever done in the cinematical expression. No movie has ever topped this film, though I would say it was matched by Part II but that's arguable, and I don't think a movie ever will. It is, simply as that, the greatest film I have ever scene in my life, and I've seen a lot. And though I still have plenty to see, I don't think there is a possibiliy any of the ones I'll set my eyes on will even be close to this film's greatness. Dare I say, not even the book was as great as the film. The book was good, but nothing excellent, but this movie is beyond excellent, beyond perfect. It accomplishes everything a movie needs to do and does it better. It reached levels of cinema expression not known at the time and not today a film has come close to doing it. The film I would say that came close the most to matching this film's magnificence was Schindler's List by Steven Spielberg about 20 years later in 1993, and yet it was still missing alot to become what this film was, is and always will be: the greatest movie ever done. There is nothing wrong with The Godfather, no mistake, not one single detail, it is perfect. What movies need to be good it has it and goes even farther. The film has everything: excellent performances, sharply perfect direction, a very very powerful script with memorable lines and deep characters, dramatic depth as well as entertainment, a fantastic score, a good dosis of suspense and drama, it contains every ingredient to make any food the greatest you would ever taste. Try and taste of the best spaghetti or soup or whatever you like in this moment. Pleasant. That's what The Godfather is, pleasant, in every possible way. And the performances, breathaking in every sense and as maginificent as any performance can be. This was the film that made Al Pacino, one of the greatest living actors, famous. It was this film that catapulted him into the world of cinema and thanks to this we have the excellent and powerful performances and films he has done through out the course of his career. And his performance was excellent, magestic. He plays Michael Corleone, Vito Corleone's son and future heir, who at first doesn't want to be part of his father's business but he becomes the Don of the family later on. Becoming his character, Al Pacino gave his finest performance ever. Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, Scent of a Woman, none of them were as wonderfully powerful as was his role in The Godfather. Not to say these were bad, on the contrary, they were amazing, I am saying they all came from The Godfather and none of them was as amazing as this was. He mastered his character, he became Michael. He had the air of the sicilian son who doesn't want to become what his father is, but eventually he does, he was perfect for the role and he played it perfectly. Another wonderful player was Robert Duvall, who plays Tom Hagen, Vito Corleone's adoptive son who plays the role of consiglieri and lawyer to the family. As Al Pacino, Robert Duvall was incredible in his role of Tom Hagen. Organized, kind and with a good heart, but very loyal to his adoptive father and his brothers. He perfectly acted the part. And of course we have James Caan. He plays the role of Sonny Corleone, Vito Corleone's hot headed and temperamental son who has the ambition to become heir of his father's legacy. Another wonderful performance we have here. He suitted perfectly the role of Sonny. Every scene he lost his temper, screamed at someone or beated somebody up, he was in his character, never stepping out of it. But I left Marlon Brando for last. Marlon Brando, Vito Corleone, the monarch of the Corleone crime family. You know it, you've heard about it, one of the greatest performances in the history of film. It certainly is. He mastered his character, he became Don Vito, he became the powerful but good hearted Don Corleone. From expressions to his voice, he was amazing. This was his very best performance, and the best performance in the film. Yes, I do think he was better than Pacino or Caan or Duvall. His performance was very powerful and excellently played. Don Corleone. This film could not have been possible without the careful directorial eye of Francis Ford Coppola. The architecture of the film, its structure, its whole being is attributed to him. Like buildings are attributed to its architecters, this film is attributed to its director. The direction was flawless, absolutely perfect. He captured the essence of the gangster world, he directed the actors to the wonderful performances they all played, he set the mood for the whole film. He made the film, crafted it from the script to the screen. Extraordinary direction. It is a sad thing that he couldn't do it again, direct so perfectly, with the exception of Part II of course. He directed many films, but none was directed so incredibly. Not even Apocalypse Now, which is probably the greatest war film. And the script. There is no flaw at the script. Perfect, a word that I've used alot through out this review but it is the ""perfect"" way to describe it, perfect. Excellently written, it does not only contain the action the characters do, but also the dialogues and the characters themselves. The characters, many would end up on a list of the greatest of all time. Don Vito was amazingly done, and his sons were too. Sonny Corleone can be the greatest hot head in a movie, and the best example for character developement in a film lie with Michael Corleone. And the dialogues have become iconic. With the great line that characterises the film, ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"", and many others, for example ""One day, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a favor for me, but until that day accept this as a gift"" or ""I believe in America"", and a very key and important one for the series ""That's my family Kay, its not me"", the dialogues have been matter of praise. Another thing that deserves acclaim is the film's amazing score. Composed by Nino Rotta, with excellent sound of classical music, it is unbelievably beautiful. Actually, the whole time I've been writing this review I've been playing the song over and over again to get the mood of the film, and of course to delight my ears. I respect a film that accomplishes what it tries to do, and The Godfather does more than that. Its goal was making gangsters look human, in a different way from how many gangster films of the 40s and 50s made them look, like cruel and heartless animals, but this film wanted to make them human, and it did far more than that: it made the audience sympathize with them, care about them, and maybe even love them. Ah The Godfather. Say the word masterpiece and this film is the first to come to my mind. It is perfect in every possible way. It is breathaking. The first time I saw this I was blown away, and I've seen it like a hundred more times and I still get my mind blown. You think Inception is mindblowing, this film is more for how excellent it is. This film is an achievement, an accomplishment rarely seen in cinema, and certainly never seen today. It is the best film of all times, there is no doubt about that. You want to see the greatest film of all times? See this, not Citizen Kane not Casablanca not Seven Samurai, this, The Godfather. And all of those films were also masterpieces for their time, but this is for cinema history. You'll never see a film more perfect than this. This is, without a doubt, definitely and absolutely, the greatest cinematic masterpiece.",positive

You don't have to be Italian to relate to the huge family aspect of this movie. I don't think it glorifies the mafia, I think the opposite actually. Everyone ends up dead literally and figuratively. The thing that I like the most about this movie is that it reminds me of my Gramo more than anything. She is the biggest inspiration in my life, and her love for this movie taught me that it was ok to like violent things and still be a good person. It made me want to make movies, because of how much she loved them. I wanted to make what I saw her love so much. A movie with a good plot, that you can relate to, with the balls to be real...",positive

"The perfect movie. A story that never gets old. The adaption to Mario Puzo's bestselling novel is deserving of it's title as one of the greatest. A cast to remember, dialogue that leaves us shivering, The Godfather fills every hole in what the viewer wants to see. Throughout the film, we see the mafia life being praised, and it sinks in as success and what we all really want, but right when we have fallen in love with the idea, here comes a problem that leaves everyone shaken up, bringing us back to the realization that life in crime is still evil.",positive
Master-piece. Thats one word to describe it. Considering the 70's era that the movie was made. I always wondered the technique and filming development back in 70's. Its a movie I am sure would have changed at the time the way story has to be narrated and directed. Coming to performances. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are simply superb going to skin of the characters to portray Godfather. And great supporting cast. A true masterpiece. And will always remain my all-time favorite.,positive

Te haré una oferta que no puedas reusar, son una de tantas fraces grandiosas en la vida de la familia Corleone, una de las mas grandes peliculas de mafia en la historia de séptimo arte, con la actuación de Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, entre otros, una pelicula bastante recomendable.",positive
"100/100. A film I can watch over and over again. Believe it or not, I never watched this movie until about a year ago and I'm 28 years old. Despite not seeing the movie, it felt very familiar when watching it because I've heard so many of the lines before in other movies or parodies- even seen a Super Bowl commercial parodying the horsehead in the bed. This movie has such a classy look to it and makes you like the family, despite them being mobsters. It takes more than one watch to catch everything. My first watch over was a bit much- it was difficult for me to understand all of the intricisies of the movie and who each character was, but I actually like that they didn't dummy the movie down for us. You understood the main plot lines and where the film was going when you first watch it, but having more things to look for on your second viewing makes the film even richer. Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone character was awesome. His voice, the respect that he commanded by everybody in the movie and you really got the feeling that he was a ""classy"" mob boss because of his reluctance to get into the drug business side of things even though it was a guaranteed gold mine. He wanted to conduct his business with respect and never wanted young Michael Corleone to get into the ""family business"". Michael was a smart one and could have made a better life for himself. Even after Michael was getting involved into the family business towards the end, he was promising his NY woman that he would clean up the family business and make it legit, not keep it as a crime family. Michael Corleone's character was quietly the spotlight stealer. So many great actors doing a great job in this, but Michael's character was the standout in my eyes. A flip switched in his mind when his father was gunned down- his scene in front of the hospital pretending to have a gun in his coat while the rival mobsters drove by was classic because Michael was steady as a rock while the other guy (the butcher I believe?) was as shaky as one could be. Absolutely loved the scene when he did his first murder in the restaurant. You really felt the tension in the room. Were they suspicious that he was up to something? All of Sicily was a great section of the movie too. He went after the woman he wanted and when he realized that his ""friend"" there crossed him and rigged the car to blow up killing his new wife, you felt it. The scenery in Italy was awesome- as was the whole classic look of New York City. This movie had classic scenes such as the cut scenes during the baby's christining in which all of the mob bosses were killed (funny that the baby boy was Sophia Coppola) and especially the very last scene- when Michael Corleone was being crowned the new Don. No words were necessary there to make that scene very effective. Even the way the movie opened was awesome- with that narrative and then you realize that it's a guy asking Don Vito Corleone for help. There is no better barometer of how good a movie is and how well you enjoy it than whenever you are looking for a dvd to watch from your collection, you constantly contemplate watching the Godfather- even if you just watched it a couple weeks ago.",positive
Saw it all so many years ago. Still a great film.,positive
genius...that is all one can really say about it,positive
"One of the all-time best movies... if you haven't seen it go rent it, NOW!",positive
"""I Believe In America"" Then It All Begins. The Godfather in my eyes is the greatest motion picture of all time. The first time I seen this it was my favourite and it has never not been the best in my opinion. The casting is absolutely perfect, Marlon Brando gives one of his best or maybe even his best performance of all time as The Godfather Vito Corleone. Al Pacino plays the part of Michael excellant aswell, I think Part II is the one where he steals the show but nevertheless this performance but him on the road to stardom. The plot is very realistic and based on the real life five families and tries to show you have mafia families operate with different levels of authority and respect which had never been done before, Well at least I don't think. The Godfather will always be remembered and will always be on the top 100 of all time lists, Always in the top 5 and that is for a reason. Everything is perfect and there aren't very many films you can say that about: The characters, dialogue, the score, screenplay. Amazing!",positive

"The best mafia movie ever made,and a cinema masterpiece.Based on the 1969 novel by Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay by Puzo, Coppola and an uncredited Robert Towne.The Godfather, along with the other films in the trilogy, had a strong impact on the public at large. Don Vito Corleone's line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" was voted as the second most memorable line in cinema history in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute.Coppola inspirates himself in the family to direct this movie.The performances are anthological and the music is work of genius.",positive
"Great story, memorable one-liners, great performances all around, and of course the epic clean-out at the end. A masterpiece!",positive
""" im gona make him an offer he cant refuse"" the imortal words of don corleone live on in pop culture from this classic peaice of cimena. its hard not to find anything wrong with this movie. God this is the ultamie film about the mafia with great acting from Al Pacino , Robert Duvall and of course the godfather himself Marlin Brando. The plot is groundbreaking in orgianlty with michaels fall from grace into the family bisssnes. enought said 100/100 ( the second part follows with the sucefful formula of the first)",positive

"To review something seems at first a simple job. You are offered something up, in the form of a dish, a painting or a film, any art form. Next you use two skills which most Human beings posses, thinking and writing. You then just write about what you think of it. Unfortunately it is not as easy as it seems, not quite paid to eat, it is a hard difficult intellectual process. Comparing and analysing every last detail you see before writing another art form. This is topped off by the fact that no reviewer is allowed to like something and then next week not like something there must be a clear pattern. But there is hope. The Godfather. It is a film that cannot be explained in beautiful shakespearian language but just can be said one of the best films in history. This is where the reviewer may take a break and just say with a sense of knowing and fact that everyone agrees on. Everyone has a feeling that this is the best film in the world. And if everyone has teh same sure feeling then it must be right. ***** 5 Star",positive

saw it after i read the book. really good stuff :),positive
superb you cant really add anything else,positive
"The Greatest Film. The best film by Coppola. The best crime film. The best film adapted from a novel. The Godfather is entertaining. You have great acting, characters with different personalities and charisma of their own: Sonny, Tom, Vito, and of course Michael. You have one great casting with amazing performances and sincerely, every minute of Godfather is worth to be called a classic. Some say it's boring and disappointing, I say they didn't get the movie when they watch it, but the more they watched the film, the more they went into the plot, the characters, the story, the whole atmosphere of the movie, and they finally understood the truth about The Godfather.",positive

an offer i couldn't refuse,positive
Al Pacino is one of my all time role models. There is a saying I grow up with âyour word is your bondâ The Godfather is a treasure and perhaps ironic that I learned the meaning of loyalty and trust in this movie and perhaps good that betrayal in real life is not dealt with in the same way. Who knows perhaps that was a simpler time?,positive
the best movie ever!!!!!,positive
"master piece, become a fan of al Pacino",positive
What can I say that hasn't already been said? Excellence.,positive
A masterpiece. Crime portrayal at its best. Marlon Brando and the rest pull off a stunning feat here; they set the tone for the gangster movie genre.,positive
"★★★★ (out of four) Without a doubt amongst the greatest of all motion pictures. Marlon Brando is Don Corleone in what may be his best performance. The film works on every level and still remains as potent today. The saga of the Corleone family and their rise in the mob world is the quintesential American story. At first it seems as though Vito Corleone is the central character, but it soon becomes clear that young and comparably innocent Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is really the one to follow. A struggle for supremacy with rival mob families has dragged the Corleone's unwlllingly into a turf war, so to speak. When an attempt is amde on the life of Vito, the sons step to the forefront. Filled with iconic moment after moment, it is still just as powerful and memorable today as I'm sure it was when it came out in 1972. One of the true masterpieces of american cinema.

this is my most favorite movie of all time. I can say all of the words !~,positive
"One of the best films ever. After winning an oscar for Patton, Francis Ford Coppola became notable in Hollywood. The Godfather, Francis Ford's masterpiece, places him on the map as a respectable director. The direction was great by Coppola and the adapted screenplay by Coppola and Puzo was amazing. The wedding scene in the beginning introduces the characters and shows their importance. Don Vito Correlone (Brando) is by far the most respected character in this movie. This is shown in the beginning during the wedding of his daughter when follow Sicilians pay their respects to him and asking for favors. Vito shows a moral life when he feels disrespected when a family friend decided to go to the police first. He also shows moral when he is against drugs because it's a crime with victims. Michael Corelone (Pacino) who is Don Vito's youngest son seems to be a nice and noble kid especially when he is treated like a war hero and seem to be a protagonist. Michael seems to not be interested to be a part of the ""business"" but later on it seems like he was force to. Towards the end of the film when Michael lies to his sister and wife and closes door on his wife it seemed like it was the beginning of a new villain within Michael. Sonny (Caan) who is Don Vito's eldest son seems to be the next Don. However, he has his flaws especially being known as short-tempered and eager. He flaws would soon affect him and the chances of becoming the next Don. The middle child which seems to be the least important one is Fredo. Fredo (Cazale) is the child that seems not to gain any respect from anyone within the family. He is also known as the ""weak"" one within the family. Tom Hagen (Duvall) who is the Don's adopted son is the right hand man for the family and he is the brains for them with all of the connections. The only daughter in the family is Connie (Shire), she is nice and tired of the mafia life and she is extremely gullible. She marries an abusive person but is gullible enough to stay with him and defend him. Kay (Keaton) who is Michael's girlfriend gets pushed around starting when Michael says he would never get involved with his families work but as we all know this isn't true. Michael's work for the family slowly tears apart his relationship with Kay. The ending of the film can easily be considered the greatest with Michael becoming the ""Godfather"" in two different ways. This movie shows the life of a Mafia man, the scary and painful times. The acting by the whole cast with the likes of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Cazale, Keaton, and Shire was amazing and was one the best of performances by them in their careers. Brando himself put up one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. Pacino has his best performance in his career which also starts it off.",positive
"First movie to break the whole 'do-not-show-too-much-blood-on-screen rule'... The epic scene of the horse's head in the bed! And of course: I'll give him an offer he can't refuse... etc, etc, etc, etc....",positive
"It deserves its reputation. Excellent story, acting and directing. Every performance is awesome and the movie does not lose it's narrative focus once in its entire three hour length.",positive
Read the book. It's more enthralling.,negative
"Is there any doubt that the Godfather is a 10 out of 10 film, in my opinion there is absolutely no debate. The acting is incredible at worst, the story is consistently interesting and really kept me entertained during its near 3 hour run time. I don't know what to say about this film that no-one hasn't already said. The Godfather really is one of the best films ever made, and anyone that doesn't agree really has no respect of the art of film.",positive
"Needless to say more, ""classic"" piece of work in crime genre. Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are geniuses of 20th century's big screens.",positive
"What is to be expected of the best movie of all time. Slow, moving plot. Subtle direction. Deep drama. Excellent dialog. Perfect acting. And so many characters with unconventional names you lose track of who's who.",positive
There isn't much to say about this film that hasn't already been said. It's a classic.,positive
1 of best 4rm hollywood,positive
"Boring... it seems like nothing happens in two hours, then at the end you discover that everything's changed and you ask how so much could be so boring... also, there is almost no sympathy created for the characters, save that scene in the tomato garden- which was the only good scene.",negative
The people who admire this movie do so blindly. Of course the movie is not bad its just not amazing. Many critics simply condemn those who argue this isn't the greatest thing of all time. Acting is good overall but its all cliche to be honest. The cinematography is the movies saving grace though.,negative
"mob movies ""the saprano""",positive
I hate all the violence.,negative
"classic, thats it, there isn't any flaws.",positive
"Ca se traine un peu vers la fin du passage en Sicile, et la mort de l'excellent JAMES CAAN, mais LE PARRAIN reste un classique du cinema ou tout est maitrise, du scenario a la mise en scene qui soulignent le ridicule des rituels mafieux, tout en restant passionnant. La premiere heure et demie est magistrale, le reste un peu moins.",negative
"Finally the time has come to say a few words about The Godfather. People say Coppola's masterpiece is a timeless classic. Is it? Or are people just blinded by the great reviews and amazing resonance it has recieved? I think the answer is: both. This movie is definitely a classic. It shows these unusual stories the way noone has seen before. But still I'm afraid that people watch this movie with the intention of ""watching a masterpiece"" - whatever may come. I tried to watch it as if I didn't know the story and I tried to get into the movie as far as possible. There were parts when it had me. Some scenes are really worth of calling it a masterpiece. There is the legendary scene in the beginning, or the scene in the restaurant where Michael kills his two opponents. Other scenes, however, I found very long and therefore boring. That was an actual problem I had with the movie - its lenght. I think there are a couple of subplots (eg the whole Italian scenes) which are unnecessary. They distract from the main action - the rise of Michael Corleone - and just confuse the viewer. I think the ending is also a bit weak. It ends more with a cliffhanger than with a moral bomb (which I expected). Nonetheless, doubtless classic, superb directing and one performance people will NEVER forget. Still I give this movie 22 out of 30 points. It was a little bit boring, the cinematography was quite monotonous and the ending somewhat weak.",positive
Pure perfection. The standard to which I compare all other movies.,positive
"The Godfather sets a landmark in american cinema, a timeless classic imitated time and time again.The Godfather starts the then young and new to the business Al Pacino and already hardened veteran Marlon Brando, as the film tells the story of the Corleone family, although the film tends to focus more on Al Pacino's character Michael Corleone.It basically revolves around the family's rise to claim NY.As they rage wars with other family's who want nothing more than to see Don Corleone dead.This movie is what sky rocketed Al Pacino fame and made him a true acting legend.The performances given in this film are probably the best of any film ever made.One of the greatest films of all time can not be said enough for this Golden Cinematic film crafted by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo.Simply put if you don't like this film then just give up!Go knitt a sweater!Your movie watching days are over.Now answer the Don's request and watch this movie or you better watch your back....less you be whacked.",positive

Marland Brando and Al Pacino show why they are the CEO's of acting in this movie. James Cann and Diane Keaton show why they are also bosses in this film. I find something new everytime I watch this movie(which has been alot). The Godfather in my opinion is the greatest story ever told. The movie keeps me intrigued and interested ever time I watch it from beginning to end. It's an American classic and probably the greatest movie ever filmed. Francis Ford Coppola directed this movie to greatness.,positive

"My god, have I misjudged this masterpiece! The Godfather is not only the ultimate gangster film, but a landmark for cinema in general. The plot is very well-constructed. Everything that happens in the film is explained through well-written and well-delivered dialogue, and it's so smooth that I honestly could not spot a single hole. There are also many dramatic plot twists, some of which have even remained famous to this day. I also love the style this film went for, mainly with the lighting. The lights often come down on the characters' heads, and the way they established it on the setting is also pretty artistic. The performances are not only elegant, but also subtle and believable. Marlon Brando is the one people remember the most. He IS The Godfather. Just the sound of his voice makes him perfect for the part. All of this unique drama is backed up by one of the most dramatic scores I have ever heard. I know I might not have done this film full justice, but that would be the accomplishment of the century. Just about everyone can agree that this is a must-see for any cinema buff.",positive

It doesn't have any flaw, and probably the best highlight is its cast with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, etc. etc. etc., all of them shine thru the movie and make this (too) long film most enjoyable despite the extreme length. With two worth viewing sequels (specially Godfather II with the majestic Robert De Niro), The Godfather is best saga in history of movies, much, but much more than Star Wars. The one and only classic in movie history, the best of all times that can never be beaten.",positive

"A classic movie which time hasn't diluted its appeal or charm. A film that deals with the issues of family as much as the hierarachy of the mafia organisation. Al Pacino's slow descent from college boy/war hero into the cold calculating don who takes over his father's mantle is believable and mesmerising. All the acting is first class with memorable cinematic moments such as the horse's head and the baptism/massacre crossover. A director on his game, a cast to die for. Brilliant score and a slow sedate movie which its narrative slowly unfolds never losing the audience.",positive

Awesome....! Truly a master piece... !,positive
"I would consider this movie the best crime drama ever produced. It has every element you would ever look for in a crime drama: Violence,Sex, and the desire to make lots of cash. You could not have created a better cast for this movie, Al Picino. James Caan and Marlon Brando make it seem easy. But there is one very minor problem i have with this masterpiece. I did not like how Coppola took out the whole story about Johnny Fontane after he got the job, it was my favorite part of the book. That aside, me and many others consider this the movie that all other epic crime dramas must be compared to.",positive
The Godfather of all the best of the series,positive
Noen filmer gÃ¥r aldri av moten. Francis ford coppolas The godfather er en av dem. Mesterlig av en av vÃ¥r tids stÃ¸rste filmskapere. Toppkarakter,positive
Fantastic masterpiece,positive
Possibly the greatest movie ever made.,positive
"Well, it's The Godfather so there's not much to talk about here but just a few notes i wanted to say about THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. The movie's success was mainly -for me- because of an entire cast.. there was no hero in The Godfather.. there's no single scene you could have neglected or forwarded without your consciousness hurting you :D ... every actor, every setting, every line was exactly executed as it was supposed to be, normal and flawless. Another thing was the timing of the movie where there were actual mafias still in the US. So to do such a daring movie was something to be respected. There's nothing actually to be said about The Godfather. If you could count the good things that your mother did for you across the years, then you can count the good things about The Godfather.",positive
Do we actually need a comment here ? Maybe - read the book .. too,positive

One of the best films ever made anywhere. It is a timeless classic and i can see it a 1000 times over (already done so about half of that number)!,positive
What can I say...It's a classic!,positive
"This is my all-time favorite movie. Fantastic acting, an amazing storyline and script, and phenomenal directing. I really can't stress how amazing this film is and how much of an impact it has made on my views of films, and the film industry all together. I know this is nowhere near a detailed review, but this is really something you should just see for yourself. I highly recommend it,",positive
"Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give excellent performances, but the story really drags at times. There are a few excellently executed scenes which are very good. It's possible after all the constant hype my expectations were too high, but this wasn't the genius masterpiece I was expecting and hoping for. Disappointed.",positive
"I feel obligated to say if you DO NOT like this movie you will IN FACT be SLEEPING with THE FISHES....The reason for saying that is because this is arguably the greatest film ever made!.. I guarantee you will not look away form the screen. Brando, Caan, and Pacino will rock your world. Pacino's role in the film goes from innocent man just out of the ARMY trying to make an honest living to the most feared man in the country....Oscar worthy for sure but noone could have topped Brando that year.",positive
I actually wish it was longer.,positive
"My friend, guitar teacher and mentor 24+ Grammy Award winnder Carmine D'Amico not only played on the soundtrack but appeared in the movie playing Mandolin. A great honour for a Italian/American!",positive
My favorite movie of all time. Absolutely fantastic on every level.,positive
"The most famous film ever made. I don't really know what to say about this film because it has received so much praise and everything good about the film has been said, so I'll just say this is one of the greatest films ever made.",positive
"The Godfather: 8.1/10 Excellent cast, great story, contains the best movie line EVER, but it's not the best movie of all time. It has some career-making performances from Pacino and Caan, and an excellent performance from the always fantastic Marlon Brando. But it has it flaws. I mean come on, it's way, way, way too long. I know it has a lot to show, but some parts just felt unneeded, and I actually turned it off the first time I tried, and watched the rest the next day. Also, it has three stories in one. One about Michael, one about Vito, and one about Sonny, and they never really link together. So, Impressive movie, yes. Best movie ever, go Forrest Gump.",positive
"Wow, what a movie. This movie has everything a person would like to watch in a movie. Entertainment, Drama, Emotions and Story. To say that this movie put Hollywood back on the track(if they ever slipped from one) would be an understatement. I've never heard so much praises for any other movie in the history of film-making. This movie is probably the only movie to rank at the top of the list in every movie fanatic's list. Long Live..........Francis Ford Coppola who masterfully directed this Masterpiece.",positive
The reason I like gangsters. Movie that put Pacino on the map. You think there is a better one out there? Forget about it.,positive
"The defining movie of Francis Ford Coppola's career, ""The Godfather"" is a guys movie. Never before had a movie looked so closely into the mob that we are right there when deals go down. When hits are made. Riveting, powerful and epic, this movie won OscarsÂ© for many reasons. Pacino gives the performance of a lifetime with Marlon Brando ringing in a second encore. Violent and no holding back, this movie is the ultimate mob movie that should be watched every now and then to honor its greatness.",positive
den beste av alle gangsterfimer. ever!,positive
One of the best movie of all times.,positive
"""I'm gonna make him an offer he won't refuse."" Ok, what can I say about this one. Well, it's The Godfather. It's the movie of movies. And it's freaking amazing. The acting here is one of the best ever, one of the many strongest points of the film. The soundtrack is remarkable, the story is so beautifully told that you can notice every aspect of Michael's progress. And Marlon Brando just gives a legendary performance, well suited for a legendary movie. Deserves all the praise it receives.",positive
My alltime favorite!!!,positive
"Strong story-line, strong character, enjoyable theme songs!",positive
The Godfather... Period!,positive
"Absolute classic, very classy and well directed film",positive
"While the technology is nothing compared to todays standards, the plot and character development is so well done that its easy to forget the unrealistic blood. The langauge is not as bad as Scarface, and their isn't as much action as The Matrix, but the general theme around the whole movie( Mafia) is quite disturbing. Hands down the best move iv'e ever seen",positive

"Let Micky handle it,,,",positive
"If they would make an award for the best movie EVER, this movie will be the only one to get it",positive
Maybe my favorite movie ever. Who hasn't seen this like 300 times since TNT became a network?,positive
THIS MOVIE IS THE SICKEST,positive
"The film is, no doubt, a classic. It must be seen by everyone. It is the original mob gangster movie. What else is there to say about The Godfather? Everything has already been said.",positive

"cualquier enemigo de mis amigos, es también mi enemigo.",positive
"An epic movie, yet to meet anyone who contest that this is the best movie of all times. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino giving performances of lifetime. It doesn't get better than this. 15 on 10",positive
"Many classic movies consider themselves to be the best, but I believe the only one that actually deserves that title is The Godfather. The Godfather is so good, because everything is just wonderful. Everything, the cast was great, the settings were unique and look like were actually from the time period at which the movie takes, and the directing is just..........awesome. This is movie I'll find hard to not like, because I think this movie is just to good to not like. My favorite thing about the whole movie though, is Al Pacino's Performance, his performance in this movie is my all time favorite performance I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I love his performance in The Godfather Part II, but not as much as I did for in this movie. I think the reason is because in this movie his character was far more interesting. He was more interesting because he didn't have great power yet, in Part II his the Godfather, he has great power now. I find a character who is working his way up to power to be more interesting then someone who already has power. I also felt that Pacino's character to be the main character, not the actual Godfather. But Marlon Brando's performance as the Godfather is VERY close second, on my list of favorite performance. He truly deserved that Academy Award, and Pacino should have gotten an Academy Award for his role in this movie. He didn't even get one in The Godfather Part II, he wouldn't get an Oscar until for Scent of a Women, a movie I'm hoping to see one day soon. Oh, did I also mention the music. The music is so wonderful, it's probable one of my favorite movies scores ever. There is only one thing I didn't like, one thing, THE BEGINNING. The beginning was sooooooooooooooooooo boring, not essential bad, but movie didn't get me interested until they had the head of horse. But despite that, this movie is truly a masterpiece. 5/5",positive
I just saw this for the first time last night! WOW,positive
What can I say - a classic!!!,positive
"Luca Brasi: Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child",positive
"Everything you hear about ""The Godfather"" for the most part is correct. It truly is a masterpiece and truly is an american classic. Not only does ""The Godfather"" display amazing acting from Brando to Pacino, but it is the gold standard when it comes to gangster/mob films. Actually, I take that back. It is the gold standard of making films in general. As adapted from the novel of the same name, ""The Godfather"" is an epic film that chronicles the fall and rise of the Corleone family, as hostility increases from other families in the mob world and drugs start to mutate the underpinnings of the mob business. Ofcourse, the cross fire between mob families and the business side are the base on Coppola's canvas. What is far more intriguing is Francis Ford Coppola's wonderful balancing act as he is able to capture the many themes and ideas that run through Mario Puzo's crime saga that range from honor and the ideal of family. More specifically, Coppola is able to develop and push his actors to create not only multi-dimensional characters, but also relateable human beings. Soon, as the film briskly moves along, we are no longer an outsider looking in. We are engulfed in not only the mafia world, but also the Corleone family. Even more importantly though, Coppola gets us to view mobsters or crime families in a new light. Our initial reaction is that we're watching unreasonable and violent people in a destructive world. Yet Coppola and company do something quite grand; they change our view. We now see the family consisting of reasonable and honorable people as they work their way through a vicious (and at times) violent world. Of course as we come to know, violence is never the goal of the Corleone family, but merely a tool to keep a balance. Such a notion is what makes ""The Godfather"" such a fantastic film. Also, it doesn't hurt that the film boasts astounding production values from the beautiful cinematography to the terrific score. Although I personally can't name ""The Godfather"" as the greatest film ever ( there a lot of films I haven't seen), but if someone asked me if its one of the greatest, I can't help but gleefully say ""yes.""",positive

"One of the Original Gangster/Mafia films, to me its a Classic. With films like this one Francis Ford Coppola is a genius. Al Pacino and the late Marlon Brando are two of the best actors in the World and this movie proves it. If I could I would 4 thumbs up.",positive
One of the best movies ever!!,positive
marlon Brando's best and i like that tune of NINO ROTA,positive
"I hadn't seen any of the Godfather movies until just this week, which is odd compared to anyone I know. I'd always wanted to see this movie as it is one of the ""classics"" by many people's standards. This isn't my typical genre, but I can't pass up a ""good movie"" either, so here we are. ;) No surprise, this was an amazing movie. For as long as it was, I was mesmerized by the amount of intricate details coming together as the movie progressed. It seemed like it was weaving together a lace tablecloth...I felt like I needed to hang on every word and action in order to know every bit of the story. Some things were kind of subtle, you couldn't blink for a second! After watching this one, I'd felt like I'd been through a couple of movies - there's just so much packed in there, it actually took energy to watch it! Tonight I've rented the Godfather II and I can't wait to see how things unfold in the sequel. Yay for great film!",positive
That was so worth 3 hours of my life. Very good movie :D,positive
Probably the best example of what a 'perfect film' looks like. There is simply nothing wrong with this film. The best and most deserving Best Picture winner ever.,positive

"amazing, well thought, perfectly acted, masterpiece, this movie is the gold standard of movies, this is the ultimate mafia drama, it has everything of anything in it. If you dont like this movie, don't watch any other movie, because you have no taste. This movie is the best movie ever concived.",positive
I love this movie. I even have a VHS set that shows the first two in chronological order.,positive
"I watched this film for the first time in about 6 or 7 years, I did not write a review because I was only ten when I first saw the first two films and I did not fully understand it, now at 16, I think I do so here's what I think. Perfection is something that the film makes look easy, it's like it was destined for it. The acting from all with the exception of the woman who played Michael's sister is as close as it gets to flawless. Even when Michael starts to gain his power, Al Pacino was not exactly an intimidating looking guy, and he isn't even know. But there was something about the way he presented himself in those scenes that just gave him that look like others feared him. I have never really been that big of a fan of Marlon Brando, but anyone with any knowledge of cinema and acting whatsoever cannot say that his performance is not one of the greatest in cinematic history, I think that it would be impossible to say otherwise. Duvall probably has the most likeable role in the movie as Tom, the guy who follows orders and hardly ever asks questions. Duvall is one of our times finest actors and he shows why like he has showed in many in this film. The score, Nino Rota's music is truly unlike any other score ever released, it might not be this complex.. whatever, there is something about it that makes it almost like a dream. The directing is perfect, the lighting is fantastic, all of the supporting roles are fantastic, it moves smoothly and swiftly, it does not even feel like a three hour movie, mainly it did not to me because I was too busy admiring it. James Caan is also very good. I give the film 4 stars because I like to rate movies like the pro's do it, maybe one day I'll make a great movies section like Ebert, The Godfather will of course go in, I'm glad I watched it again after all these years.",positive

The acting by the whole cast with the likes of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Cazale, Keaton, and Shire was amazing and was one the best of performances by them in their careers.

This film tells the epic story of the Mafia, based around oe of the families, the Corleone's. his really is an epic movie, and probably the ultimate there is in ganster movies.

The story was so complex with so many twists and turns that had me shocked and kept me guessing I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil anything. This movie had masterful direction from a master director. This movie is iconic and has iconic characters that have inspired so many other movies and television shows. No matter how hard anyone tries they will never come close to capturing the mastery of this movie.",positive

"If I may ""criticize"" this MOVIE, I would say it has the flaw of nearly all films based on (good) books: there are too many things to say and too little time to explore the characters in depth. For example, I don't believe that, the change in Pacino's character because of the events, is persuasively depicted. But I suppose, when you 've watched a 3-hour movie and you want more, that's an achievement itself!",positive

"It's funny, if you talk to pretty much anyone around the globe about The Godfather, they know exactly what you're talking about. Whether they've seen it or not, they know exactly what you mean. Some of them will even muster up a quote or two. Such is the worldwide influence of Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The film revolves around the Corleone family, in particular Don Vito Corleone and his sons; Michael, Santino (Sonny) and Fredo and their involvement in a budding mob war. So why is this one piece of cinema so absolutely, world-changingly (yes that's a word... now) good? Let's have a look. <br/> <br/>First of all, the script. Perfectly smearing the line between realistic and stylised, it is THE most quotable gangster movie of all time with lines like ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,"" ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes,"" etc. But it also gives the characters a depth which hundreds of other films have found hard to replicate. Each line is specially crafted for its character and is filled with rich subtext and double meanings. The realism factor means that lines aren't over stylised and polished to within an inch of their life, which helps to create an atmosphere of a slightly elevated reality. <br/> <br/>The acting. It's not often that a filmmaker is granted the use of an ensemble quite as amazing as this, and they are all incredible. Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone has long since passed into cinema immortality as he mumbles his way through the script perfectly. For the most part he is calm, in control. But when moments of anger or sadness come along, he is explosive. His restraint throughout the film is top notch and it makes the more heightened emotional states that much more incredible. The best example of this is in when he's speaking with Johnny Fontane about his part in a film coming up. I'm surprised the screen doesn't shake every time. Al Pacino's Michael is a standout as well, with his cold, calculating personality and fierce protection of his family, as well as a sort of hidden danger inside of him which rears its head occassinally. There are so many layers to his character that you will not get it the first time around. Pacino is at one of the many peaks in his career in this film and its incredible to watch him do what he does. <br/> <br/>The direction is fantastic as well. Coppola manages to keep the audience engaged over the entire epic 3 hours of run time with brilliant lighting and beautiful honeyed tones as well the darker shadowy moments in which nothing is certain. He captures the harshness in both the daytime and the night equally. Just the fact that he took on such an amazing project is kudos enough, that it worked is even better. <br/> <br/>However, as I mentioned, it is 3 hours long, and often there are slow, very slow, moments. But hang in there and you'll be rewarded with having seen one incredible film. <br/> <br/>Francis Ford Coppola's stylised, almost mystical, representation of the American Mafia is a timeless piece of cinema, the likes of which you'll only see every fifty years. Filled with amazing set piece after amazing set piece, if you haven't seen it yet, DO IT NOW! <br/> <br/>Defining Scene: <br/>What, are you kidding? The now immortalised horse's head scene. It'll get you everytime. <br/> <br/>Memorable Quotes: <br/>""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" <br/>""Luca Brasi held a gun to his head and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the contract"" <br/>"" If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you."" <br/>""Fredo, you're my older brother and I love you, but don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever.""",positive
"One of the best movie I've ever seen; forget any other crime/mafia movie. No other movies in it's genera can beat The Godfather. Even for the 3 hours it plays, it never gets slow: ever single minute is used. Gun fights intertwined with family loyalty, inner conflicts, character growth/change, etc; makes the story layered and interesting. It's a movie you might have to view more then once to truly appreciate it.",positive

"The story of a Mafia family itâs about honor and loyalty but itâs also a story of crime, it espouse and perverts the American dream. The film has so many iconic scenes that stand out in memory even when years pass between viewings. The film was based upon the best selling novel by Mario Puzo. The film has an amazing cast who bring to life memorable and well rounded characters to earn our sympathy despite some of the deeds they perpetrate. While Marlon Brando would receive the accolades and the Academy Award we also have Oscar nominated performances from James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino. Also of note are John Cazale (he appeared in only 6 films before his untimely death, all of them were nominated for Best Picture), Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda and Talia Shire. The cast between them have thus far won 5 Oscars wins and been nominated for another 22. We have the incredible score of Nino Rota remains one of the most evocative scores in film, and it is a tribute to the composer and the film that just a few notes can conjure such images almost 40 years later. We also have the wonderful cinematography of Gordon Willis who created such powerful visual images, at times very warm while at other times so very dark. Thereâs no doubt that the film does paint a somewhat romanticized portrait of a mafia family but itâs not just a film about crime itâs about family. The film was followed up shortly by a very good sequel (Godfather II) that maintained the high standards of its predecessor even to the extent of achieving the Academy Award for Best Picture, but for me it wasnât quite as compelling. These films were followed by a less memorable sequel (Godfather III) 16 years later that while earning 7 Oscar nominations itself, mostly served as a reminder of how much less powerful it was than its predecessors. The film appears near the top of the AFI list as well as almost every other lists and stands currently at #2 on IMDB.",positive
"The greatest American story of all time,I have seen this movie more than any other and it never gets old.",positive
A classic! What more can I say?,positive

"Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 epic, about the crime underworld in New York City is an exceptionaly well made film, about power and those who both want and need it. ""The Godfather"" still remains, to this very day, just as riveting as it was when it was first released back in 1972. This classic tale about Vito Corleone, head of the Corleone crime family and his son Michael. Both actors are played by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Set in the heart of New York, when Vito is shot and almost killed, Michael takes over, but only after his older brother Sonny(James Cann) is brutally killed. Story moves on with Michael being married (twice), the whole crime world going into chaos, and a story so plain on the outside, yet so complex on the inside, that remains just as entertaining today. Led by a superb cast of actors with Marlon Brando starring in the role of Vito. He not only plays the wise old Mafia man, he practically plays a king. A king was able to not let the power get to his head, while he competitors attempted to force it into his head. Brando gives the best performance of his career. After watching his performance in ""The Godfather"", you not only believe that Brando deserved that Oscar, which he did win, it was practically his birth right. Starring in the role of his son, Michael, is a very young Al Pacino. Giving the performance which practically made him into the star he is today. Playing the son of a Mob boss is not easy but Pacino makes it seem that way with his riveting performance. He would return twice more in the same role in parts ""II"" & ""III"". The rest of the cast includes Diane Keaton as Michael's wife and mother of his children, John Cazale as one of Michael's brothers, Fedo. The man who would later try to kill Michael is one of the most believable characters ever created, but of course he was played by such a believable guy. Also starring in this film is James Caan as the oldest of the brothers Sonny, the tough headed and ruthless brother who is shot down and massacred by the rival mob. Robert Duvall also turns in a A+ performance as the adopted step-brother Tom Hagen. It's hard to say that one actor is better than the other, simply because there are no actors, there are only characters. These ""actors"" were able to truly becom the characters they were portraying, and that is something to admire. Based off of the novel by write Mario Puzo, as are the next two films, the movie is actually better than the source material. The novel is actually one big crime mystery, not as intriguing as the film. But the somehow the movie just ends up being better. A rariety, especially now when just about everything is based off of some previous material. Whether it be a book or whatnot, they're never able to be quite as good as the original material. This movie is. The Godfather was also able to spawn something that was never, and still isn't, possible to this date... a great sequel. It was actually able to make sequel that was just as creative and indulging as the original, without boring you out or just not being interesting. It's amazing. ""The Godfather"" is and always will be considered as the greatest movie of all time. Its a given, nothing that has ever been released can even measure up to the standards set by this film and its successor. Nothing so far has equaled it, and nothing ever will. This film is a one of a kind, something that can't be duplicated. Ever. Between its amazing story, incredible acting and direction, it's hard to pin point exactly where or why ""The Godfather"" is simplye put as a one of a kind. It's simply an offer you can't ever refuse.",positive
"To me its okay, but still good, but okay and very slow.",positive
classic. gets better every time I see it.,positive
"I only wish it had been two hours longer, so it could have contained more of the book. This one, I just can't recommend enough.",positive
classic cult mafia movie,positive
"I can see why this movie is a classic now. Don't know how interested I am in watching the rest of the trilogy, but it was good to finally watch this one. Amazing cast.",positive
"american classic, nuff said",positive
Yeah...not the greatest movie of all time.,positive
"What can I say, it's the fucking Godfather, its part of America and Cinema, forever; One of thee greatest films ever made. It changed the film-industry forever; it brought good films to the public, and they wanted more; until Michael Bay came along and took a shit on it.",positive
"It's a great film, no doubt about it, but these days whenever someone mentions The Godfather and what a masterpiece it is I want to kill someone. Of course it's good, it's Francis Ford Coppola doing the Mafia and the acting is uniformly excellent, but good lord this is not the end-all-be-all of cinema. Empire magazine and the internet have ruined this film for me and I would like never to hear about it again.",positive
One of the all time greatest films and with out doubt Al pacino's finest role. With so many memorable scenes that will never be forgotten.,positive
"Reviewing a production as profound as The Godfather is a great pleasure and also an exercise in futility. Those who haven't seen the film aren't likely to rush out and grab a copy based solely on my affectionate analysis, and long-time fans shouldn't need additional prodding. As such, I'll leave the rigorous debating to the film historians, and simply focus on the success of the film, as well as my personal opinion on its relevance. Last year, I went on a 26-mile backpacking trip with a group of six friends with a variety of backgrounds. One of the guys in the group was raised without a television, and spent the better part of his 20's catching up on everything he missed in his childhood. As an outdoor lover, I find it hard to criticize anyone who chose to promote physical activity rather than sitting in front of the television, so despite the shock of a television-free childhood, I could understand his parents reasoning. What I couldn't understand, is how he managed to dig into everything under the sun during the past 12 years, and never take the time to watch The Godfather trilogy. He earned his fair share of group chastising while the rest of us praised Coppola's cinematic gems, and eventually promised to watch the films back-to-back during the inevitable recovery period at the conclusion of our trip. Whether or not he followed through is irrelevant, but our group discussion of The Godfather brought two things to light. First, I've never stumbled across another film series with such a loyal following. If you walk down the street and ask ten people if they've seen The Godfather, I'd imagine nine of them will say yes. Second, everyone who views the film will come away with a different analysis of what makes it so profound. Coppola didn't simply make an entertaining film; he made a masterpiece with limitless appeal. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is a well-respected leader among the Italian-American community. Hidden beneath the exterior of a businessman in the olive oil trade, Vito is a charming dictator with his hands in a variety of legitimate and criminal ventures. One day, the Corleone patriarch is approached by the representative of a rival family with a request for assistance in a profitable narcotics venture, which Vito refuses. This sets off a tragic war between the two families, and eventually leads to a leadership transfer from Vito to his son Michael (Al Pacino). Michael is a well-educated young man with conflicting ambitions. On the one hand, he wants to legitimize the family business and escape the violent world of organized crime. However, he soon realizes the rival families are out to ruin the Corleone family, and intend to remove the head of the organization in order to cripple the body. With a constant target on his back, Michael is forced down a crash-course on betrayal and deception, as he furiously battles to protect everything his father built. Nominated for eleven Academy Awards and winner of three (Best Picture, Best Writing, and Best Actor in a Leading Role for Marlon Brando), the 1972 release of The Godfather is an epic portrayal of organized crime, told through the sympathetic eyes of the individuals embroiled within the conflict. Heroes become villains and vice-versa, until the lines between good and evil converge onto a singular path. In many ways, the meteoric rise of the Corleone family could be compared to the rise of the American nation in the years following World War II, making The Godfather the quintessential ""American"" movie during the early 1970's. Naturally, there are a myriad of reasons why the film became such a huge success, but to this viewer it boils down to two key factors. Pure, unapologetic glee at witnessing the power of greed coupled with self-righteousness, and the violent struggle that results when humans attempt to take what isn't theirs. In my personal opinion, there has never been another film (except perhaps The Godfather, Part II) that captures the essence of a lifestyle that seems entirely foreign to 99.9 percent of the population, but also draws an associative link with 90 percent of viewers. I still can't comprehend how Coppola pulled off the balance in such a rewarding fashion, but it remains a true testament to his ability as a director. Despite Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone and his resulting Best Actor award, this will always be Al Pacino's film. Stepping into the shoes of Michael Corleone had to be an ominous undertaking for a 32 year-old actor with only two films under his belt, but Pacino quickly demonstrated his worth as the conflicted successor to the family business. Standing next to accomplished actors such as Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, Pacino likely felt like a fish out of water during the initial days of filming, but when you consider his character is initially portrayed as an outcast from the family business, he seems the perfect fit for Coppola's vision. His slight frame, wide-eyed expressions, and unusual tendency to hunch over make him appear far less capable of filling his father's massive shoes. Yet his vicious cunning and willingness to do whatever it takes draws the respect of his peers, and propels him into an almost god-like status. I often wonder where the Pacino of those days disappeared to, but perhaps we're simply realizing the importance of a talented director in bringing out the best in his actors.",positive

One of the greatest films of all time.,positive
"An epic film about a mafia family. It was definitaley a first of its kind, from the dark frames to the graphic violence. It went far beyond a shoot em up gangster film, to one about characters and family bonds. Brando of course created a forever memorable character. This film made Coppola a success and turned him into a Godfather like figure among many up and coming filmmakers of the time, paving the way for many of them.",positive

"One of the few movies that I can watch over, and over again. Obviously the best mob film ever made, arguably one of the best films ever made period. Most everyone can agree on the greatness of this epic.",positive
The Godfather took family business to another level. There was a presence of classic and originality that kept the movie unique from every Marlon Brando cheek scratch to James Caan still standing after 40 shots to the body. Godfather still does its job to entertain and educate being a 38 year old movie.,positive

The Godfather is an Epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. All of their performances in this movie are great. The Godfather i think isn't just one of the best gangster movies of all time, i think it is one of the best movies of all time. Also i think The Godfather is the best Francis Ford Coppola film.

"Enough has been said about the greatness of The Godfather that I don't really need to try and add anything to the discussion. It's difficult to take the side of Peter Griffin in Family Guy when he's about to drown in his family's panic room and admits he didn't like The Godfather (though it's screamingly funny to hear him defend himself from his family). It's just truly amazing that actors and a careful director can make us care so deeply about brazenly bad people (Scorcese also does this in a lot of his movies). The true mob is nothing to celebrate and we'd all be happy if they were all put in jail or deported back to Europe, but it's a testament to the great filmmaking and phenomenal acting throughout The Godfather (and The Godfather Part II) that we can care about and maybe even root for these characters and their families.

"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten. This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.",positive
"This is a classic film.....that made actors like Pacino, and Brando legends! Fantastic story telling!",positive
"cery average, was expecting a very good if not amazing film, and it turned out to be okay.",negative
"To critisize this film at all is a great way to make people hate you. But a lot of the film's power to shock has been lost in time and the plot doesn't even seem that special. Still, it's a good, even great movie, just a bit over rated.",negative

"Almost the greatest movie of all time A real masterpiece a 3-hour long watch that ""you can't refuse"" One of my favorite movies ever Anyone who didn't watch this is missing out on greatness Marlon Brando is AMAZING, AL Pacino & James Caan are brilliant Robert Duvall is stunning The whole movie and the cast make me wanna yell from greatness :D",positive
"I don't get it, folks.",negative
"An absolute masterpiece, not sure which of the two parts I prefer (don't think you need to make that choice at all). Knowing some of the stuff that went on behind the scenes adds a special something when you watch the movie. An absolute classic.",positive

"The Godfather is one of Hollywood's biggest achievements in cinema history. The movie itself is amazing and almost perfect. It's also an instant classic. Marlon Brando in Don Corleone, the father and Don of the Corleone mob/gang. Right there. Marlon Brando as a mob dealer in the streets of violence and corruption. One aspect of the film that makes it incredible. Next, Al Pacino as his son, who tried to devote the strength he had at the time to the military. But things go wrong, and he's forced to take action, to support and to his keep his family's name respectable. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are both significant actors since they got spotlight. Marlon Brando is the Godfather. People, friends, come to him with problems that they have, and he takes care of them. He keeps his business intact and running in the Mob city. His oldest son, Sonny, is also deep within the family business. Then there's Fredo, then Michael. The plot is long and sometimes difficult to follow along, but that's what makes the movie so much more. Because it's genuinely realistic, and after you watch the movie, you feel like Michael Corleone and you just want a gun and become part of the Mob. It's that simple. The Godfather is THE classic, and no other. This is the film that shaped films to come.",positive
A real classic film. It is intense and put together at its finest. Everyone is on their A-game here. This movie is personal to me and amazing in every sense.,positive

Lessons Learned: Don't hire weak body guards. They get sick or betray you. You get shot or have your wife blown up. Hire the Rock. But not the Rock from Be Cool. Maybe you should hire a ninja instead. I think they are tough.,negative
"An interesting premise, rather let down by shoddy production and hammy acting. One to avoid.",negative
"One for the ages. Possibly and arguably the greatest motion picture in the history of cinema. If there was ever such thing as a perfect film experience, it may just be The Godfather. This timeless, haunting, award-winning classic continues to amaze and stand the test of time.",positive
One of the best...EVER.,positive
Im going to make you an offer you cant refuse... Line of the movie... LOVEd THIS especially the last 1 with Dinero... kinda lmae how he just rolled over and died in the end but stillz a wonderful performance by all the actors.. sighz they dont make em like this any more...,positive

It's better then Taxi Driver, Casablanca, Shcindler's List and even Citizen Kane. Go watch it, it's entertaining and appealing. And every character's role is important. Thats righ, I said everybody's role.",positive

Always make an offer which cannot be refused..!!!,positive
"Indisputably on the short list for greatest motion picture. I've never met anyone who was not impressed by ""The Godfather"" after seeing it. I especially admire the masterful, often ironic, intercutting of scenes, and the engrossing circular narrative that charts the transformation of Michael Corleone.",positive
"what more can you say about this film..... ""THE"" movie of the century! you add perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect acting, perfect art directing, perfect music..... together, you got The Godfather!",positive
"This movie is such a great portrayal of New York mob life that it has become tradition among the Sicilians in my family to force every kid to watch it at least once. This is truly a masterpiece, and to think Brando didn't even have his lines memorized, truly amazing. This is the best mafia movie out there.",positive
Never go against the family,positive

"Certainly the best gangster film ever made, and with one of the best casts of all time. It is an epic American tale, that showcases how one good man can turn to the dark side slowly but surely when pushed. Pacino's performance is magnificent. I can't say I'd always want to watch this, but when I do I get so caught up...it is filled with plenty of classic moments.",positive
Classic filmmaking at its best.,positive

"One of, if not, the best films ever made.",positive
It's simple...MASTERPIECE!!!!!,positive
"There isn't much more that can be said about The Godfather, and it pretty much is a perfect movie. It does fall into typical mobster movies that it throws out a lot of names and is sometimes hard to follow on its first viewing. It is such a strong movie however that multiple views are easy and new things can be seen each time. What is also good about The Godfather series as a whole is watching the rise and fall of Michael Corleone, and the moral corruption of a man. That tied to the issues of family, business, and friendship is why the series as a whole is good (Godfather III not so good). Despite being a great movie, I do personally like The Godfather II better.",positive
"Legendary, absolutely amazing, I wish Francis Ford would make films like this again.",positive
three beautiful hours.,positive
"I know it's a ""great film."" But I've had mob overdose. I don't care about that culture, and the film makes me want to know even less about it than I already do.",negative

"From the opening conversation with the Godfather, to the closing shot, this is a truly beautiful film. An innocent Michael Corleone who strays from the ""family business"" after an attempt at his father's life, takes on the role of crime family Godfather. It all started with vengeance, it ended with a war between families. This is a graphic and haunting tale of the true lives of these crime lords, it wasn't all guns and infamy. There was loss, sorrow and mostly death of loved ones. This reminds us of what we are all capable of in our hearts, it only starts with a little vengeance. This one will stick in your heart for years.",positive
"one of the best movies in cinema history, if not the best",positive

Hell to the Yeah. ;D,positive
Marlon Brando as Don Corleone now that was a masterclass in acting while James Cann and Al Pacino put in great performances as Sonny and Michael Corleone his sons who could do no wrong,positive
"Cannot be faulted. In any way whatsoever. Coppola's genius was not just the script, his vision for the look, feel and music, et al, but his casting and his direction of the actors was quite simply 110% perfect!",positive
"Don Corleone cool,Mikey,Sooney... Mafia Family",positive

Timeless masterpiece,positive
We don't discuss business at the table.,positive
Classic. The American Film Institute got it right in saying it is the second-best American film ever made. It is unbelievably perfect.,positive
"Possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. The storyline is epic beyond imagination! The score is wonderful, the acting is wonderful, hell everything is wonderful. When i saw this growing up it really gives you that sense of family is everything and never to betray the ones you love. If only everyone went by that code of honor. I can't recommend a movie highly enough. If you've never seen the Godfather why are you sitting down reading this? Go and watch it ASAP!",positive
"in my top five movies, it rivals the book, coppolas best movies, it shows the power that a single mancan have",positive
Just one word for this film: A MASTERPIECE,positive
"Being raised Catholic, I was in awe when I first saw the Baptism/assassination scene.",positive
The most realistic crime drama and the greatest Brando/Coppola partnership.,positive
"This was one of the most long and drawn out movie I have ever seen. Now I know people consider this a classic and one of the best movies ever, but I thought it had little action and the story was nothing to love. I was waiting for the movie to get thought provoking or a little intense, but it never happened in the 3 hours. I guess it just isn't my taste.",negative
"Top class movie,just some epic scenes,great quotes,great performances by Brando,Pacino and James Caan.",positive
"I love part I,II & III",positive
The epitome of a classic. This is the mob movie prototype that all other gangster films try to emulate. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are fantastic. Probably the best movie ever made.,positive
Best movie ever bar one,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time. The Godfather doesn't have too many flaws and is just one great watch.,positive
"Quite possibly, The Godfather is cinema's greatest masterpiece. Set just after WWII, the film showcases a Mafia family led by an aging Don leading to a transition of leadership to his youngest son. With classic scene after classic scene and classic line after classic line, The Godfather is movie that is truly timeless. 100 years from now, this move will still have the same impact as it did when first released in 1972. Though Brando rightfully earned a Academy Award for his performance, the breakout star is a young Al Pacino in the movie that made him a god in the eyes of film fans. Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone is amazing as you watch him change from seemingly the black sheep who wants nothing to do with the family business to the power hungry lord of the New York underworld. There isn't much I can say about this film that hasn't already been said.",positive
This is in my top 10 all-time....,positive
"He's gonna make you a offer, you can't refuse.",positive
"One of the gretest movie ever made. Dharmatama, Dayavan, Sarkar, Sarkar Raj etc are inspired by GODFATHER. Many movies copied scene sequences like hiding gun in toilet flush, Changing postion in Hospital, Trap to call on sister news etc. etc. Amitabh asked to alter voice like GF in Agnipath. One of the Favourite Movie.",positive
AMAZING!!!!! It in my top five favorite movies of all time. Suspenseful plot. Great direction. Supurb acting. This movie is close to perfect as a movie can get!! I suggest everybody see it.,positive
Im going to make him an offer he wont refuse,positive
"Make no mistake, a fantasitc piece of cinematic work. Great, epic story arc, complex characters, a fantastic cast, excellent performances (especially from Brando), and an unusually well-polished, cohesive, nicely-paced flow thanks to the editing. However, this is simply not the second best film of all time. Even amongst the movies I have seen (which includes roughly half of AFI's Top 100), this film probably lingers around 30th. I simply feel its cinematography is heavily overrated. Many shots look very flat, even when the camera is neatly positioned. And it does not have the combination of shock value and New Hollywood flair I come to expect from the best of the 1967-1982 era...a flair much more present in Taxi Driver, The Graduate, Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby, Duel, Dog Day Afternoon, The French Connection, and even Raging Bull (another film I feel is generally overrated). Still, this film has far more to its merit than most other films. Its three hours go by surprisingly briskly, and you feel at the end that there is still more to learn about each of the characters.",positive
FOREVER ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE!!!!!,positive
One of the best movies ever made!,positive
I watched this with my Dad a while ago and i totally loved it. I can safely say this is one of the greatest films ever made.,positive
"What movie! A masterpiece of Francis Ford, the best of gangsters, there will never be better that this gangster movie. Although lasts two hours and a few minutes is very entertaining, great acting of Marlon Brando",positive
GREATEST MOVIE EVER. I WATCH ALL 3 OVER AND OVER AGAIN.,positive
Not much to say a classic.,positive
"For me, this wasn't the real Godfather movie. Fair enough, Michael gets initiated, but its the next film that we really see more of an evolution with him. We know he has a soul, we see it in this one, but its the next one where you see it die. Brilliant pre-cursor movie.",positive
when i watched the movie then i was at the scene of the film.it seems that every thing is happening in front of me.THE GOD FATHER is The one creation of this earth.it's the One for all time.,positive
MASTERPIECE! Nuff said!,positive
One of greatest pieces of art America has ever produced!,positive
"A true masterpiece. Even people who haven't seen it know the lines, it has become so ingrained in our lexicon and popular culture movies couldn't exist without it.",positive
"Coppola's impressive understanding of Mafia workings brings a truth to this movie beyond many other movies. It's the quintessential film about Italian Families in the US and the sly working of the notorious Mafia. Pacino and Brando give magnificent, brilliant performances, bringing these mixed up characters to life. There is hardly a moment when I don't feel the struggles they go through as my own struggles. Each shot is so perfectly established and composed that one can be fully immersed in the story. Murch's editing along with Rota's score, brilliantly turns a story into a reality. All around, this film is nothing short of genius, if only Mafia movies were my thing.",positive
Never get sick of this movie. It's still a classic.,positive
One of my Favorite movies EVER!,positive

One of the greatest films ever made,positive
"Very, very good even though Brando's not in it as much as you think",positive
"I prefer the sequel, but nothing compares to the scene outside Don Corleone's hospital where Michael and a Baker brazen it out as a couple of armed hoods.",positive
"This movie is a masterpiece of Italian mob gangs in the US. It really hits you right in the face this movie. If you like drama, action, and suspence this is a great movie to watch. Do take a large bag of chips and a big bottle of something to drink as you'll be busy for a while watching all 3 parts",positive

Absolutely amazing awesome picture and the greatest ending to a movie!,positive
if you havent seen this then u shouldnt watch another movie,positive
"Yes, Francis Coppola's 1972 original is better than the masterful ""The Godfather Part II."" The reason being that everything that is wonderful and heartbreaking about Part II - Michael's moral descent, Young Vito's chasing the American dream - is powerful because of what we have learned about the characters in this story. Honestly, though, that whole debate is pointless because both ""Godfather""s should be considered as one giant 6-hour film. When put together, ""The Godfather Saga,"" as I like to call it, is pretty much the best movie ever made. But when you hear the ominous title, the image that instantly enters everybody's head is Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, whose wise demeanor and inimitable voice towers over the movie and who has become arguably the most famous movie character in history. Brando isn't in Part II and yet the old great man seems a very large part of the 1974 film. It's from of the impression of the first that the second gains its lofty status. Brando's Oscar-winning portrayal may be front and center on the film, but it is actually more Michael's story -- how the fresh-faced soldier is sucked into a life of crime. Al Pacino's breakout performance hasn't aged a bit, and reminds viewers that there was once a time when ""Hoo-hah!"" didn't define Pacino's public persona, but rather his cool, introverted demeanor that could nonetheless express volcanic passion. The scene where he commits his first murder is one of the strongest displays of silent screen acting you'll ever see. Likewise, everything else in the film still feels as fresh and powerful as it was four decades ago. The cast is legendary and the story (and much of the dialogue) is ingrained into the national conscience like some type of scripture. ""The Godfather"" is one of those very select films that mean more culturally than their running time's worth of entertainment. It's more than a movie, it's a signpost that says something about who we are and where we came from. The issue at the heart of the story is the changing of a culrutal landscape and the viewpoints it creates on both sides of the generational divide. Moreover, it investigates what that perennial shift specifically means in America. ""I always believed in America."" Thus, what ""The Godfather"" is not about a mob war at all, but something far more intangible and eternal. It may be a movie made in 1972, and set even further back in history, but ""The Godfather"" (and ""The Godfather Part II"") is just as relevant and worthy of study as any work of art in the 20th Century.",positive
Needs no introduction,positive
"The problem with this film is that I saw it 20 years too late. I've seen countless parodies so the parts of the film which made it unique at the time were wasted. I've grown up around violence in movies so it felt a little tame. However, once I realised this film was more than just an excuse for bad accents and shoot 'em ups I really saw it for what it was. It's amazing... the script is fantastic and it really captivates. It's hard to believe it's nearly three hours long because it doesn't feel like it. I suppose this is one of the 'must see' movies and I am looking forward to reading the book.",positive
"Truly, I believe it is one of the best movies ever made. It's strikingly realistic and well thought-out. It had a potential to be very stereotypical and cheesy, but it obviously side-stepped that, and how. Some of the best actors unite with an incredible director and a brilliant writer to make a movie that is indeed a Classic, and more than deserving of that title.",positive
One of the greastest of all time movies..great cast..,positive

"A bit overrated I think, this maffia movie. Even though I understand that in the seventies people must have been shocked about the pure visual violence in it which was probably never before shown so explicitly. Things have changed. I have seen loads of movies much more violent than this one so to me the shock effect wasn't there. My compliments to the late <i>Marlon Brando</i> who mumbles a lot but it makes his shady character even more obscure. He carried this movie. Let's watch the second part...",negative

Once the greatest movie of all time. Now only bettered by it's sequel.,positive
A classic. Brando refused his Oscar for this engrossing epic depicting life in a 40s era Mafia family.,positive
"Now for the critics and the wider audience, The godfather deserves the number four on the list. As the perfect example on how a movie must me filmed, it is in fact perfect. From the genius narrative of Francis Ford Coppola to its exquisite score, you never questioned when the movie really started, yet alone, when itâs going to finish. Completely takes out the âBased on a novelâ factor and reacts to a life of its own. Great performances, so complacent that at times they overshadow each other, which I truly believe itâs the intention. A mafia movie, a compelling mafia movie that doesnât take any chances when it comes down to spill and splatter blood, but even so, at its most rude and raw nerve, itâs a compelling journey for its characters and has a glimpse of a very insane family movie. Pacino at his best. That is, when he is not trying to develop a performance. For movie fans and not so movie fans, this is the perfect film.",positive

The best gangster movie i've ever seen..marlon brando is my godfather..salute..lol..,positive
"OH. MY. GOD. I heard the rumors, I heard the critics and everyone hyped this movie as being one of the best movies ever to be made - the revolutionary film of its time. And with all the hype and high standards...the Godfather actually pulled through! This film was nuts! Storyline was so intricate and mind-blowing it keeps you going (despite the 3 hour movie length). The shots/camera angles...crazy! The opening shot was like 5 minutes, but still AMAZING to watch, a simple zoom! And the shot with the foot out the car at the end? Killer. Another aspect I really enjoyed with this film was lighting. The shadows of this film really personified the emotions and inner persona of each character, respect to that. Also, character development...as my colleague and I were discussing, movies today don't really have the deep intricate character development that older movies (ESP THIS ONE) has. You are thrown new character after new character but yet you get the hang of it and realize the deeper motives. I love Al Pacino's progressively turned-evil role throughout the film and let's just all agree that Marlon Brando is one bad ass motherf'er (excuse my language). Overall, this film is an American classic and deservingly so. To fully understand American Cinema...you HAVE to watch Coppola's The Godfather.",positive
One of my most favorite movies of all time,positive
Everyone knows the Godfather is amazing,positive
En klassiker som hÃ¥ller Ã¤n... Bella Italia!,positive
I'm so glad you got the Oscar Marlon Brando.,positive
"One of the all time classics and an absolute must see. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino showcase performances that are just out of this world and you know you are watching a gem when 3 hours go by and you want more. Marlon is the Vito ""the Don"" Corleone and head of one of the 5 main mafia families in the New York area and Pacino plays his youngest son who is in position to take over when the time is right. The story chronicles the struggle of leading and maintaining such a powerful enterprise when everyone else is grappling at your power and trying to double cross you. The final 30 minutes are just the perfect culmination to the 1st part of this epic tale and leave you begging for more which Godfather II definitely provides. Perfect plot. Perfect acting. Perfect editing and flow. Perfect movie.",positive
Gangster film of all time,positive
amazing concept and greatly portrayed..,positive
a very great and riveting movie. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are superb.,positive
"Perfect. The first hour of it, I thought was kinda boring. I really got into it after that. I can see why this is one of the best movies of all time. I loved Marlon Brando's character. I thought it was great to see how Michael changed throughout the movie.",positive
very very very good. top 5!,positive

"The Godfather is one of the best films ever, taking 2nd place on IMDb.com, its one breathtakig film, I hate it when the Barzinis ambush Sonny and kill him very badly, I hate that wife beating b***ard, but when Micheal teahces him a lesson, you know you don't f**k with the Coleones",positive

C'est un des meilleurs film de tout les temps. C'est aussi un classique a voir absolluement. Marlon Brando et Al Pacino sont parfaits dans ce film.,positive

Original and still one of the best,positive
Very very good But just a bit slow because it's old,positive

What can I say? It's a classic for a reason.,positive
Probably one of the most perfect pieces of cinema ever made...,positive
"Yeah, it's truly Godfather!",positive
"Not my favorite film of all time, but after seeing it multiple times, I can understand the wide appeal: compelling narrative, engaging music, beautiful images, and a definite staying power--it holds up over time. Most interesting to me is Coppola/Puzo's repeated use of rituals (weddings, funerals, baptism) in the film to underscore the significant role that tradition plays in the family. Those who honor tradition and uphold it grow in power and influence, while those who don't, well . . . die.",positive
"I didn't think I'd like it, but I did.",positive
"you have to see it once,",negative
my favourite gangster movie,positive
my favorite of the three series,positive
"Coppola's masterpiece has epic scope yet also feels very real and personal. Please don't call this a genre film, Godfather 1&2 operate way above the gangster film category. Gorgeous to look at and masterfully acted, this is simply a perfect movie. Obviously one of the ten best American films ever.",positive
"As perfect as film gets. Not a line or movement that feels forced or out of place. Violent, yet virtually no profanity. Sheer excellence on all levels from it's adaptation of Puzzo's novel to Coppola's direction and Rota's imitable score. Great cast and a real rarity, a three hour film that soars by and leaves you ready to dive into it's equally masterful sequel.",positive
don't watch this movie with a family of sicilian-americans,negative
If there can be reference to any movie in history the godfather must be the mecca. The greatest movie of all-time by a mile.,positive
Maybe the best mob movie of all time.,positive

Awesome! Best gangster movie of all time!,positive
las actuaciones y la historia es magnifico.,positive
Yea it's pretty out der,positive
"The father of all mafia flicks; to the ignorant a glorification of crime and violence...truly felt and understood, one must be left troubled at best. Cast is a who's who of the latter 20th century (literally everybody but the kitchen sink...which actually does make an appearance as well).",positive

"anything to do with the mafia,let me have it!",negative
"ive not seen this movie for a while, dont know what to think.",negative
"all you suck. seriously we have been brought up to believe this is a magnificent piece of cinema. Give me 5 good reasons why this movie is so great? The movie drags on with no major ups or downs, completely constant. I'm pretty sure there isnt even a climax in this movie. There are so many characters throughout the film that most of them arent even able to build relationships. I'm a tough critic for you.",negative
"All the Godfather movies are brilliant, although the last one is def the best",positive
Greatest movie ever!,positive
The mafia movie. Godfather I and II are a couple of the greatest films of all time. Must viewing for any movie aficionado.,positive
"I feel like the only person in the world, but I didn't really enjoy watching it. As a whole it was just a little too long and grueling. Little sections were probably some of the best scenes I've ever seen, so I'm by no-means saying its a bad film or poorly made -- Just not for me.",negative
I consider 1 and 2 when ranking these,positive
One of the Best Movies of all time.,positive
"One of the Greatest movies of all time. ""On this Day of my Daughter's Wedding, except this Gift,"" said Don Corleone.",positive
An American masterpiece,positive
"Much better than the 2nd installment. Marlon Brando was one kind of a hottie, wasn't he?",negative
"One of my favourite movies, like ""pulp Fiction"" i'd recomend watching it the 2nd time to really understand and appreciate the film.",positive
The greatest movie of all time for me.,positive
The only movie ever made without flaws. The Godfather is the epitome of cinematography.,positive
YEP! Got to see it in a REAL theater several years back. Lucky me!,positive
"I liked the concept and the theme very much. However, I guess it's just too long which made it hard to endure until the end. I also think that it somehow lacked action, which I expected a lot knowing that it's a gangster film.",positive

"I must admit I was a little scared to write this review because no matter what I write, no words can do this film justice. So, where to start? I believe in this film. Let's be clear, this in not a gangster movie. The Godfather is about family ('a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man'), it's about post-war America, and it's about a war hero, a good man's descent into darkness and solitary. Yet, it's so much more. The screenplay is amazing and the entire film is a huge quotable. An epic poem, a three hour masterpiece. From the iconic opening scene to the scenes in Sicily to the gruesome murders, the audience is always in awe. Coppola put it perfectly when he said that it was the best home movie ever made. You feel like you are a Corleone. No matter what they do you feel they are justified and you agree with what they do. They are never the bad guys. Even Brando as The Godfather is always likeable. This man has killed so many and still you feel for this man. That's great writing. The title of this film is The Godfather yet the movie is about the rise and the loss of innocence of Michael Corleone. Pacino shines and is always chilling. He's always thinking. He has distanced himself from his family yet when his father is targeted he's drawn into the center of the drama. The key scene of his transformation is always chilling. He stands outside of the hospital with Enzo the baker and is attempting to prevent his father from being assassinated. He succeeds and as Enzo attempts to light a cigarette, he cannot because his hand is shaking so much. Michael reaches over and lights it for him, he stares at his hand and sees that it is steady as a rock. The transformation was complete. Following his return from Italy, a conversation takes place between him and his father. We feel right at home. Vito tells his son that there wasn't enough time and that Michael was supposed to be more: A Senator or a Governor, the one pulling the strings. As Michael becomes Don and head of the family, we are almost disappointed for Michael yet we support him one hundred percent. The acting is amazing and it always feels natural. I could literally talk about this film for days. In any time period, any country, this film is relevant. It is life changing and it is amazing. The film starts with the iconic words, ""I believe in America."" Well, this film represents everything America is about and I truly mean it when I say that I believe in this film.",positive
facinating & unforgetable....,positive
a masterpiece very good movie a must see,positive
Classic! A Filmmakers film.,positive
"rly epic...""u come here in ur hour of need.."" loool, awesome performance by Brando",positive
I hate this movie!!!!,negative
Possibly the greatest movie of all time!,positive
"An excellent piece of cinema, from start to finish it's captivating.Certainly a long film, but enjoyable.",positive
"dramatic, inspiring, great performances",positive
Duhhh...nuh nahhhh nuhh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nahh..,positive
"Films just don't get any better than this. It might seem like a clichÃ©, but this is definitely a frontrunner for the greatest film ever made (and yes, it's better than part II, I don't care what anyone says).",positive
Best movie ever made.... EVER!!,positive
"Brilliant. The acting is superb, everything is done beautifully.",positive
the best damn movie ever made,positive
The Classics!!! Take it to the mattresses!,positive

THE BEST !!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"Just Great, A must see.",positive
"not a bad movie must see follows ups of godfather 2,3 and so on",negative
"interesting movie,& I like the theme song of this movie",positive
"Everything about this film has been said over and over again, so I'll keep this short: I've seen it a million times and now I just watch it to see how brilliantly Michael starts turning to a stone cold guy. Don't watch it on itself, but only with the sequel.",positive
its a really good movie of all time,positive
"What can be said about possibly the best American movie ever made? Pacino's best performance ever, but the power of Brando almost makes him pale in comparison.",positive
i'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse. watch this movie!,positive
"Do I really need to explain it? *Sigh* O.K. This is an epic story that shows the true side of the Italian mafia. All the members are just part of one big family. But, as Michael Corleone is trying to figure out, how far must one go for a family who makes its living via heinous crimes like murder and putting the heads of people's prized horses in their beds just because they rejected you on a movie deal?",positive
Not much to say here either.,positive
The best mafia movie ever made...well maybe besides the Godfather II,positive
the most popular mafia group i've know,positive
"Completely lives up to the hype. And I think it's better than the second one, too.",positive
Superb film made especially brilliant by the acting. Great performances all round. Seems to get past the cheesy fare of its era and turn a new leaf for films. Good stuff.,positive
"What can I say that hasn't already been said? A classic. A masterpiece. Pure perfection-- the cast, the acting, the story with lines so quotably memorable, they've been assimilated into everyday life: ""sleep wih the fishes"", ""we go to the matresses"", ""this is business, not personal"" and of course ""I'm gonna make him an offer, he can't refuse"", etc. Also, The Godfather is not as gritty as most crime dramas, whose core appeal revolves around the blood and guts; this film was aesthetically pleasing, so beautiful that even the lighting and the setting was absolutely gorgeous. A must see for any cinephile and if you ever intend to watch only a handful of films in your lifetime, The Godfather should definitely be one of them.",positive
"La mejor pelicula de la historia del cine... no lo sé, pero es una buena candidata.",positive
"What can I say, it's the Godfather, and it is his character, portrayed so well by Brando that makes this a great film. Brando is so natural and gives such life to Vito Corleone just as the actors around him do with their characters, Pacino especially too. This is just a sharp film. Not too violent, not too profane, yet deeply involving in vice and illegal activities.",positive
Pretty slow but thats the way I like it.,positive
Inolvidable. De las que no se dejan de admirar.,positive
"They don't make this type of movie anymore, everytime I catch it on A&E or AMC channel, I find myself watching it for the 9th time",positive
can't get much more classic than this one!,positive
"yup, a bit more exiting than watching paint dry...and i still have 2 to go...lmao...:Os",negative

"The Francis Ford Coppola mafia crime drama is recognized as one of the best films of all time, and it deserves the honor it recieved. Beautifully adapted from Mario Puzo's award winning novel, Coppola directs the film in an extemely original manner and draws as a source of inspiration to today's popular culture and affects the crime genre greatly. The story circles around Vito Corleone, established Italian American mafia boss, who has three sons: Michael, an ex-marine who is next in line for the legacy although his father does not want him to a part of it; hotheaded Satino (Sonny) who is the rude, and impatient elder brother, who cannot wait for the succession; and Fredo, the cowardly younger brother, who eventually betrays his own family. The characters are portrayed by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and John Cazale, respectively. Also starring, are Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton in the other main roels, as the family lawyer and Michael's wife. The film's character devolopment succeeds because instead of acting as a bunch of hired muscles obeying a superior, every character, which are many, have their own great moments, and the relationship between Vito and all his assossiates, from rivals, to godsons, to friends, to fellow partners, are priceless. Also, a massive contribution to the success of the film is the music that provides the film with the sympathy for the characters from the audiences and resolves with sadness and style. The reason why the 3 hour long feature is so respected and loved is because of its lasting appeal. The Godfather has claimed the awards of the year and certainly became the ""Don"" of the 1970's.",positive
"Unbelievably over-rated, pointless, tedious crap.",negative
"This film is three hours long and I have viewed it many times. Yeah, it's a good one.",positive
THE BEST OF THE BEST NEVER REPETED AND NEVER WILL BE,positive
Greatest movie ever... .,positive
"Leave the gun, take the canoli",positive
its a good movie of all time,positive
The best movie around,positive
"An incredibly famous film, often clawing for the title of 'best film of all time'. I personally think that this is a title a little too high for this type of film. I think 'best film' has to be something that can appeal to all and covers all genres (like Back To The Future). This is just a crime film. And it is a novel adaptation (very obviously from its rambling nature) so it is never going to be sharp enough. But I tried to go into it with a clear mind, not expecting the best film ever, because it could never live up to that. I wasn't sure what it was about/supposed to be focusing on until the end. It is about how Michael (Al Pacino), the youngest son of the Godfather (Marlon Brando in that famous role, which doesn't work for me at all - what a stupid voice (who knows what he is saying), and how very ugly he is), is corrupted and becomes the new Godfather. But this is not apparent for a long time. Instead it is just about how the Corleone family do their business of organised crime, and how apparently ridiculously easy it is for some powerless drug pusher to completely screw them up. Why does Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) need them if he is so powerful and well protected already that he can bring down the Godfather? So, it is not a very focused story, and towards the end, the timeline skips and jumps ahead at an alarmingly confusing rate. There is not much to the characters other than their name, rank and one word personality. Which is why I feel Tom (Robert Duvall) is the best character because he is the only one who seems to have any depth and is also sympathetic. Michael is okay, although Pacino doesn't have very subtle expressions (check out his 'hate face' in the Sollozzo murder scene) and his change from 'that's my family, not me' to 'I will kill everyone' is not subtle, believable or set up. It is a complete U turn, and Michael simply grows a new personality in a matter of seconds. And then it ends on some very tacky juxtaposition. So, it isn't focused enough, but it is all right.",negative
"The scene with Pacino and ""Appolometer"" was hott! =D",negative
another clascic that I believe you must watch,positive
This sets the standard for film making excellence!,positive
Only the best movie of all time!!!!!,positive
"Thank God my Godfather isn't Akive, he means business.",negative
Finally got around to this classic and it lived up to the hype. Looking forward to the next one.,positive
"oh yeah son. if you don't like it, the godfather will kill you! good stuff",positive
this is a fantastic film,positive
"This movie was epic, just like the film's description suggests. What I liked about this film is that it wasn't difficult to follow the storyline, unlike what I thought was going to be the case. It is a classic!",positive
"too many people say they hate this film, yet have never seen it. fuck them. It's one of the best ever.",positive
Classic. Everyone should see this. I have watched this probably 100+ times.,positive

a big one 2 mario puzo,positive
5 stars= perfect movie!,positive
"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.. With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day.. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. This is definetely a ""must see"" masterpiece.",positive
"Klassiker, jeg så denne i fjor tror jeg. La merke til hvor mange andre gangster filmer som drar inspirasjon herfra, og skjønner hvorfor den har fått så god kritikk den har fått.",positive
"great actors, great story. great movie!",positive
"What can you say? This movie is fantastic, ""star studded"" doesnt begin to describe the cast and the story is fantastic.",positive

MY ABSOLUTE FAV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
One of the best movies... Ever...,positive
great beginning but #2's the best,positive
"One of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time. Period. The dynamic acting, music, and writing by Coppola and author Mario Puzo is everything a movie should be. It's all here in an epic saga of a family in the mob--and to think the second one's even better.",positive
"Classic. If you ever hope to understand any spoof movie, this is necessary. If you want to know what almost every other mafia movie means, this is it. It seems it will never be left behind.",positive
Not enough stars to rate,positive

"This movie is the most over-rated movie of all time. Notice that I gave it 3 stars, a good rating, meaning that I did like it. However, it is absolutely not deserving of its claim to best movie of all time. It is merely good, not great, and definitely not epic.",negative
One of the greatest adaptations from literature to cinema. Marlon Brando portraying Don Corleone proves once again he is larger than life,positive

As close to perfect as a film can get. The best film ever. Period.,positive
there is no one like Brando,positive
"I love this movie along with the 2 other one's BUT this one stays my favorite. They are really good movies with a GREAT story. They're very long though, over three hours each movie. So if you're a kind of person that has no patience for long movies, these 10 hour movies (all together) isn't for you. Also, this is a REALLY complicated movie i find, if you get lost you better back it up or you'll find yourself lost for the rest of the movie or till the end, when they finally explain everything. But yeah, i would have to say that these are my favorite triolagy movie. Italian's rule!! lmao",positive
it's the best ever with no challenge..........,positive

How can NOT have seen this!!!!!,positive
"Movie sucks, comparing to the book :)",negative
my favrioute movie everrrrr :D,positive
"Many people see the Godfather and fall in love with the Mafia lifestyle that is presented in it. The main reason why mob movies are not a sub-genre that I usually don't enjoy is that I can't sympathize with any of the main characters. The Diane Keaton character is the one character in the movie that I can feel something for. She is disgusted at the Mafia family lifestyle but is relieved when Michael reassures her that that is not the way he is. Tragically, he is that way deep down, and it takes an attempt on his father Don Corleone's life to trigger his descent into the criminal underworld. During the restaurant assassination scene you could see him becoming desensitized to the violence that comes with the territory. I could easily see that what is undeniably great about the Godfather, is the acting performances, the directing, and the music. The greatness of those elements surpass and make up for most of the flaws which, in my mind include the slow pacing, the Italy portion (which drags and takes away momentum), and the lack of comment on the mob world from the world outside of it. But as I said before, the mob genre is not my favorite. I still think that, among mob films I prefer Miller's Crossing, with its 1920s time period and style of speaking. I can say that that movie and The Godfather are similar in one way-both are hard to follow during the first viewing because of all of the names that are thrown around in the dialogue. It will probably take a few viewings of The Godfather to match up all the names to the faces.",positive
Film Excellence. Brilliant Performances all around.,positive
I just watched this 3 days ago after realizing i've never seen it. Great movie.,positive

"The story begins as ""Don"" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia ""family"", oversees his daughter's wedding. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and ""family"".",positive

"Unlike less experienced filmmakers, Coppola doesn't focus on Mafia violence per se, but rather on the individuals of the familia Corleone - the violence just happens to be a part of their world. We get to know each and every one of the very different personalities that make up the Corelones and their extended networks. Brando's Don is a cool, collected cat who lives by a code of honor and his word; attributes to be admired. Yet this honor is a paradox as he makes it clear that when coming into negotiations with him, refusal is not an option. Caan and Pacino are respectively chilling and reputable as Sonny and Michael, each representing one extreme of their father's ego. Nino Rota's nostalgic score helps to cement a sense of history and ancestry with its timeless quality, and Gordon Willis' rich and shadowy cinematography creates mystery and an unshakable feeling of continuous danger - who's gonna be next to sleep with the fishes? Our hopes for good are shattered when Michael is sucked into his father's corrupt world and crosses a line that cannot be uncrossed, albeit with the good intention of protecting his family. By ordering multiple murders while standing under God during his son's christening, golden boy Michael becomes the biggest hypocrite of all. Despite it's almost three hour running time, this saga whizzes by.",positive
WHAT CAN I SAY ...... COME ON NOW ITS THE GODFATHER...........,positive
"Meh. Seriously, I don't see what all the fuss is about this one.",negative
"One of the greatest movies of all time, a epic tale about a maffiafamily. The Godfather and Godfellas are the best maffiamovies of all times. The actors Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton and of course Marlon Brando are so fucking great.",positive
"""I believe in America"" -- and America embraced The Godfather, turning it into a landmark artistic triumph and blockbuster hit. The movie was initially planned as a low-budget adaptation of Mario Puzo's Mafia family best-seller, and young director Francis Ford Coppola was hired because Paramount thought he would be easy to control. Instead, he fought the studio to cast little-known Al Pacino as Michael Corleone and foundering Marlon Brando as Don Vito, and he turned The Godfather into an operatic period epic about family, honor, and American economic success (the word ""Mafia"" is never used); in return, he was almost fired during production. The finished film's narrative drive and imagery were astonishing. Beginning with the opening sequence intercutting Vito's sepulchral study with the bright wedding outside, Coppola renders the Corleones threatening in their business and appealing in their closeness as they negotiate the legacy of Vito's prosperity. Gordon Willis' shadowy cinematography infused the film with shades of black, brown, and gold, contrasting bleak Family dealings with warm family loyalty. The famously extreme violence, particularly the horse head and Sonny's tollbooth demise (echoing 1967's Bonnie and Clyde), revealed the cost of protecting the family honor; the baptism montage elevated Michael's corruption to diabolical proportions as he consolidates his business power. Highly anticipated and critically revered, The Godfather became one of the biggest box-office hits of all time, adding several catchphrases to the cultural lexicon, revitalizing the gangster genre, turning Pacino into a star, and reviving Brando's career. Nominated for 10 Oscars, The Godfather won Best Picture, but Brando snubbed his Best Actor prize and Coppola lost Best Director to Cabaret's Bob Fosse. Willis' cinematography wasn't even nominated, and although Nino Rota's memorable music did initially receive a nomination, the Academy rescinded it when they discovered that Rota included material in the score from one of his earlier compositions. In 1998, the American Film Institute named The Godfather one of the three greatest American films ever made, testifying to its enduring artistic legacy.",positive
One of the best underworld movies!,positive
"I love it! Indeed, classic! a good story and acting... Al Pacino is awesome... Looking forward watching II and III... How I missed them until now!",positive

mafia my friend mafia,positive
"One of the greatest films of all time. Epic in nature, the Godfather takes you on a ride with a mob family that has Michael Corleone wrapped up in something he may not be prepared for.",positive

"The Godfather is pretty much a perfect film in every sense of the imagination. Visually stunning, incredibly well written and acted and directed by the best yound director in the business (at the time), it stands as a remarkable achievement and, quite possibly, the greatest film ever made. From the opening scene to the closing one we are treated to something that had never been seen before up to this point in cinema. The blueprint for every gangster movie that has come since, The Godfather will forever be etched into the memories of those who have seen it. A truly powerful and unforgettable film, no recommendation could be higher.",positive

"Ã n'en pas douter, le meilleur film que j'ai vu...",positive
"Al Pacino and Marlon Brando lead an excellent cast in this compelling gangster film. But it is waay too long-- the scenes of Michael's exile are unneccesarily protracted, and could have been cut/trimmed-down without losing much.",positive

Greatest movie ever made,positive
"Evidemment Marlon Brando est fantastique. Tellement que ca en devient genant : tous les autres personnages et acteurs apparaissent fades en comparaison (sauf peut-etre Luca Brasi / Lenny Montana). Evidemment il y a pas mal de scenes geniales, copiees et parodiees cent mille fois depuis, le cheval, la voiture au peage, la porte qui se ferme, etc. Mais la encore ca a ses limites : le passage sicilien, sorte de parenthse a l'eau de rose digne des Feux de l'amour, a eu avec moi beaucoup de mal a passer... En plus tout ca pour une fille qui tire la gueule tout le temps et qui se laisse seduire avec un collier en or, et dont le script se debarrasse d'une facon assez expeditive... Ce qui nous amene a la musique : oui il y a deux themes geniaux (mais apparemment repris d'un film plus ancien, et toc pas d'Oscar pour Nino Rota), mais l'utilisation du thÃ¨me romantique m'a du coup un peu decu (une musique aussi geniale pour montrer Al Pacino et sa copine-qui-sourit-jamais marchant sur un chemin en Sicile ??? Vraiment ???!) Bon comme ca j'ai un peu l'air d'avoir deteste, on est bien d'accord que non, hein, c'est un film de mafieux / gangsters comme je les aime, avec des voitures noires un casino des gens en costard et plein de scenes ou l'on mange et boit du vin (vous me ferez penser a faire une comparaison avec Munich de Spielberg, comparaison pas si stupide a mon avis). Curieux de voir comment sera le 2e volet...",positive
Just saw this for the first time. Eh. Didn't do it for me...,negative
"Vito Corleone, ""The Don"", is one of my favorite movie characters, 'cause he's serious, calm, intelligent and lethal. The movie is excellen because of the action, the plot, the original ideas and for Brando's performance (although Pacino is really good too). One more thing, I think this is the movie that has the best script based on a book, even better than A clockwork orange.",positive
I finally saw this! I can see why it's a classic!!,positive
One of the best movie i've ever seen!,positive
"In my opinion, the greatest movie that has ever been made.",positive
La mejor de todas!!!,positive
"Simply one of the most epic movie ever, with a breathtaing performance from Don Corleone Marlon Brando, and a young Al Pacino about to be one of the best actors of his generation.",positive
"what can i say about this one, it was one of the greatest movies ever made, an instant classic!!!",positive
"THE MOVIE WAS LONG, BUT THE STORY AND THE ACTORS IN WERE ALL GREAT!",positive
"What can you say about âThe Godfatherâ that has not already been said? Iâve got nuthinâ. Godfather I and II should be viewed as one continuous story. It is simply an amazing story, an American treasure, and; I might add, a great history lesson as a backdrop for the Corleone familyâs exploits.",positive
"The only thing keeping this score from perfect is the lack of an actual good story, but the fact that this barely affects the score tells you how fucking good this movie is.",positive
The greatest of all times!,positive
Al pacino plays a gripping gang leader. A classic film that shouldn't be missed by any film fan. Not a short film and certain moments do drag on a bit.,negative
Glorious Wonderful Movie!!! Stick your eyes and feel the pressure... Nothing Better than This Movie!!,positive
"The godfather changed film forever, with expert directing and flawless script writing you will be sucked into the deep and complex story. Coppola relentlessly intimdates the most successful of film makers with this artistic and brilliant masterpiece. Verdict The best film ever made.",positive

Very good movie full of action and drama recommened it to any one who likes action.,positive
"This movie is incredible. It gets better with every viewing. This movie is never out of the top 5 movies of all time. My favourite scene is where michael goes to visit his father in hospital then realizes that the other families have sent people to kill him. So without a gun michael adapts to the situation and manages to save his father. brilliantly breathtaking and thats just one scene out of many other great scenes in the movie. And if you disagree i,ll make you an offer you cant refuse.",positive
I love mob movies... books... plays.... So this is great!,positive
Masterpiece. To make such a large crowd of people be so drawn to a movie is amazing in it self. Most movies that are based on true events usually are better than those that aren't. This one did it.,positive

"must see movie of all time,...",positive
Godfather is always godfather.,positive
Only The best triology of all time!,positive
This is Marlon Brando (okay Al Pacino is the protagonist) and a very heavy hitting cast. You can't step to this. You can hear that sad instrumental theme that has since become a classic just flowing on the wind.,positive

"Seen the first and the second ones, but not the third. Yet.",positive
"This movie is about more than just the Italian Mafia and gangsters. Its about family, loyalty, and strange Italian pastries. From the first moment, when Don Corleone is taking ""requests"" during his daughters wedding, to Sonny being gunned down at a toll booth on the Jersey Turn-pike, to Michael taking over for his dead father, there is no down time, no point that caused me to loose interest. Fantastic camera work, a haunting score, and inspired acting from the entire cast, and a cast with more big names than this years oscars. This is the movie all others are judged against. One of the Best Movies Ever.",positive

Nobody ever makes me an offer I can't refuse.,positive
I never get sick of seeing it.,positive
Still relevant. Still great. Probably one of the best movies ever made.,positive
Certainly the greatest of its kind; arguably the greatest of all time,positive
"A fantastically crafted film and although it took me 20odd years to build up the patience to watch it, I truly enjoyed it. It was subtle and understated without being pretentious or confusing. Everything was perfectly balanced from the pace, to the dialogue to the characters. So often nowadays films are crass or over the top, especially in this genre. I cannot quite construct into words how well made this film is. Despite all of my film school background I cannot even bring myself to deconstruct it. I recognise its skill and craftmanship but feel there is no point of ruining the illusion. I don't need to know how the magic trick was done, I am a spectator I just need to know it was spectacular - which it was.",positive
The ultimate mafia movie...,positive
I find this film one of the best gangster war films around!,positive

"Marlon Brando made himself out of ranking he is no more to be questioned , he is as great as Plato in philosophy now . the music is unbelievable , and all other things are so Itlian in ART , So american in Spirit. its one of the greatest Art pieces ever made by humans , its the monalisa of cinema.",positive
only managed to watch 20 minutes of it before i gave up,negative
Amazingly done. Very rich in psychology and captures Pacino and Brando at their finest. The violence is muted from what I expected but the tension - between the families and within Michael Corleone himself - unwrapped themselves nicely.,positive

"I'm somewhat embarassed to say that I'd never sat down and watched this entire movie straight through until last week, but I have to say that there isn't anything quite like seeing this (or any movie, really) on the big screen. (Thank you Criterion Cinemas in New Haven!) I don't have to go into detail about why this is a brilliant movie; acting, music, story, cinematography, lighting, editing; everything is fantastic. In short, while on the surface its a pretty film to look at, its more importantly an American crime epic with a dark, vengeful heart, made great by a superior cast and crew. Must-see.",positive
"I hate VCD's.i watched it in VCD.and they have sounded it so bad that i cant enjoy all.but besides it was very very great.i cant imagine it on DVD.anyway let's speak about the movie.it made me feel like i was watching Shawnhawk Redemption.beginings were dissapointeing but when i watched all.i gave it 4.5 stars.so im gonna be good this to this one too.anyway acting was great but actually i loved the senario.it tells ""family comes first"" and how some businesses are tough.i mean these guys have the most risky job on the world.of course they will have tragedies.and camera isnt that good but angles are great.so watch it.its impossible not to like.",positive

"I honestly did not find this film nearly as good as the reverence that surounds it. It's an incredably well crafted film, with some great cinomatography and some absolutly fabulous performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, who is absolutly incredible. I just find that that magic ingrediant that makes me love a film is missing. I can appreciate the craft of this film, but with the exception of the batism sequence, which is beyond perfect, I just find the film well made and well put together, not an undisputable masterpiece.",positive
omg i watched this wid my dad and like the first few minutes of it they've already killed someone! not my kind of film but it weren't bad,negative

"I used to love it, now i watched with lees passion",positive
"A great movie. I think like the acting of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, the scene where Michael Corleone is participating in the baptization of his sisters kid will go in the annals of history of cinema as one of the most powerful scenes. The gentle change with no sharp edges of Michael Corleone, the haunting presence of Vito Corleone and the rivalry between them for supremacy is awe inspiring. The only movie till date when the movie compared well with the book, Mario Puzo was involved in screenplay no doubt ! The music of the movie sends chill down the spine, not because it is frightening but because it is so well suited to the movie. It looks like another actor with a very important presence. Acting 5.5* Music 6* Cinematography 6* Editing 6* Direction 6* Story 6* (It is out of 5* !)",positive
"They all say its great, and it is. You need to pay attention, though",positive
Very interesting characterisation and exploration into the 1940's mafia with a young Al Pacino as the sensible Michael Corleone who does not want to be part of his father's empire. I think the 2nd film is where we start to see Al Pacino really flourish.,positive
One of the best. Ever!,positive
I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless. But not men,positive
"One of the best offerings of the New Hollywood era, offering fresh ideas, stylistic filmmaking and excellent acting. Re-vitilised the gangster genre which hadn't been around since the Classical Noir gangsters of the 1930's and 1940's, also further enhanced it through the change of Censorship and ratings system of 1967 and 1968.",positive

"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is an American classic and one of the greatest films ever made in cinematic history. It's a masterful and powerful inside look on the criminal underworld along with the characters and things that go along with it. Boasted by legendary performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, an excellent script, outstanding direction, and a smooth, soothing soundtrack. The true exception of the The Godfather, however, is that it has one of the most sophisticated and glamorous characters of all time. This is probably the best American film ever made, not to mention the best gangster story ever told.",positive
Too long and the sequel is only a little better. I don't know if I will be seeing the second sequel in my lifetime. Not a good franchise to me.,negative
all of them are fantastic movies!,positive

Only one thing to say: It's a true classic,positive

"I finally watched it after all these years. Maybe I am just spoiled by the great gangster/mafia movies that have come as descendents of this classic. I found it, the Godfather of gangster movies itself, to be just blah. Once I overheard a loudmouth in the theater say to his friend that Lord of the Rings took all its ideas from Star Wars. Maybe I should have told him it was the other way 'round, that Lucas read Tolkien. Anyway, at the risk of sounding like that guy, I think American Gangster knocked off The Godfather.",negative

"A Masterpiece of its time. I've been eharing that the Godfather is such a great movie that I bought all three over the weekend and watched them. I have to say the first Godfather is the best godfather. Marlon Brando brings a great performance although with and iritating voice here and there but it fits his character. Al Pacino very different from his vicoius role as Tony Montana he plays a calm and thinking gangster as Michael is a very interesting and growing character. The sub plots are nice, the acting is supreb, every minute of it is a watchful moment of what will happen and what will come. The movie gives its two tales of Michael and Vito as we learn to care for these chacareters as they struggle to keep their organization in calmed hands. Unlike other gangster films this movie brings the harsh tone of violence down but near the end we are presented with enough carnage of revenge and blood that we are entertained without them or with. All in all this is the best Godfather, Godfather Part II I thought was OK and Three was eh. This is my favorite Godfather film of all time. Its a very good movie!",positive
OH MY GOD. This movie is just so great and well put together. I mean I don't have to review this movie because you have to see it. Hands down the best movie ever made.,positive

Who can resist the Corleone Charme?,positive

Justifiably considered the greatest movie ever made. Probably the greatest cast ever assembled with Brando and Pacino giving all-time performances. A movie everyone must see in their lifetime.,positive
The best movie ever made.,positive
THE MOST Classic mobster movie ever. One of my personal favorites of all time,positive
"- on blu ray - I had never seen this film until about a week ago but I always knew it was one of those movies I should have seen years ago. So I've seen it twice now and it is in my opinion a tad overrated. But all in all still a good movie, I believe it is far better than it's sequel. The movie is so well cast too.",positive
"un monument du cinéma mafieux , du cinéma tout court ...",positive
I always say the truth even when I lie ! Tony Monntana,negative
"Stellar cast! This is a great story that keeps you glued to your seat the entire movie. This is the King of all Mafia movies. Even If you don't like Mafia/Mob movies you will like this! Yes, it is a somewhat long movie but it is worth every minute and feels like time just flies by.",positive
What can I say? Classic!,positive
Best Italian mob epic tale....ever!,positive
"""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.""",positive

.............two words AL PACINO!!!!!!!!!! Amazing movie,positive
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,positive
"There is literally nothing i could say to define how good this movie is (not because i'm stupid) because It's so good... I have no idea what to say. I could say it's better than god, but that wouldn't be enough. plus i'd probably get shot by certain thick people. I could say it's a million times better than any other movie but that wouldn't justify how good it is either. If you've watched it, you already know it's unbelievably fantastic (unless you're a tit) and if you haven't watched it, you have no excuse. It's been out twenty-seven years. you've had plenty of time to watch it. Don't worry, just go buy/rent/steal/imagine a copy of The Godfather and watch it now. Now.",positive
"I'm not even gonna bother with the spoiler alert, but Sonny's death scene always gives me the same feeling i get everytime i watch Mr Blonde or Billy Costigan get shot. I got so PISSED OFF when i first saw all of these scenes. Just when they're shown being the harshest badasses, they get wasted, and in this case have like 50 squibs go off.",positive
The second best movie of all time....only one better is Godfather part 2... 'nuff said,positive
I felt in love with micheal after i saw the movie. I wish i was Kay. Damn!,positive
"Few movies have the incredible ensemble cast that the Godfather showcases, However its Al Pacino and Marlon Brando that truly make this movie so incredibly powerful and moving...The transition that Pacino goes through from unblemished army boy to cold hearted Don as wel as the complete character of Micheal Corleone so impeccably crafted that youll need to watch the movie over and over again just to take in all the intricate mannerisms and minute detail that was put into the role....other then that James Caan is unforgettable as the hot tempered Sonny and Robert Duvall is perfect as Tom Hagen....",positive
"My favorite, in this story Mario Puzo combines the flashback with the revenge and italian sense of loyalty",positive
It was brilliant then and is still now.,positive
Perfect. THE best gangster movie trilogy.,positive
respect for the Godfather.,positive
MASTERPIECE!!!!! SPLENDID,positive
"It's long, strange, but good",positive
What more is there to say about The Godfather? A classic tale of the Corleone family from the 1940's to 1950's that defined gangster films.,positive
One of my fav's of all time,positive
And my great grandfather has this poster with a picture of himself glued overtop of the head.,positive
"Ubestridt et mesterværk. Ham Sonny blev godt nok skudt, hva'?",positive
I really enjoy the godfather 1 and 2. But number 3 was a bit of a let down for me and yet it has it's good parts to it. Personally I watch the first two and then I wouldonly watch the third one to finish off the saga. First one excellent with Brando's performance. Second one outstanding because of the scenery and Deniro gave the performance 100% of the time.,positive

This is SUCH a classic movie. When it comes on TV it takes a lot to resist watching it again. Such a great movie. Some say the Godfather II is even better. I disagree. Although the Godfather II is also one of my favorites.,positive

This is probably the best movie I have ever seen.,positive
Like Toy Story 2 - perfect.,positive
All the answers to Life are in this movie,positive
OVERRATED. If you are a fan. I am sorry. This is not as good as people claim. The second one must be better but I don't have the patience to sit through a film similar to this one. It's almost as boring as golf.,negative
It's the Godfather!! Plain and simple!!!,positive
I can probably quote this movie verbatim. Fantastic.,positive
those who won't watch it because it' violent or a gangster film have absolutely no idea what they're missing and never will because of their stubborn stereotyping,positive
"The Godfather, those words define a lot of what American movies are. The deep complexities of a family crime syndicate are on showcase as well as some stunning performances on the parts of Al Pachino, Marlon Brando, and just about everyone else in the film. The direction is superb, the overall experience is one most should have. Its worth watching numerous times simply to try and take everything in.",positive

WHAT A FREAKING MOVIE. LOVED IT!,positive
un peu long quand mÃªme... un film d'ambiance surtout,negative
"Without doubt the ultimate gangster film with a cast that is of the highest of excellence, and a film that is only upstaged by the strength of its sequel - Brando provides a breathtaking portrayal of Don Vito Corleone, and the development of Pacino's Michael throughout the film is one of splendid tragedy and is a classic that will never be far from anyone's heart",positive

The awesome dialogue and clever mobsters make up for the very long runtime and suspect acting. Still definitely worth watching today almost 40 years after it was filmed.,positive

"This movie is very hard to review seeing as how there is just so many good things to say about it. The acting, the storyline, the camera angles, the character development, everything is just spot on. One thing i suggest though is if you plan to see this film, then rent it and watch it in a dark and quiet room, you can not be disrupted by commercials or chatter when watching this masterpiece. Enjoy.",positive
Do i really need to say anything? You already know what it is kids. Im gonna give you an offer you cant refuse-watch this or die.,positive

Marlon Brando was the only Godfather....,positive
"Its difficult to review this one, so many things have been said about it, so many cliches. A power struggle and the story of the unassuming son becoming a powerful leader. Great cast, great set and so so stylish, for gangsters they have real class, and are men of their word, who do anything to protect their family.",positive
Took me ages to hire this out an actually watch it. A movie everyone should see before they die,negative
I loved the way the family in this film went about things. It was so ugly but so unique. I loved it.,positive

Bloody violent classic about organized crime.,positive
"One of the most classic films of all time. Following the rough transition from Vito to Michael, one of the best movies of all time. The cast, the story, the acting, the music everything adds to this classic making it a timeless ""must see"" movie. Definitely way ahead of its time, and watching it on blu-ray makes it seem like you could have been there watching it happen. Al Pacino does an outstanding job in one of his earliest roles, doesn't let the talented cast around him bring him down at all. He rises to show that he has what it takes to act with legends like Brando and Duvall.",positive

ok so now i know i don't like gangsta films. there was good acting but i just couldn't keep up. i guess i have pretty low concentration skills. this was the first film i had seen marlon brando in and he suited the role really well.,negative
Slow movie with a good story.,negative
"Even with a few dated camera shots and effects, the absolutely flawless cast and its performance is worth every second of watching this movie. I came to this movie late in life, and definitely late in the movies life...but the film still holds up in today's age. I especially liked the Michael character early in the film when he was a respected ""civilian"" as they call it (meaning he was not involved in the mafia). I was a bit sad to see him join in with the family's operations because frankly the war hero son with that much pull even though he's not an active member of ""the family"" was THE Most interesting part I've ever seen written in a mafia movie. If I had one complaint its that I'd like to have seen more of THAT side of the character. As it stands the writing, acting, and even the costumes in this movie are what make it a classic AND a masterpiece. It definitely deserves its spot in the top 100.",positive
"Realized I'd never actually watched it sober before. Was STILL struggling to keep track of all the minor characters, especially the other families and who worked for who--Solozzo, Tatglia, and Barzini are still murky. But now I know which one Clemenza and Tessio are, and who Luca Brasi was (I had always thought he was a Corleone enemy). Michael's walk over to the dark side wasn't fleshed out enough for me. He's too self-important and arrogant to begin with, its not a big stretch for him to get his hands dirty to get what he wants. I always find this film on every top 10 list, and I always find flaws with it. The editing isn't seamless either. Great film. But not a perfect film.",positive
"Don't know what to say ... its simply a masterpiece ...Great line-up, Coppola was brilliant ... Nino rota made a masterpiece that would be remembered for ages and ages ... Simply its a legendary movie",positive
"Classic, First mob movie i seen and i was young probably not a good idea i was scared for a while haha",positive

"Superb and wonderfully crafted film. It is an original piece of work that beyond doubt has held a legacy for a long time and is the influence for other famous movies. As we explore the world of the Mafia, the mobs that inhabit parts of NYC from the Tattaligas to the most feared gang in all of NYC the Corleone's. A gang that shows no mercy and is owned by the Godfather Vito Corleone played superbly and magnificently by Marlon Brando. The story takes us form the fall of Vito Corleone to the rise of his son Michael Corleone and their reign over all the mob and all of New York City. The story is well crafted, and leaves no gaps. It fills in so much information for all the characters and their conflicts and troubles that land them in the biggest crime origination in history.Basically the whole assessment of it from the direction to the acting is just astounding and it is one of a kind. Also probably the first epic Mafia film",positive
One of the greatest movies of all time!,positive

One of the best that was ever created!!!,positive
"Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, with screenplay by Puzo and Coppola. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and James Caan. The story spans ten years from late 1945 to 1955 and chronicles the life of the Corleone crime family. The Godfather was initially ranked as the third greatest film in American cinematic history (behind Citizen Kane and Casablanca) on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list by the American Film Institute. It has now been re-ranked number two under Citizen Kane, with number three being Casablanca.It is also the top movie on Internet Movie Database's Top 250 list,as well as Metacritic's top 100 list and Rotten Tomatoes' all-time best list. Two sequels followed, The Godfather Part II in 1974 and The Godfather Part III in 1990. The story begins as ""Don"" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia ""family"", oversees his daughter's wedding. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and ""family"". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don's fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the family. Written by Charlie Ness Vito Corleone is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart. This film has that rare ability to affect you even after repeated viewings. <div style=""width:800px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com/movie/the-godfather-photos/-9847371""><img src=""http://content9.flixster.com/photo/98/47/37/9847371_gal.jpg"" border=""0""/></a><div style=""text-align:center;font-size:10px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com"">Flixster</a> - Share Movies</div></div>",positive

a classic. Brando is a class byhimself. He deserves the oscar for his role,positive

"In a word, it is a classic!",positive
YEAH BABY. YOUR FAMILY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.,positive
"'The Godfather', the first part in Francis Ford Coppola's classic crime trilogy, is an almost perfect movie, with every aspect of it working to its advantage. Before this film, Coppola wasn't known much for his directorial skills. But the mastery of art he showed with this masterpiece amazed everyone. From Marlon Brando's stunning makeover to the incredible acting of almost every member of the cast, Gordon Willis' spectacular cinematography, tight editing, the remarkable background score (Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola), and almost everything else in the movie is quite flawless. No matter how many times you watch it, from the opening scene with Don Vito being asked for a favour at his daughter's wedding, to the final scene with door closing on Don Michael, the new ruthless boss of the Mafia family, the movie's three-hour long runtime captivates you till the very end. It's unlike most other crime movies with too many plot twists, action sequences, etc. The film is quite character-driven. It mainly shows the transformation of the character Michael Corleone, the war hero returning home during his sister Connie's wedding. Michael was the innocent and reluctant one in the family, who always stayed away from the family business. After certain events, he is compelled to take over the business, and it's sad and intriguing at the same time to see this character slowly evolve into something completely different from what Vito, Michael or any of us had expected. Ultimately, it's a movie all about family. Marlon Brando was not even 50 when he gives his Oscar-winning incredible performance as the head of the Corleone family. Al Pacino, who plays the central character, gets his career launched with this movie, and shows what he's capable of. Other supporting actors like James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, etc. - all of them give brilliant performances. There are so many scenes and dialogues in the movie which are more than memorable: the opening favour scene, the horse head on the studio head's bed, the sequences together showing the planned downfall of the family (including shooting of Don Vito), and especially, the craftily directed baptism scene, during which the family executes a few things to finally rise up. Nothing can be pinpointed in this movie to be called as flawed; it's an exceptional crime drama. It's an astute adaptation, and the movie stands on its own. But if it had a little more heart, I could have called it a flawless and perfect masterpiece.",positive
ALL HAIL THE GODFATHER THE FAMILY,positive
All gangster movies are compared to this one. Marlon Brnadon is so freaking cool in this movie.,positive
"an absolute classic, everyone should c this movie",positive
"""He'll Make You An Offer You Can't Refuse"" A globally recognizable film, sheepishly that I had put off until now. Mobs flms did not hold much interest for me earlier. Director Francis Ford Coppola is a genius! He was at his best when he directed this masterpiece.This is the movie that made stars of James Caan, Robert Duval, Diane Keaton, and Al Pacino. The movie that garnered 3 Academy Awards and 5 Golden Globes. In my books, the film of epic proportions. If you havent already seen this, it is well worth your time. This is compelling, gripping and intense on so many levels. A cinematic treat indeed!!",positive

"While the movies slow and for some people hard to get into. If you just watch the film thoroughly you see at as an exceptionally well documented and adapted film about the dirty business of mafia families. Possible the greatest movie novel adaption of all time because Francis Ford Coppola directed the film smoothly without many flaws. The film has compelling talents of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all amazingly good actors at their prime with this film. The editing and look into the lives of an American crime family are just astoundingly layered in the dysfunctional relationships of the family as you see the decline of the mafia family. It is a great example in film.",positive

"Explaine what's in this movie should be impossible. talking of the technical things, probably is one of the best movies ever made. Amazing soundtracks (when I listen to the main soundtrack I always think of the gold medal in figure skating Pluschenko won in the Turin 2006 Winter Olimpyc Games), amazing plot, amazing acting from everybody. Cite only Marlon Brando and Al Pacino would be unfair with all the others actors, but they were perfect. Also in the american version they seemed so Sicilians (infact I didn't understadn anything), and I had to watch it in Italian! Then, as Italian I could obviously not be ashamed of what this people made in America and are still making here in Italy. And it's for these reasons, when my friends try to explain to me the problems immigration is taking with it, I always remember them that the Italians create a lot of probem when they emigrated.",positive
It's a movie you can't refuse.,positive
"Before I start, I must say there were certain distraction while I watched this movie, so that may have affected the outcome. This is definately a movie I would watch again and I'll may change my review. One of the main parts of this movie that sticks out is the performances of its actors, mainly Marlon Brando. Stunning visuals and characters we can relate to. My only problem is that it gets very involved and it becomes difficult to keep up with whose killed who and why and everything. Other than that I can definately see why this movie has had such an impact on the movies and shows we watch today, epic.",positive
EXCELENTE PELICULA SIN DUDA UNA DE LAS MEJORES DE TODOS LOS TIEMPO.,positive
"A respectable movie for it's time, one of those movies you have to respect for what it did for cinema and how it influenced movies later on. However, that aside, the movie was not something I would pay money to see (I didn't; I borrowed it). The movie can certainly be entertaining: it's the classic father of all gang movies. This means it's filled with acts of betrayal, of vengeance, of ""just business"" killing, all done with stunning cold ruthlessness and apathy. Without doubt, probably a lot of the style of more modern crime and gang movies owe their inspiration to this movie. However, all of that is just superficial violence. While the movie certainly delves into more emotional and familial topics, trying to create a deeper soul and meaning to the movie, I feel this is ultimately where it just peters out. With SO MUCH in the way of family issues, and so many supporting characters and what not, the movie becomes bloated with names and faces, the likes of which you need a geneology text to keep track of. This proved no less than distracting for me, as I attempted to figure out who was who, right as people were getting killed off. The fact that everyone was always in suit and not immediately distinguisable did not help things. Editing and narrative construction was also not helpful in this regard. While the movie started out well enough, eventually a lack of scene construction, jumpiness between scenes, and a lack of explaination into what was actually occuring muddled things up for me even more. In the end, ""The Godfather"" is certainly something to respect, but age and influence doesn't necessarily make a great film automatically. While there are powerful and emotional scenes, these are tempered by a lack of narrative construction, a lack of clear scene explaination, and a cast of characters far too large to adequately care about.",negative

Still, I think that Marlon Brando gave us the best performance of his career and I'm positive that no one can ever top that. And let us not forget the amazing Al Pacino who totally blew me away in one his first and best movies. ""The Godfather"" is an unforgettable movie and one of the best of all time.

"It's great, but kinda overrated.",positive
"The reason why this film is marked the greatest of all time is because of the powerful emotional connection the audience experiences when watching it. The powerful timeless themes of family and loyalty really stand out in this, and you can't help but feel one with the characters as they fight through their struggles. The character development is truly remarkable, as we see that power corrupts even the ones who do not desire it, the progression of Michael from a boy who does not want anything to do with his family's dealings to a man who hands out the most horrific of orders is amazing to watch, all because he was trying to find some way to deal with the pain of a tragic loss. Marlon Brando stands out as the crime lord that plays many roles, from a cold killer to a grandfather playing with his grandson outside in the garden. An engaging story, unforgettable characters and the most powerful emotional connection to a screen family I have ever experienced, I can see why this movie has featured on the top of the most prestigious lists.",positive

"La famiglia mafiosa dei Corleone raccontata nei suoi riti di passaggio, dai nuovi equilibri con le altre famiglie alla lenta successione, di padre in figlio, al ruolo di padrino. Dal famosissimo romanzo di Mario Puzo il primo grande film sulla mafia rimasto impresso in modo indelebile nell'immaginario collettivo. Un affresco dell'America con molti sapori tipicamente siciliani (ed una breve parentesi del tutto siciliana), una visione della mafia probabilmente poco realistica ma piena di terribile fascino. Nessuno è più riuscito a dissociare almeno la mafia di un certo periodo con quella portata sullo schermo dalle pagine di Puzo: sia nei piccoli dettagli (basta pensare alla scena della breve lezione di cucina) che nella rappresentazione delle relazioni famigliari, che nel suo aspetto di organizzazione criminale (i ricatti e le classiche ""minacce mafiose"", nonchè gli esplosivi regolamenti di conti, la logica della fiducia, della fedeltà e della vendetta). Un mondo criminale ma pieno di codici morali rigidi ed incalpestabili come difficilmente si riesce a trovare nella società ""normale"", un ambiente in cui bene e male risultano difficilmente scindibili. E al centro di tutta la storia, dell'agire di ognuno dei protagonisti, la famiglia: la cosa più sacra, cui si deve ogni sforzo e dai cui trarre ogni energia, perché non può essere altrimenti. Eppure è proprio all'interno della famiglia che maturano tradimenti e rotture, perché già nel primo capitolo viene delineata la frantumazione della famiglia stessa, che verrà poi portata a compimento nel seguito della saga. Il film è intriso di un senso fortemente tragico di ineluttabilità, come simboleggia l'impossibilità del giovane Mike di sottrarsi ad un destino che sembrava non volere, e, in seguito, nel finale, il suo chiaro destino di solitudine. In quest' ottica la libertà di compiere una scelta individuale appare estremamente limitata, tanto che il giudizio morale sui personaggi non può non essere ambiguo o, meglio, sospeso. Una vera tragedia quindi (che assumerà poi secondo molti i toni della tragedia greca), piena di violenza insostenibile e sentimento, a cui è impossibile restare indifferenti. Ottima ed adeguata la regia di Coppola, splendida la fotografia, indimenticabile la colonna sonora di Nino Rota. E naturalmente eterno Brando, con la postura studiata, la particolare impostazione della voce, ed il cotone in bocca; ma anche Al Pacino dimostra le sue grandi capacità senza sfigurare. Molti giudicano questo primo capitolo inferiore al secondo, ma chi scrive non si sente di concordare. E' un'opera compiutissima che racchiude già tutte le tematiche e tutto l'impatto emotivo sviluppati successivamente.",positive
"Best movie I ever saw. Brando was God. Pacino, God-in-the-making. Brilliant cast, great sets and locales. Actually, I loved the book (more than I might have) after seeing this, because I could picture the faces of Brando and Pacino as Vito and Mike. Pure direction, pure acting...no effects and make-up like today! Coppola made the world an offer it can never refuse.",positive

"I know this is a stereotypical thing to say, but The Godfather is my favorite movie of all time, plain and simple. It earned that though. It isn't something that I say lightly. I'm sure anyone who reads my reviews can attest to that. Acting/Characters: I stand by the fact that Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lecter is the single greatest performance ever. The performance is, to me, why Hannibal Lecter is the greatest fictional character ever. Film or paper. However, The Godfather has the single greatest collection of fantastic performances ever. James Caan as Sonny, Robert DuVall as Tom, Diane Keaton as Kay, Talia Shire as Connie, John Cazale as Fredo, Al Pacino as Michael, and of course, the biggest performance of all, Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. I gotta tell you, The Godfather should have won more than one acting award. Heck, it should have won more than 3 Oscars overall. I will not dispute Brando's Oscar (nor should anyone) But I do feel that Al Pacino should have won over Joel Gray. I can only hope that the academy does too. I feel that Al Pacino's character development is the best I have seen. He goes from sweet naive college boy, to """"I gotta do this for the family"", to ""I am gonna butcher anyone who gets in my way."" He does this flawlessly. Brando also does excellent in his role as the aging Don of the powerful Corleone crime family. I enjoyed seeing how his character transformed over the course of the movie as well from the ruthless calculating Don to the old withered man saddened by the goings on around him. It is just all flawless. 10/10 Plot: I have read the book so I can say with certainty that the movie improves on the book. Usually the book is better than the movie but I enjoy the movie a lot more than I enjoyed the book. But frankly, the book is still excellent. The movie could not have been done without the book and I am glad that Puzo worked on the movie with Coppola. It helped the movie become what it is simply because you don't have an author who resents it. Few things can hurt a movie based on a popular book more than an author who is against the movie every step of the way. In this case the author helped refine the movie. I feel that the plot of the movie is one of the best I have seen. It held my attention throughout the entire movie (quite a feat considering the 3 hour running time). I won't go into more detail because i don't give away plot details and it is better that you don't know anything going in, but I will say this quote from my father: most movies these days just dump the plot on your lap and say ""here you go enjoy"" The Godfather simply whispers it in your ear. I fully agree. 10/10 Screenplay: ""Well let me tell you something my Kraut Mick friend, I'm gonna make so much trouble for you, you won t know what hit you!"" ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" ""Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your daughter... 's wedding... on the day of your daughter's wedding. And I hope their first child be a masculine child. I pledge my ever-ending loyalty."" ""Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do..."" ""YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN! What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? ""Oh, what do I do? What do I do?"" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!"" ""Leave the gun. Take the Cannoli."" as you can probably guess, I hold the screenplay of this film in higher regard than I do the screenplay of Casablanca. I know that the screenplay is one of the reasons that the characters are so good. the actors of this film had so much to work with with the screenplay that it was impossible for actors of that caliber to fail. 10/10 Likableness: I don't feel that I need to say anything more about why I feel that this film is the best film ever. I just urge those of you who haven't seen it to do so ASAP. 10/10 Final Score: 40/40 100% (P) (Stamp of perfection) TRIVIA TIME: 1. Some people considered for the role of Vito Corleone: Ernest Borgnine, Edward G. Robinson, Orson Welles, Danny Thomas, Richard Conte, Anthony Quinn, George C. Scott, Burt Lancaster, Carlo Ponte, Frank Sinatra and Laurence Olivier. 2. According to an August 1971 article by Nicholas Pileggi in The New York Times, a supporting cast member became so committed to his role that he accompanied a group of Mafia enforcers on a trip to beat up strike breakers during a labor dispute. But the enforcers had the wrong address and were unable to find the strike breakers. The actor's name was not revealed. 3. Mafia crime boss Joe Colombo and his organization The Italian-American Civil Rights League started a campaign to stop the film from being made. According to Robert Evans in his autobiography, Colombo called his home and threatened him and his family. Paramount received many letters during pre-production from Italian-Americans - including politicians - decrying the film as anti-Italian. They threatened to protest and disrupt filming. Producer Albert S. Ruddy met with Colombo who demanded that the terms ""Mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" not be used in the film. Ruddy gave them the right to review the script and make changes. He also agreed to hire League members (read: mobsters) as extras and advisers. The angry letters ceased after this agreement was made. Paramount owner Charlie Bluhdorn read about the agreement in The New York Times and was so outraged that he fired Ruddy and shut down production. But Evans convinced Bluhdorn that the agreement was beneficial for the film and Ruddy was rehired. 4. The early buzz on the film was so positive that a sequel was planned before the film was finished filming. 5. Gianni Russo used his organized crime connections to secure the role of Carlo Rizzi, going so far as to get a camera crew to film his own audition and send it to the producers. However, Marlon Brando was initially against having Russo, who had never acted before, in the film; this made Russo furious and he went to threaten Brando. However, this reckless act proved to be a blessing in disguise: Brando thought Russo was acting and was convinced he would be good for the role. 6. Marlon Brando wanted to make Don Corleone ""look ""like a bulldog,"" so he stuffed his cheeks with cotton wool for the audition. For actual filming, he wore a mouthpiece made by a dentist; this appliance is on display in the American Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York. 7. The cat held by Marlon Brando in the opening scene was a stray the actor found while on the lot at Paramount, and was not originally called for in the script. So content was the cat that its purring muffled some of Brando's dialogue, and, as a result, most of his lines had to be looped. 8. During an early shot of the scene where Vito Corleone returns home and his people carry him up the stairs, Marlon Brando put weights under his body on the bed as a prank, to make it harder to lift him. 9. Marlon Brando did not memorize most of his lines and read from cue cards during most of the film. 10. Director Francis Ford Coppola worked with relatives in this film, (making it a family film in many contexts). In chronological order of appearance: - his sister Talia Shire portrayed Connie Corleone throughout the trilogy - his mother Italia Coppola serves as an extra in the restaurant meeting - his father Carmine Coppola is the piano player in the Mattress sequence - his sons Gian-Carlo Coppola and Roman Coppola can be seen as extras in the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo, and at the funeral - and his daughter Sofia Coppola is the baby Michael Rizzi in the baptism (she was three weeks old at the time of shooting). 11. Don Vito Corleone's distinctive voice was based on real-life mobster Frank Costello. Marlon Brando had seen him on TV during the Kefauver hearings in 1951 and imitated his husky whisper in the film. 12. The film makes use of a variety of Italian words: - Paulie says ""sfortunato"", which in Italian means ""What a unlucky guy!"" (ironic), referring to Carlo (wedding scene). - Michael explains that Tom is a ""consigliere,"" or a counselor; - Vito calls Johnny Fontane a ""finocchio,"" an offensive term for a homosexual - Sonny refers to Paulie as a ""stronzo,"" a term equivalent to ""asshole"" - Carlo and Connie both say ""vaffanculo"" during their fight, which means ""fuck you"" - Don Zaluchi calls the sale of drugs to children as an ""infamita,"" or an infamy - and both the Dons Corleone use the word ""pezzonovante,"" which means "".95 caliber,"" or more accurately meaning ""big shot"". 13. George Lucas put together the ""Mattress Sequence"" (the montage of crime scene photos and headlines about the war between the five families) as a favor to Francis Ford Coppola for helping him fund American Graffiti. He asked not to be credited. George Lucas used photos from real crime scenes in the Mattress Sequence. One of the most prominent photos shows two cops kneeling beside what looks like a man sleeping on the ground with his head propped up against a fence. That man is Frank ""The Enforcer"" Nitti, Al Capone's right-hand man who had, in fact, committed suicide with a gunshot to the head. 14. The actor playing Luca Brasi, Lenny Montana, was so nervous about working with Marlon Brando that, in the first take of their scene together, he flubbed some lines. Francis Ford Coppola liked the genuine nervousness and used it in the final cut. The scenes of Brasi practicing his speech were added later. 15. At the meeting in the restaurant, Sollozzo speaks to Michael in Sicilian so rapid subtitles could not be used. He begins with: ""I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here."" When Michael returns from the bathroom, he continues in Sicilian with: ""Everything all right? I respect myself, understand, and cannot allow another man to hold me back. What happened was unavoidable. I had the unspoken support of the other Family dons. If your father were in better health, without his eldest son running things, no disrespect intended, we wouldn't have this nonsense. We will stop fighting until your father is well and can resume bargaining. No vengeance will be taken. We will have peace. But your Family should interfere no longer."" 16. Al Pacino's maternal grandparents emigrated to America from Corleone, Sicily, just as Vito Corleone had. 17. During filming, James Caan and Gianni Russo did not get along and were frequently at loggerheads. During filming Sonny's beating on Carlo, Caan nearly hit Russo with the stick he threw at him, and actually broke two of Russo's ribs and chipped his elbow. 18. Jewish actors James Caan and Abe Vigoda portray Italian characters (Santino Corleone, Salvatore Tessio), while Italian Alex Rocco, portrays a Jewish character (Moe Greene). 19. The only comment Robert Duvall will make about his performance is that he wished ""they would have made a better hairpiece"" for his character.",positive
"I really don't understand why this movie is so much loved and held in high esteem. I found it to be boring, pretentious and overblown both in run time and characterization. Maybe I just can't relate to snobby repulsively self-involved mobsters - but then who would really want to?",negative
"As the last person on the planet who hasn't seen it I feel a little bit like will smith in I AM LEGEND. Although, that's a lie, because I have seen it now, and it's fantastic. First up ,acting. Acting is an important part of films, and it helps when the actors can actually act. It helps even more if they're absolutely brilliant. Marlon Brando does more than a good job. He does an iconic job. He is the definitive mob boss. Al pachino plays another fantastic part, fantastically. Playing the role of the son, who is in a sense forced to lead the family, yet he does so with a ruthless determination. All the other characters are perfectly done by their actors aswell, yet it's still Brando and Pachino that stand out like the sun among stars. The script, is a masterpiece. Lines from this film have become our culture. It perfectly meshes with the acting performances. I also particularly liked the camera work. Every shot seems like there's a point to it. There is. The soundtrack for all this is wonderful. Music that tells a story all on it's own. Haunting, beautiful and memorable. The story is, in my mind, what truly makes this film more than just a fantastic film, and into an actual work of art. To tell the story of this film would be like trying to explain the basic point of the bible. It's a story of people at war. A story of corruption, love, hate, revenge, age, life, death and even more. Often the story trails off purely for the point of you finding out more about the characters. Things that are mentioned in conversations becomes entire plot arcs. Much of the beginning barely even matters. It's simply an introduction to see who the people are. Yet it's interesting. The film could almost certainly be an hour shorter, but it's not, and that's why it's so great. It's the unflinching vision of a great director at his best, and editing that would be like making the Mona Lisa prettier or cutting bits out of Mozarts 41st symphony to make it shorter. Some films are able to observe our culture, and make us observe it. Some imitate our culture, but rarely do films actually become a part of our culture, and even rarer are they ever this good. Is it perfect? No. Is that a good thing? Yes. It sounds stupid but it's for some reason true with this film. And time has only made it more clear it seems. I'm not sure if it's my favourite film, but I know this. This film is the best. The nuances are the very things that make it great. In short, this film is the greatest film of all time, and you owe it to yourself to watch it.",positive

"What more needs to be said about The Godfather? Francis Ford Coppola turns the tale of an American mafia organization into a sweeping, heart-breaking epic about one thing above all...family. No film in history can boast of so many iconic performances, from Brando's patriarchal Don Vito to James Caan's brutish Sonny to Pacino's idealistic but calculating Michael. Absolutely riveting, quite possibly the greatest of all time!",positive

The king of Gangsta films! Well a toss up between II but what the christmas was III. Shite!,positive
"With the internal tension and drama during the movie production, The Godfather succeeded on setting an example and redefining the cinematic industry; and if that's not amazing, I don't know what is. I hate sounding all cliche, but the movie really blew me away - all aspects of the film were perfect. The Godfather gets better every time I see it. 10/10",positive

"The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that. The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination. But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability. As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years. The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two. However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing. To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against. I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible. The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous. The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.",positive

A esta deberian darle 15 estrellas!!,positive
"An anti-mythic version of American history. The standard tropes are there: immigrant roots and rags to riches, but what roots, and what a way to get those riches. The Godfather gives us a violent mosaic rather than benign melting pot, and extends the old aphorism 'every great fortune starts with a great crime' to 'every great fortune requires crime to maintain it.' This is a story that should be worked into high school US history curricula. Except for Diane Keaton, the acting is remarkable (I think part of the problem is the dialogue she's given; she's better in the sequel). The movements from wedding to study, from action to character studies, from violence to conversation, are seamless. The movie gives us characters who we like even though we know they do awful things and throws us from the raw (the execution of Santino) to the poignant (Tom breaking down before the Godfather) in a blink. A lot like our own lives, in other words.",positive

"""Someday - and that day may never come - I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this justice as gift on my daughter's wedding day"" 10/10 A superb cast, an epic scale, masterful direction and atmosphere. Nothing more needs to be said about Coppola's cinematic masterpiece. It is one of the greatest accomplishments in cinema and continues to entrance and influence to this day. Portraying organized crime and viewing the criminals as humans, not scum. The Godfather showcases a crime family's struggles through the course of a decade. All the cast bring their absolute best and create some of the most iconic performances in film history. A grand scale and brilliant direction allow this crime epic to outshine almost every movie in existence. The Godfather is the pinnacle of filmmaking. One can not truly appreciate cinema without having seen this film, an epic masterwork.",positive
For me this still is better than Goodfellas and Casino.,positive

"Francis Ford Coppola's timeless classic that created the beginning of the saga of the most feared family ever to come out of Hollywood and onto our screens. Godfather is just simply a perfect movie, the acting is of the very highest standard and despite being nearly 3 hrs long is just a sheer joy from start to finish. No words can describe just how important this movie is and what its influence has been on the crime/gangster genre over the years...Epic",positive

good old classic mafia movie,positive
"La mayoria de la gente que ha visto The Godfather la ve como un "" gangster movie"" comprandola con tales peliculas como Scarface que solo celebran la violencia de sus personajes sobre todo lo demas. The Godfather va mucho mas alla que cualquier pelicula de ""gangster"", es un drama extremadamente profundo donde se tocan tales temas como la corrupcion del hombre a causa de poder, la familia y tradiciones culturales. A traves de la familia Corleone, Francis Ford Coppola nos hace sentir una amplia gama de emociones y dudamos de la moral de parte de esta familia. Increiblemente fotografiada, actuada y escrita, y con su nostalgica banda sonora, The Godfather es claramente de las mejores pelicuals hechas en la historia.",positive
It's the Godfather. Need I say more.,positive
"Bored me to death when I first watched on video. Later saw it rereleased in the theater & was struck by the cinematography. Kinda small on story & plays out really slowly, but it is beautifully made.",positive

"Words cannot describe what a brilliant film this is, nothing will ever better it, fabulous acting and very gripping stuff.",positive
"One of the greatest films ever made also signalled one of the greatest comebacks by an actor of all time. Marlon Brando, after a decade of self-indulgent, often mis-understood work, returned with arguably the greatest performance American cinema had witnessed since his own turn in On The Waterfront 18 years earlier. Its no wonder Coppolla paid him out of his own pocket to do it. Coppolla also penned the score which really is phenomenal. This is cinema at its finest. When there were rumours of it being made many said it couldn't be filmed, Brando couldn't be relied upon, Pacino was too unknown, Coppolla was too excentric. They were all wrong. Out it came in 1972 and changed the face of cinema.",positive

One of th best movies ever!,positive
"I watched this masterpiece again recently and it is easily recognizable as one of the best films of all time. What makes it work so well is a tight rich story with many full characters as well as stock characters who play important roles in the major characters and their development. There is not only strength in the written dialogue, but the acting and directing as well. The cinematography and music all come together to pain a lush portrait. Of special note, pay attention to Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, his acting is very strong in this film, and there is character development you can believe in. I could make criticisms as to what the film has done for the stereotyping of Mafia films, and Italian Americans, but that is really the repercussion of a seriously effective film. While this film is a complete masterpiece, the sequel ""The Godfather Part II"" may even be better.",positive
One of the best films ever.,positive
"A movie that people with low attention spans dislike because stuff doesn't get ""blowed up"" as much as some might like. Certainly one of the greatest films ever.",positive

It goes without saying that this is one of the best movies ever made,positive

A real eye opener and gripping as you follow the tribulations of a mafia family. Some of the best cinematography I've seen,positive
"Thomas: ""This is a classic I just saw recently. It lived up to my expectations. I'm not in the group that says this is the best movie ever made (it is not quite as powerful as a lot of other movies I've seen). But still, this movie has some amazing scenes, an interesting plot with interesting themes, and several great performances. Not my favorite but it's easy to see why many call this movie a masterpiece. """,positive
One of the greats -- a must see.,positive
An incredilbe work of American cinema. Beautifully shot and with a great story. The first of the two Godfather films that is worth anything is a cultural phenominon and is one of those movies that's hard to turn off once it's on. Brando and Pacino are brilliant as is the entire cast.,positive
The greatest movie ever made!!!!,positive
Probably the best movie ever made. Love it.,positive
Do I honestly even NEED to comment?,positive
Probably the greatest cast ever! Godfather is a classic for a reason.,positive

"This movie has a great amount of drama in it. Its best mob movie ive ever seen, besides goodfellas.",positive
"I have seen 'The Godfather' many times but still find it a gripping film, which is a true test of a great film. A film you will want to watch over and over again for some incredible acting performances from Al Pacino, James Caan and Marlon Brando. This film truly is The Godfather of gangsta films, although its fair to say that the The Godfather and The Godfather part 2 are often viewed by many critics as being one film.",positive
Can you get a better movie? I love this film. LOVE it.,positive
Marlon Brando is the best Don Corleone ever!,positive
"I can't help but feel like this movie would have been better animated. The acting is sub-par, and is not worth sitting down for 3 hours to be mildly entertained. Most overrated movie ever.",negative
En Klassiker. Har du den minste interesse for mafia eller gangsterfilmer sÃ¥ er denne obligatorisk.,positive
"It's not a perfect movie. Perhaps it's because I've read the book and know what's missing. However, losing things like Fontane's or Jules' subplots don't necessarily detract from the film. Three things took away from this for me. 1) While I understand that Brando is method acting, he hams it up in a couple of places. I would argue that he may in fact be the weakest part of The Godfather, taking on a slightly cartoonish feel. Some would argue that it's because of how well The Godfather is known in popular culture, but I would argue it's because his diction and puffed out cheeks are actually gimmicky. 2) The pacing is not perfect. Each individual scene is carried out well, but at times they don't contain good transitions, and unfortunately a lot of information is lost in the translation. It honestly begins to feel rushed in the second half, yet there are also times when it drags. I would have preferred some of the other characters being more developed rather than going for atmosphere, which brings me to what I think the biggest flaw of this film. 3) Characters such as Tessio or Brasi or Greene or Woltz are introduced and then sidelined until they have their pivotal scenes. Meanwhile, much time is spent on the cinematography or the slow shots and setting development. There just isn't a good balance between the two. This is to me what really keeps it from being an absolute masterpiece. Characters like Clemenza or Connie or Hagen who are given enough screen time really shine, and it should have been that way for everyone.",positive
A classic in everyones eyes.,positive
"Finally saw this classic yesterday. Well, it seems that I can actually like a gangster/mafia film after all.... Brando was amazing. Many memorable moments. The importance of family was such a strong theme....I think that is what resonated with me, and allowed me to connect to it, despite my difficulty in connecting to other such genre films (Goodfellas, Bugsy) because I have a difficult time caring for characters (and their fates) that I do not like or find distasteful.",positive

Excellent Mafia movie. This is the best Mafia movie out of all Mafia movies. Also Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were excellent. They gave great performances in this.,positive
"When I was younger I loved this movie for the mafia aspect but now, older and wiser I love the father dynamic of Vito Corleone. A man that came to America and did what he had to to provide for his family. My new favorite part is when Vito and Michael are talking and he's telling Michael how he didn't want him to get mixed up in the family business, to be better than he was. That's all any father should want for his children.",positive

"Why so low on the list? Watchability. I love this movie. If you haven't watched it, you're missing out on one of the greatest films of all time. Yes you should likely watch it more than once too to make sure you get all the interwoven parts clear. But it is a chore to find time and desire to watch this and share it with your friends. That, and it's heavy watching. It's like the war and peace of cinema. But it is a wonderful journey, a fantastic story, it is masterfully acted, and the reward is great.",positive

"Qui suis-je pour oser écrire ces lignes en ce moment? Pour oser critiquer The Godfather, film considéré comme étant le meilleur par bon nombre de gens et classé en deuxième position par l'American Film Institute (AFI)! Tout ce que j'en dis pour l'instant, c'est que ce long-métrage de Francis Ford Cappola n'a pas eu cette popularité pour rien: Ce film aurait sa place dans le dictionnaire, juste à côté de ''parfait''. En adaptant le roman de Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Cappola m'a fait une offre que je n'ai pas pu refuser... The Godfather, situé à New York en 1945, raconte l'histoire de la famille mafieuse Corleone. Don Vito Corleone, le parrain, refuse de financer Sollozzo, travaillant avec la famille Tattaglia, dans son traffic de drogue. Tant qu'à Sonny, le fils du parrain, il décide d'accepter l'alliance. C'est une bien mauvaise idée, puisque son accord engendra une guerre sans merci entre les deux familles mafieuses. Ce film-là est tout simplement incroyable du début à la fin. Il n'est pas seulement le meilleur film de gangster, il est aussi un des meilleurs films de tous les temps! De plus, ce chef-d'uvre possède probablement une des soundtrack les plus merveilleuses. J'aimerais bien être original et vous dire que The Godfather possède quelques défauts, mais je ne le ferrais pas. Pour la simple et bonne raison que je n'en ai pas trouvé! Et puis, pourquoi chercher des bébittes comme on dit? C'est paqueté de surprises, de moments intenses, de drame, de rebondissements,... Le scénario de Mario Puzo, merveilleusement adapté par M. Ford Coppola d'ailleurs, est totalement brillant! De plus, il est rempli de dialogues savoureux dont on se rappellera encore longtemps après le visionnement. Je ne peux continuer sans parler de la performance des acteurs. Bien que James Caan, passant par Al Pacino, étaient plus qu'excellents dans leur rôles, je crois que l'unanimité (incluant moi) s'entend pour dire que la Palme d'Or revient à Marlon Brando. Il est définitivement né pour interpréter Don Vito Corleone! Il nous capte dès sa première apparition et c'est surtout de lui qu'on se souviendra! Par contre, tous les autres acteurs nous offrent des performances excellentes qui se doivent d'être soulignées. Les personnages en tant que tels sont d'ailleurs fort intéressants! Chacun étant bien énigmatique à sa façon. La famille Carleone est fascinante et c'est un pur plaisir de suivre leurs péripéties. Le film commence d'ailleurs tranquillement en nous présentant chacun des membres de cette famille, ce qui nous aide à mieux les apprécier par la suite. Ensuite, je fais une bref mention de la photographie. Celle-ci est sublime et enforcie incroyablement l'univers de The Godfather. Jouant avec les lumières, les ombrages et tout le style léché auquel nous avons droit ne peut effectivement que nous embarquer davantage dans l'ambiance dramatique du long-métrage. Dans un même ordre d'idée, les plans de caméra utilisés sont parfaitement bien choisit afin de montrer exactement ce qu'il faut et parfois en faire suggérer davantage que ce qui nous est montré. Le tout aide à l'intensité de certaines scènes. Effectivement, bien que l'action semble peu présente dans le film, lorsqu'il y en a, l'impact est triplé! Triplé non-seulement parce que ces scènes sont surprenantes, mais aussi parce qu'elles sont violentes à souhait! Avec, en plus, un effet lumineux sombre, une atmosphère inquiétante de réalisme et la theme song du film, nous obtenons le cocktail rêvé pour des scènes destinées à devenir cultes! J'y penses: Peut-être que The Godfather possède un défaut! Le film dure tout de même un bon trois heures. Pour quelqu'un d'habitué ou un adorateur du cinéma comme moi, il n'y a aucun problème. Néanmoins, je me met dans la peau de quelqu'un qui ne fait que regarder des comédie-romantiques d'une heure et demi et je me dis qu'un drame comme The Godfather n'est peut-être pas pour lui. Je n'ai rien contre les comédie-romantiques, détrompez-vous! Mais je crois que ça pourrait être assommant ou même assez lourd pour ce genre de gens. Pour ma part, comme je l'ai déjà mentionné, ça ne m'a pas dérangé du tout.et cette remarque ne change absolument pas la note finale que je lui accorde! Pour ce qui est de la finale, nous assistons à un moment touchant. Je parles de la scène avec le petit garçon. Sans être une fin à sauter au plafond, l'histoire est bien conclue et offre une belle porte d'ouverture pour The Godfather: Part II. En conclusion, The Godfather est un classique à ne pas manquer pour les intéressés. À la fois dramatique, touchant, choquant peut-être, ce film est un délice avec lequel on tombera amoureux dès le premier visionnement. Je vous averti, ça dure trois heures, mais ça vaut la peine. Un casting impressionnant qui offre des performances inoubliables dans des personnages attachants: Que demander de plus? Une bonne musique et une ambiance de gangstérisme? C'est déjà fait! En fait, The Godfather est lui-même le Godfather des films de gangster par excellence! Ni plus ni moins.",positive
Can you find a more boring and complete waste of film? These actors are of the highest caliber and their skills couldn't even make this movie a 1 star. How/why people are interested/fascinated by this type of movie I will never know.,negative
"Utterly and perfectly exquisite. That Copolla boys knows his onions, and in this film he served them with garlic, olive oil and a liberal sprinkling of blood. The cast don't put a foot wrong, the music makes me tingle and the mise en scene is almost unwatchably gorgeous.",positive

Godfather is like none other. Marlon Brando steals the spotlight but does not out shine his brilliant co-stars. Yet another classic.,positive
Such a wonderfully told Family saga. Epic film with epic performances,positive
"Classic. I can see this over and over and still say ""That's a great movie""",positive
So glad I finally watched it.,positive
"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.. With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day.. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. This is definetely a ""must see"" masterpiece.",positive
Classic movie about Mafia family in New York with The Godfather Brando,positive
"Arguably the greatest movie ever made. It still holds it's own after all these years. A great cast and just as engrossing now as it was then. Whenever it's on TV, I find I have to watch it.",positive

The best gangster film ever made........end of. The sequels aren't too bad either. If you like world class acting and writing this is for you. A must for any movie collection.,positive

As good as films get. Have watched this and pt. 2 more times than healthy,positive
"this is the best movie ever made and i have seen alot of movies so its saying alot its a mob movie but it is much more than that it is about family loyalty it just has an amazing storyline with great characters it has some of the best actors ever marlon brando, robert duvall, james caan, and al pacino and robert deniro was in part 2 nothing has really taken over as a better movie since its release in 1972 there r movies that r plenty of movies out there that r really good i just cant say there better than it though",positive
"Tom Hanks in the movie âYou got mailâ, suggests, the answers to all life's questions can be found in The Godfather. I know how it sounds but truly There's scenes that stay with you even when the movie is over, and you don't forget them. Is it a movie about crime or is it really a movie about family?",positive

Pretty good. A bit over-rated.,positive

I couldn't get past the beginning. Yawn :S,negative
All around great filmmaking. Only criticism I have is Michael's transformation into becoming even more ruthless than his father. Other then that though top notch on all counts.,positive
THE BEST FILM EVER!!!,positive
"I don't consider this to be the great classic it is commonly cited as being, but it's a reasonably stylish film. Better than the extremely entertaining but very low brow book, the film has much more ambition going for it. the acting is good, and Nino Rota's music is mindblowingly good, but I don't see all that many really unique or deep aspects in this one.",negative
"The acting, the story is amazing",positive
The book was waaaaaay better than the movie.,negative
"This movie was wayyyy tooo long but I think it is interesting how the ""good"" son turned out",positive
"Arguably the greatest american movie ever made. Epic story invovling a brilliant Marlon Brando as Don Corleone, and Al Pacino as the chillingly ruthless Michael, and a superb James Caan as the hot headed Sonny. Engrossing storyline that's only gets better with each subsequent viewing",positive
marlyn brando !!!!!....grt acting...super direction.....grt movies of all tym..,positive
"Everything about the movie is perfect down to every single last detail. The film's masterful narrative remains gripping throughout, the directing by Francis Ford Coppola is restrained and elegant, and the acting is so incredible. Obviously Marlon Brando is iconic as the Don, but Al Pacino delivers one of his greatest and the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. Pacino's subtle, shifting transformation from civilian to mafia don will never lose its power. Both Brando and Pacino are supported by a fantastic supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The emotional pull of the movie is every bit as strong as it was nearly 40 years ago, because every aspect of it is timeless. This movie will never be duplicated or surpassed. From start to finish I am completely taken over the imagery, the score, the amazing acting, the fantastic cinematography,and the screenplay is written with brilliance. To me 'The Godfather' is a better movie than the also amazing novel it's adapted from. This film is a real true masterpiece and one of the most influential films in American cinema.",positive

"The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.<br/><br/>The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their ""adopted"" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.<br/><br/>With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.<br/><br/>Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.<br/><br/>The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from ""innocent"" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was. Despite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable.<br/><br/>Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.<br/><br/>Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man"") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""throne"", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son).<br/><br/>The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it's surprising that Duvall wasn't passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn't flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan's Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can't be overlooked.<br/><br/>Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.<br/><br/>Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.<br/><br/>We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told.",positive
"Brando is superb. If you're into Mafia and the mobsters, this is THE BEST series for you!",positive
I saw it when I was 12. I'm sure this rating will go up when I watch it again. So don't flip out.,negative

"One of the most perfect films of all time, a true example of perfection and quality in acting and filmmaking. Along with Part II, these films are Coppola's definitive masterpieces, not only of his, but really some of the absolute masterpieces of all time. An admirable and brilliant piece of work, with no mistakes in acting, script and direction. A powerful and entertaining classic that always will be remembered as a true landmark in the history of cinema.",positive
The Godfather is considered a classic. I mean who has not seen this epic movie? And come oon...Marlon Brando AND Al Pacino in one movie...,positive
An engrossing look at the Italian mafia that leaves you speechless yet begging for more.,positive
"If you haven't seen this movie, you should. Today, in fact.",positive
The best film ever made. Full Stop!,positive
"There should be a prequel to The Godfather, and in it the godfather himself should be portrayed as a hero of born masculinity and that how he builds up his empire, rather than this feeble and lumberly old man we have here. I do not intend to magnify any of the weak points but I always have high expectations to big movies. If only the film was more tightknit and did not take half an hour to kill a man; if only more cool gore scenes were presented; if only it were better. Still, I should say it is an undeniable masterpiece.",positive

A film icon and a beloved part of American culture...,positive
a little longer than needs to be but a classic all the same,positive
A bit long and with poor effects that partly is accepted since it is from the 70's. Otherwise absolutely terrific.,positive
One of the best films ever made!!!!!,positive
Great beggining to the trilogy but it does not live up to its sequel.,positive
How do you know your a man? Youve seen the Godfather. Much maligned by frat douches the world over because they wish that they could be rich and bone hot chicks all day....wait......so THATS why they like it.,positive

"What can one say about the Godfather? One could say that it is the example that all gangster films after it follow. They could say it is an American classic of the highest order. They could say it set a tone in American cinema in the following decades. They would all be right. I would say that it is one of my all time favorites and even though it is 3 hours long I could watch it every day. This is one of the films that made me fall in love with movies. The first juxtaposition I saw and recognized was in this film. It made me understand what good acting was, it showed me how a film can stand the test of time and still be relatable after over 30 years. When someone asks me what my favorite movie is, I'll likely say Forrest Gump. However, when someone asks me what the best movie is...without I say The Godfather.",positive
Stunningly beautiful.,positive
Best Movie Ever Made,positive
"I love this movie, but I refuse to acknowledge any one of the series as a great movie. I believe the greatness is in the trilogy alone, and no GF movie stands on its own",positive
"Love the ending, one of the greatest. Essentially, a tale of decadence, lies, and repetition wonderfully told by Coppola.",positive
"The best of the trilogy, of course...",positive
it was good real good,positive

"56% of people on this service are NOT interested in seeing ""The Godfather""? Why the Hell would you sign up to be on a service called ""Flixster"" if you don't want to watch this film?",positive
"It's the best picture of movie history. Just think about Marlon Brando as Don Vito, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, James Caan... all of them performing so cool. It's a classic and a unmissable for a movie collector.",positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
"a great film, but not the superior masterpiece everyone yells about",positive
"Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER stands as the ultimate cinematic equivalent to opera. Nothing since has been able to (remotely) match the brilliance, beauty, and tragedy of this one-of-a-kind masterpiece.",positive
Updated Review- My opinion is still the same on this one. A good movie but definitely a tad overrated and not consistently engaging like the 2nd one.,negative
Witness the evolution of Michael Corleone,positive
I stopped watching it half way through.,negative

The epitome of mob movies -- no other will ever be this good!,positive
"In my opinion the greatest movie ever made, this film hits it home and circles the bases with a story which is nail biting, gut wrenching, awe inspiring all the way up until the final climactic seconds. All star cast including a simply amazing Marlon Brando show us a clear, detailed picture of the Mafia in New York. Awsome plot, awsome visuals, awsome acting- it really doesn't get any better than this.",positive

Probably the best movie ever made,positive
"Mike Corleone and Don Vito Corleone.. superb acting!! This is definetely a ""must see"" masterpiece",positive
I have always thought that The Godfather trilogy were a set of films that everyone should watch. We got them on Blu-Ray for Christmas and watched The Godfather Part 1 at the weekend. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it - the acting on all parts was amazing and for such a long film I found that I didn't get bored at all. It did help that the quality of the Blu-Ray was fantastic - was hard to tell that the film was originally made in 1972 ! Definitely recommended - we are going to watch Parts 2 & 3 this weekend hopefully !,positive
"one of the best films made, quality",positive
"The Godfather is incomparable. the best movie of all time. with a great cast, great performances and a fantastic plot. The history of Mario Puzo could not be better represented.",positive
Best movie ever made.,positive
such an AWESOME movie!!,positive

Brando + Pacino + Duvall = Freakin Awesome,positive
"Excellent and classic movie. Powerful and interesting to watch. Some find it hard to get into, but once you start, it's worth watching the rest.",positive
"A gem of a cinema classic guaranteed to stereotype Italian-immigrants for decades to come. I love this film! Atsa the matta for you, you gotta problem wit dat!",positive
"the first time i saw the godfather i was blown away,marlon brando as don vito goes beyond acting capability, a great role that garnered him the oscar. his manner, his stature,his elegance and his voice all make the film work, a great movie about the mafia famillies and the rise to power in america. al pacino was exceptional, all the events that lead him to becoming the new don,a college boy with a girlfriend that wanted no part in the familly buisness, kills sollozzo,frees to sicily for 6 years marries a girl, she gets killed, his intention to come back and marry kay(dianne keaton) i praise and respect francis ford copolla,he puts everything together especially the wedding scene wich you get the real fee of a typical italian familly. the hospital scene.....so much mystery and suspence... an awsome cast, storyline and great scenes....it is the mafia movie",positive
"Personally, not my all time favourite movie, but having said that I can fully understand why many consider it to be the greatest film ever made.",positive
"Old school story telling, slow paced and moody but draws you into the world it creates",positive
Don Corleone! LOVE IT!!,positive
"""A man that never spends time with his family can never be a real man""!",positive

One of the greatest movies of all time. No one can disagree.,positive

omg i love this movie i give it 5 stars,positive
I saw this movie long ago and still love it today a lot of people would say it reminds me of my family lol,positive
"Ok, I think I know what it is....I'm just not super wild about the ""gangster"", or ""Mafia"" themed movies. I like them, but they're not my favorite genre. I've heard more praise about the Godfather trilogy than almost any movie or series throughout my life, but am just getting around to watching them. I enjoyed the movie, and I'll definitely watch the other two over the next few days, but I certainly don't see it as the greatest movie ever made, or one I'd watch very often, especially not to the point where I memorize every line. Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie, but it just doesn't have that same type of appeal to me as it does most...but neither did ""Scarface"", which is why I say it's gotta be the genre. I'm more of a drama, horror, and action fan. This film features a nice cast with great performances, especially Brando. It also has many scenes and lines (""I'll give him an offer he can't refuse"") that are timeless.",negative
the original verison which is thhis one sucks,negative
"LOL, I hope some of you gave this bad reviews or ""Not Interesteds"" to make me laugh.",positive
Greatest movie in cinematic history. I'd give it 100 stars if I could. My all-time favorite movie!!!,positive
Five stars...enough said,positive
The absolute best movie of all time! Nothing compares except maybe the book itself!!!!,positive
Do I really need to explain? Yeah... didn't think so.,positive
Best Gangster flick by far,positive
"Squee! Just one left! Citizen Kane viewing/Rock Band victory party still on track for Sat. Boston area Facebook friends can expect invites soon, as Im working on that as soon as this write up is posted. I feel like no matter what I write about The Godfather, there's no way in hell I can \m/ do it justice. It just really is one of the greatest movies ever made. A fellow movie enthusist once pointed out that this is one of the few 3 hour films that uses those three hours effectively (the only other example we could come up with at the time was Magnolia, but Im sure there's a few others). And its so true. The movie is so engrossing, it just flies by. I was actually a bit concerned I'd miss movie time for Get Him to the Greek cause Id lose track of time watching this one. Still remember the first time I watched this. One of my best buddies realized that neither of us had seen this, which was abhorrent and unacceptable so we remedied that first chance we got. And both of us were just in awe, basking in the awesome of all things Italian. The characters are so cunning and complex. The plot is so twisted and terribly engrossing. The actors top notch. The direction brilliant. I also highly recommend the book. I read it a couple years ago. The movie follows it pretty accurately, but there's so much more. There's more elaborate backstories on the characters (my favorite being more stuff on Johnny Fontaine). And its a pretty easy read too. It also helps clear up some of the confusion, or at least I still cant keep a lot of people and motives straight. Guess I should prolly stop cause all Im doing is gushing. And Im getting sleepy. http://expletivedleted.livejournal.com http://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted",positive
America's obsession with the Mafia and crime owe a debt of gratitude to the film that started it all. Incredible performances in one of the most indelible and highly-quoted films of all time.,positive

Very GOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDD,positive

"Living (?) proof that I don't hate ALL films that you've heard of and like (just most of them). I don't like mob films generally because I'm like so totttttttalllly not into that stuff, but the 'Godfather' is just too good a film to deny it it's deserved place as one of films all time bests.",positive
"This is a classic, and I can understand why people often rate this as their #1 movie of all time. It reaches all audiences and is probably the best directed movie ever...not to mention best acted",positive

come on every body likes this one .need i say more?!,positive
I am a fan of Mario Puzo's stories!,positive
My favourite movie. Brando was amazing actor. Pacino is also great.,positive
"Epic tale, epic movie, epic characters. A definite ""must see"" of it's genre.",positive
"Overrated but good, and better than the second one. Glad I watched this again, as it seems my memory wasn't quite right. As I suspected from watching Part 2 recently, my biggest problem with the series is that I can't stand Michael. But with Part 2 fresh in my mind and Part 1 fuzzy, I was thinking that Michael had been a good guy determined to stay straight until circumstances pushed him to take up his father's bloody mantle. Well, it didn't take much pushing. I had assumed that Michael stayed clean for a while of his own will, but it seems that was actually Vito's will. And whatever his violent doings, Vito, whether played by Brando or De Niro, has a certain charm and even humanity to him that Michael sorely lacks. Michael is a detestable, soulless bastard with no redeeming qualities. I don't think he's meant to be a particularly sympathetic character, but having such a figure at the core of a story, let alone a trilogy, is a considerable problem for me, however well done the films may be otherwise.",positive
One of the best movies ever made. Awesome cast. Great director. The mother of all mob flicks.,positive
best bro flick of all-time!,positive
Fuckin' ace. Go watch this if you haven't.,positive
if you give this less than 4 stars.. (dramatic pause),positive
"The Godfather is a well crafted film of inner workings of a mafia family in the 1940s. It is interesting to see on how close the family is and how they watch out for another back. The film shows how there family did business and how it was run in organize crime of gambling and alcohol. The main godfather that is brilliantly play by Marlon Brando is the head of the family who is steering there criminal organization on how he thinks it should be lead. It also have well acted performances by Al Pacino, Robert Duvail, James Caan, Diane Keaton and others. It is a violent film as it shows on how things are sometimes handle that might end in bloodshed when ideas and views greatly differ or because of revenge. It is fantastically directed by Franis Ford Coppola as it gives you the right atmosphere on how things are handle in the mafia, as it feels each scene is a good dictation of how the mafia works and is. It also has a good sound track. This cult classic is a for sure film that should be view for its excellent style and fabulous cast.",positive
"I know I should LOVE this movie...but my God it was boring. Yeah, I said it...",negative
One of those films that always pulls you in no matter what part you come into. My dad's favorite film of all time and has become one of mine as well. Forget the gangster stuff. This is about family. Fathers and sons and the bonds they form. The Sicily sequence is a reminder of why I went into film making in the first place.,positive
I think this is as close a movie is ever going to get to being perfect. Nothing more to say.,positive

"UP there on the greatest films of all time list. How can you not love this movie? The Drama, the loyalty, the passion. This film is a work of art and every scene is a gem to look at. Al Pacino is incredible as the youngest son in the family trying to be a leader and avenge his father. Marlon Brando,you can't say enough. Godfather=must see",positive
one of the greatest movies ever made !,positive
I'm not worthy of rating this movie. Neither are you.,positive
"So it's my years mission to get right back into the art of cinema this year! So random-ness, classic and arty-ness ahoy! I watched The God Father a year ago, and got half way through The God Father 2 before giving up. Gangster films are just not my thing... But on watching it last night, I finally got it. If you're patient there's amazing character studies and an epic story following a young man?s fall into his Father's way of life. Although the story spans years, it feels quite intimate - probably because most of the scenes are focused on family - even if not by blood. 'Keeping it in the family' as they say. Marlon Brando is amazing, and has become his character fully - an example of a fine actor (even with the mumbling). I'm still giving it 4 and 1/2 stars though - merely because it wouldn't usually be my cup of tea, and I'm not sure if I'd watch it again. But it's funny how opinions can change...even over a year...",positive

One of my favorite scenes is Vito in the garden with his grandson. I don't usually listen to director comments but made an exception for this movie. That scene was filmed against the studio's wishes in one take. Two cameras, one take. Unbelievable.",positive

Awesum is nt the word...,positive
"This is a classy series, the whole thing.",positive
"Masterful, sprawling example of the power of cinematic storytelling. It's not just the events which are notable, but the way in which every incident is memorably potrayed which keeps the Godfather in one's psyche long after the film itself has finsihed. Fundamentally, though, it succeeds by doing what was difficult in the early seventies: making the monsters it portrays seem human, frail and worthy of our empathy.",positive
It doesn't get any better,positive
the book is so much better.,positive
"This is without a doubt the best movie made in the entire history of cinema, which changed the industry for ever. A triumph with out equal.",positive
The new restoration of the film supervised by Coppola himself looks WONDERFUL. It breathes new life into what was previously a dark and dull picture.,positive

"Mario puzzo wrote this , i read it at the age of 1, too early , it states, The Godfather is a 1972 crime drama film based on the 1969 novel of the same name by Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, with a screenplay by Puzo, Coppola, and an uncredited Robert Towne.[2] It stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte and Diane Keaton, and features John Cazale and Abe Vigoda. The story spans ten years from 1945 to 1955 and chronicles the Italian-American Corleone crime family.",positive

"Coppola's classic account of one man's rise to power within the New York Mafia of the 1940's. Amasing film, oft imitated never duplicated. So many classic lines and scenes you can't havemissed this and call yourself a movie fan.",positive
"Extremely dialogue-heavy, but it is helpful in setting up the environment that the Corleone family lived in. Still, a classic",positive
Best mafia movie. ever.,positive
"This is one of the most beautifully made films I have ever seen. The lighting, framing, and color are stunning. The only complaint I have is that it was 3 hours long. Also the street fight scene almost ruined the movie for me. The fight scene in Bridget Jones' Diary was better.",positive
"The first time I watched THE GODFATHER, I wasn't all that impressed. Watching it now, though, I can't help but adore it. It's a beautifully shot and constructed film about a mafia family and their moral values. First-rate performances by a top-notch cast serve the film wonderfully, and the impeccable direction by Francis Ford Coppola give the film a flow that causes the nearly three-hour running time to just fly by. An undeniable masterpiece.",positive

"I'm suprised this was made in the 70s...surely it looked very contemporary!Anyway, excellent film! It was really slow in the beginning, but then as the film moved forward, it was interesting to watch. It shows the way organized crime works and each character in the film was fantastic. I watched only parts of this movie back in the day, but to see it in full...I am glad I did! I didn't even know that was Al Pacino (Michael) in the film...he was cute back then. lol. This is an ultimate classic that everyone's got to see!",positive

A great film that only loses half a star because I don't care for Diane Keaton as an actress enough that she detracts a bit from the whole experience. But otherwise this movie is a real classic. Great performances and lots of depth. This is one of those rare occasions where the film is better than the novel.,positive
Italians are complex. Brando at his best.,positive
"Really, what is there to say. If you've heard it and its good, its true. If you've heard it and its bad, its not true. There is an answer to everything this film, you just need to notice it. the performances of each and every charecter are so captivating you forget that you're watching a movie, which is helped by the fact that this film never becomes out dated. it will forever remain ahead of the curve.",positive
A classic if there ever was one!!,positive
a masterpiece.wont muck it up by adding to it.,positive
This movie makes you and offer you can't refuse.,positive
"So my psychiatrist told me I should do these movies last. They're the greatest movies ever made, he said, and after I've seen them, I will never want to see another movie ever again, because it simply won't measure up. Now, for someone who's been averaging a movie a day or more for [i]years[/i], that's a bold statement, and it frankly isn't true. For example, my copy of [i]Sleeping Beauty[/i] just arrived in today's mail, and I'm really looking forward to that, though it is a [i]very[/i] different movie. However, I'll admit to being rather stunned, an effect not least caused by the fact that, given running times, I've just sat through some nine hours of [i]Godfather[/i] in a row. That's a very intense viewing experience. The simple summary of the plot is that it's the story of a family. In The Beginning, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is preparing to celebrate the wedding of his daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Various supplicants come to him, and then finally, he is able to join his family. In addition to his daughter and new son-in-law, Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), he has sons Michael (Al Pacino), Fredo (John Cazale), and Sonny (James Caan). Don Vito is a mob boss, though he would probably be horrified if you used so crude a term at him. He is, simply, the Godfather. Yes, it's true that he pretty much twists Michael's arm into joining the family business, but it's only because he wants the best for his family. Much of the problem, here, comes from people wanting the best for their family. Part II traces the rises of both Vito (played in flashback by Robert DeNiro, who won a Best Supporting Oscar for a primarily-Italian role) and Michael. Part III shows an older, wiser Michael letting his son choose his own path, but that old ""the best for my family"" still causes nothing but heartbreak for the Corleones. In this case, it's what's best for love-struck Mary (Sofia Coppola, more on whom anon), whose object of affection, tragically, is her own cousin, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia). Michael is trying to get away from the life, but, as he says, they keep sucking him back in. There are three bloodbaths in Part III, and they're all visually stunning--but bad news for the Corleones, even when it seems to help them. No, I had never seen these movies before. Yes, it's a shocking failure on my part. I grant you. I hang my head in shame. My only defense is that I just don't care that much for mafia movies. I don't really like movies that are all about people getting shot up, and there's a lot of shooting in your average mafia movie. And, Gods know, there's a lot here--I don't know what the body count for the trilogy is, but it's [i]high[/i]. However, having seen them, I'm certain that I will watch them--yes, all three--again someday. We watch Michael Corleone grow and change and warp, and that's more important to the whole thing than the business. Heck, except for the shooting scenes, we don't actually see much of the business. We see Don Vito reject the idea of dealing drugs, and we see Don Michael get in on the ground floor of Vegas and the end days of Havana. But mostly, it's the family. On the subject of family, let us discuss, briefly, poor, maligned Sofia Coppola. I went into Part III knowing that it was the weakest of the three (true), and that Sofia Coppola gives the worst performance known to modern cinema. Now, as you know, I watch a [i]lot[/i] of movies. Thousands, all told, more than any three average people my age. I am here to tell you, I have seen quite a lot of much worse performances. I have seen performances that make me want to gouge out my own eyes at the sheer inanity, and I can promise you that Sofia Coppola isn't anywhere near that bad. She's a little stiff, and she never really builds much chemistry with Andy Garcia, but she's not as awful as you have heard. Hells, just this summer, Liv Tyler was worse in [i]The Incredible Hulk[/i]--but both women had the same problem, really. It's hard for any novice actress, or any mid-level actress, to hold the screen against performers of the calibre of a Pacino or even a Norton. In a worse movie, she would have seemed better. In an average movie, no one would have noticed. But this is a [i]Godfather[/i] movie. So. It is still true that Part III is the weakest, but to be the weakest [i]Godfather[/i] movie is praising with faint damns. I can still get into the plot; I can see where the hungry young Michael of I and II becomes the weary old Michael of III. After all, he is losing everything that really matters to him. His first wife died in a car bomb meant for him. His second wife can barely stand the sight of him, hated him enough to leave her children behind. And, as the ending shows us, the family still has the Corleone touch. It's pretty gruesome, probably more so than anything else in the series, but it's not really unexpected. What strikes me most about all three movies is how they end. The end of the first one is one of those moments in film discussed in hushed tones wherever film buffs meet. It's one of the ultimate symbols of distance growing between a couple; it's the closest any other film has ever gotten to the growing breakfast table of [i]Citizen Kane[/i]. However, stunning a moment as it is, I think the ending of Part II has even more pathos. We are too far away to see Michael's face, but it wouldn't matter if we were. There would be no expression there anyway. And I [i]like[/i] the ending of Part III. The world has shifted out from under Michael, and at long last, he cannot make himself a place in it. Probably he doesn't even wish to. He cannot even have his father's end, keeling over peacefully in the tomato garden with his grandson at his side.",positive

One of the best ever!,positive
DIDNT KNOW WHO YOU WERE WITH..,positive
So much has been said about this series I find it hard to say anything else particularly meaningful. I personally don't particularly enjoy watching these films (I find it pretty heavy going) but at the same time I still acknowledge that they are incredibly well made. Part I shows without a doubt why Pacino's career took off the way it did.,positive
"Coppola was right when he insisted on Pacino in the role of Michael Corleone. The arc of the on-screen transformation from Michael's first scene, at the wedding with Kay, to the last scene with Kay watching as a man kisses Michael's hand, pledging his loyalty to the Godfather, is brilliant. Three hours long, but necessary to provide the detail and context for an epic story. Godfather II is equally masterful. Godfather III could be likened to Fredo: weak, shiftless,dim-witted, inarticulate. It was a terrible story line, and Sophia Coppola gave perhaps one of the worst performances on film EVER. Glad she found directing instead.",positive
"Absolutely without a doubt, one of the most, well-made films in history. The use of deep contrast light illuminates the tensions and feelings for Brando's character. The use of diegetic sound occurring outside the sequence of action is deep foreshadowing of the events bound to occur. The character he once hated becomes the character that he is. Many say that there's a few sequels that outshine the original story, I don't think so. Godfather Part 2 comes close to rivaling the original, but the first one simply takes the gold.",positive

"An engaging look inside a fictional world of New York City organized crime. The acting -- especially from Brando and Pacino -- is spectacular. As is the direction, cinematography, and so forth, as many people tell you. Somehow, though, I have discovered myself past the point where I'm drawn so completely in by this glorified gangster life, and found myself at an intellectual crossroads, asking myself ""Is this movie defensible as good art?"" Well, with what said about the acting, direction, etc., I'd say, ""Sure sure."" Beyond the charisma of its presentation and personalities, however, is it anything beyond an epic work of escapism, putting us safely behind the screen from a dangerous but compelling parallel reality? Not really. For us, the average Joe on the grind, it's nothing more than good -- but I'd argue, not great, based on the simple nature of its plot -- fantasy.",positive

"Hand down, The Godfather is amongst the top ten American films ever made. In addition, Godfather II raised the bar even higher. Let us not think about Godfather III. Nevertheless, The Godfather is still Francis Ford Coppolas cinematic masterpiece and the film he will be remembered for. Not too many films stand the test of time but this film is enduring and sucks you into it whenever it is on. Coppola knows how to spot talent and gave star turns to up and comers Al Pacino and James Caan. He also brought back Marlon Brando from his career exile and turned him into a hot commodity again. Who else could do that but Francis Ford Coppola? The film was championed by the legendary Robert Evans who insisted the film be longer to turn it into an epic and if anything Evans has done --- was make The Godfather into the one of the greatest films ever made. It is too bad we do not have Studio executives with the vision that Robert Evans had. Mario Puzos compelling narrative, Coppolas direction and the star making performances by the cast make The Godfather a film one should never miss.",positive
"""I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them as you can see. They talk when they should listen."" So good!",positive
"Just an awesome movie. The story, the actors - old school at its finest. Only flaw that the movie has some lengths in between.",positive
"After playing the game two years ago I wondered about how different the movie was from the game. And I've got to say they two have both become my favourite film of all time and my favourite game of all time. The movie has this half-noir, half-indie feeling. The art-direction is brilliant and the movie has never lost its power. But of course where the film succeeds is its cast. James Caan's potrayal of Sonny I would say exceeds Joe Pesci in Goodfellas and Al Pacino in Scarface. He is the classic example of a tough guy from the mob and his abuse of his authority ends up in one of the most brutal scenes in cinema history. Al Pacino is at the centre of the movie as Michael. He plays the son who once was dead against joining the family business but then we see him at the end of the movie becoming twice the man his father and late brother was, Don of the Family and New York City being his empire. Those were two great performances but its Marlon Brando who really steals the show. He is the wise and thoughtful mob chief. We hardly sse him for half the movie when he gets shot but in the moments where we do see him they are the most unforgettable mometns in movie history. I cant say anything about this movie that has not already been said so I can just say this is the most perplexing, stylish, awesome movie ever made by a human being.",positive
probably one of the best movies of all time.,positive
"It's the ultimate movie. Sheer perfection on every level. Nothing I can say about The Godfather will do any justice. It is to films what the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is to paintings. If I could watch one movie for the rest of my life, it would be The Godfather, no contest. It's as three-dimensional as films get. The performances and the story they drive are so real that it feels like it might as well be actual history taking place right before your eyes. I've never seen something simultaneously so emotionally complex, intellectually stimulating, and viscerally thrilling. The haunting story follows a good, law-abiding man (Pacino) who steps up to protect his criminal family in a time of crisis, and achieves victory at the cost of his humanity. The story makes you desire the power of the Corleone family while portraying it's devastating personal costs; it's never obvious about this message, and lets you as a viewer decide whether or not it's worth it. It's as touching and triumphant as it is violent and chilling. It's a gold-mine of dramatic irony, and you can take something new from it no matter how much you've seen it. The acting is unparalleled all across the board; the obvious Brando and Pacino aside, even the most minor characters come across as three-dimensional human beings who aren't just plot devices, but people with their own realistic dramas and believable motivations; the story wouldn't be complete without any of them. The film involves you more than you realize, and you can forget you're watching a movie; you feel the love (for the family), you feel the hate (for their enemies), and you even feel emotions you never knew you could feel (moral ambiguity has never been so morally ambiguous... don't even get me started). This movie is like a drug. It burns its way into your soul. If you've never seen The Godfather, see it. And even if you've seen it a hundred times, it's probably time to see it again.",positive
Masterclass by Brando - acting like this is just how it should be... A young Pacino n this film and he was brilliant too.,positive

"Great movie, one of the best movies ever made.",positive
"This is how you do it! What a superb adaptation! Everything in this movie is top notch! As the audience of The Godfather, we feel part of the family, part of a very private, very exclusive group. We see the Corleones in private moments, around dining tables et cetera, and so we feel we can relate to the characters, perhaps mostly to the character of Vito, as he attempts to guide his family, with any luck, into more law-abiding ventures. All performances can be labelled very good, with the exception of two. The first, worthy of particular note, is that of Marlon Brando. His presentation of Don Corleone is extremely well judged and nuanced. For instance, his marvellously understated patriarch tells us that here?s a man so powerful, that he no longer needs the bravado or arrogance displayed by other movie mob bosses. The other is that of Al Pacino. His is a skilful and wonderfully considered performance as Michael, the main character. At three hours long, it is what I would normally call a Bum-number, but it is so gripping and engaging that it makes you forget any deadness in your derriere. Beautifully shot, expertly directed and skilfully scripted, The Godfather stands head and shoulders above any other Mafia movie.",positive

The shot at the end where Michael lies to Kay and then just stays leaning up against the desk while she goes out to pour the drinks is so powerful. The acting is so top notch and the main characters feel so much like real people that I reached a point where I was completely sucked into the world of the film. Color was a bit funky. That 70's film stock wasn't the best, but the shot selection and the way it cut together was quite masterful. Win. [4 Stars] [090511]",positive

"Don't let the my Italian last name predict that this classic mob film would be on my favorite list. What a great film with incredible acting including giants Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan. There was a series made of these but the first remains my favorite.

THIS FILM IS THE GREATEST CRIME/MAFIA MOVIE THAT HAS EVER BEEN MADE. BRANDO SHOWED THAT HE WAS NOT WASHED UP AND SHOWED THAT HE STILL HAD GREAT PERFORMANCES IN HIM. THE BEST THING FOR THIS FILM THOUGH WAS THAT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WENT FROM THIS FILM TO BECOME BIGGER STARS THAN WHEN THEY WENT IN TO THAT MOVIE -AL PACINO -JAMES CAAN -JOHN CAZALE -DIANE KEATON DIRECTED BY FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA AS A MASTERPIECE,positive

"una joya del cine, pacino y brando se la comen!!!",positive
"Al Pacino makes one of the best breakthroughs in this role as Michael Corleone, son the Godfather. Robert Duvall leads a great supporting cast that includes Talia Shire and James Caan. But, the best performance(and it's a close tie with Al Pacino) is the man portraying the Godfather himself. The ""Father"" of the Corleone Family. Mr.Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. This performance would bring him his second Best Leading Actor Oscar(He would decline). This film would win 4 Academy Awards total, including Best Picture. Directed and Screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola. One of the best movies and a must see by anyone who enjoys a great story.",positive

"Perfection in the form of a movie. A wonderful pace, that is awesomely timeless. A very wonderful cast as well. Absolutely marvelous.",positive
"I've seen The Godfather at least twice before, but how could I pass up a chance to see the Coppola Restoration on the big screen? And, oh, do I ever not regret it. The film holds up as well as it ever has; it never sags for a second of its nearly three-hour run time, is flawlessly acted throughout, and builds to one of the most unforgettable climaxes of all time in the form of the baptism sequence. And the Restoration really is all I hoped it would be and more; the shadows are richer, the detail sharper, and the sound more spectacular and impactful (again, there's a moment in the baptism sequence that absolutely powerhouse in the new sound mix, and if you've seen the movie, you know what it is). A classic that deserves its place, The Godfather is less a celebration of the Mafia lifestyle and more a bleak, grim film about the way we all struggle against our own nature. From its perfect opening lines to that haunting final shot, it's a bona fide masterpiece. (And what does it say about Coppola that this is his weakest film from the 70s? What a streak.) Even more excited now about Part II next week.",positive

"Probably one of the best stories I've ever seen. Making a movie is one thing but making one that's 3 hours long is another. The Godfather succeeds masterfully. What Seven Samuraii and The Searchers were for the 50's, this movie is just that for the 70's. Even Lawrence of Arabia has me yawning at moments. I didn't feel that once during this entire movie. Bellissimo!",positive

"Corleone family and it's business. Suits and classy style. Italy and America mixed up. Men's rules where women has no power: ""Don't ask me about my business, Kay"". Lots of good actors: Marlon Brando is excellent Don Corleone (of course, no doubt) and Al Pacino has his charm already. Diane Keaton as Kay and Talia Shire (yes, from Rocky movies) as Connie and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. Theme music is a classic.",positive
"Even today, it resonates truth and loyalty. Family should always come first. This is one of my all time favorite movies.",positive
I don't really understand why it's called one of the best movies ever. It's way too long and I don't think that the book is one that is good for being a movie. Well it never got that boring so it's quite well done and back then it maybe was great with new stuff and so... But for me today there is not enough to make it very special (except of the lenght) Brando's performance is quite good too.,negative
this is the best film that has ever been created what a fantastic film,positive
"I can't believe that was al pacino. I never thought I would like this movie, and I actually really enjoyed it.....of course, I got just as much of a kick watching a young james caan and robert duvall.",positive

"Never before has the world witnessed such precision in terms of directing, acting, and screenplay. Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola delivered one of the finest, if not the greatest American movie ever made. Marlon Brando gives a performance that still to this day in 2008, has not been topped. This movie will stand the test of time, and be regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.",positive
"eh, i thought it was ok. i just couldnt get into it",negative

the best ever performance by brando and pacini,positive
truly in the top 10 greatest movies of all time. I love the godfather. The screen shots and camera angles are beautiful. It has to be one of the best movies for camera angles and different shots. Not to forget the actors in the movie are amazing. This movie hits the mark perfectly for a story that is complicated to make you think but simple enough that you do not have to really think a lot about what has just happened in the movie to understand it. To truly watch the godfather I believe that you should watch all three in a row.,positive
"I wouldn't mind seeing it, although it's on TV every other day.",positive
"It had been forever since I had watched this epic so I had to re-watch it. I don't think I was nearly old enough to appreciate it when I first saw it years ago. Great story, great characters, great performances all around.",positive

No review is necessary.,positive
"The Godfather is one of those very rare movies based on a book that manages to not only do the book complete justice, but also completely transcend into an institution of its own-there are more people who know of the movie than the book. The acting, the pacing, the mood, the violence, the loyalty, the cinematography, it's all perfect in this movie. The acting especially. Marlon Brando adds yet another iconic role to his list, and Al Pacino, a rookie actor at the time, managed to create one of his most-remembered roles right off the bat. Talia Shire, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton also deliver very powerful roles. The cinematography and film style are also to be remembered. Many directors have reused Coppola's film techniques, and the 1940's setting is completely flawless. Many of the scenes in this movie have been emulated thousands of times as well. I'm going to cut my review off here, because I could talk about this film for pages. But The Godfather is a stunning work of art. Easily one of the greatest films of all time. The only film I could say tops it in this style, and just barely, is The Godfather Part II, and I'm still baffled to this day how Coppola managed to go even further than his original film, because this is a damn hard film to follow up to.",positive
"The acting is brilliant allthrough. But the movie was too long, and I were bored at times.",negative
"Is it evil to romanticize the Mafia? Perhaps, but as family drama this is irresistible.",positive
"Good, of course . . .",positive
all time classical movie,positive
"The best movie ever made. Period. Extremely relevant and watchable to today, The Godfather is a masterpiece in filmmaking and is the unicorn that will never occur again.",positive
Just like wine: gets better every year.,positive
I'm ashamed that I have yet to see this film.,positive
"I first saw The Godfather when it was first shown on TV in the 70s (as the omnibus re-edit of the first 2 films, if memory serves). There was a great Coppola season on TV in 1985 in which they screened just about everything he'd done. I am nuts about Rumble Fish too.",positive
zeer mooie film aanrader voor de mensen die de huidige tekortkomingen van de filmindustrie beu zijn :p,positive
"Well, no doubts about the excellence of this movie, but I wouldn't say it's the greatest movie of all times. The story seems simple, but I got involved completely for 3 hrs.",positive
What more can I say? As great as Hollywood movies get.,positive
Best Movies of ALL TIME!!,positive
Everyone who played in this movie All Did AMAZING! From Start To Finish This was the beginning to all Mafioso Movies Out there!,positive

honestly it's rather too epic don't you think? i wish they would have had the precedent of sprawling movie franchises like harry potter to push them into making 5 tight movies instead of 3 very long and sometimes incoherent movies. i'm not saying i can't handle a three hour movie but to me this does feel like two flicks stuck together at times...,positive

greatest movie ever made,positive
"DONNY SAYS: From time to time, we have to watch great movies to compensate the lack of qualities in movies industry these days. Godfather (part 1) and sequels are the Capo de Capi.. From the maiden scene "" I love America, she made me a good fortune""..until the final scene when Michael Corleone became The Don, GodFather part1 hypnotises anyone who sees it, whether you are mafia-movie lover or not. In my humble opinion, Part 1 is the best of all three series.",positive
"Marlon Brando and Al Pachino did an amazing performance in the Godfather! The Godfather will be one of the best classic ever. He is the center of wisdom and knows what is right and wrong. ""he'll make you an offer that can't refuse.""",positive
Sonny Corleone epitomizes anger and impulsivity. very sexy and very dangerous.,positive
Can't call yourself a film lover if you haven't seen this!,positive
"So much has been spoken of The Godfather that for me to even review it is to be redundant. For those of you who have not experienced it, know this: The Godfather deserves every bit of respect it has recieved over the years and is easily one of (if not THE) greatest dramas and/or movies ever. Few are the occasions that so many talented actors and actresses are found in one film, perhaps the most significant of which being Marlon Brando. Though my favorite of his performances still goes to his work in Apocalypse Now, Brando's performance here will likely be the one he is most associated with in times to come. Its the responsibility of anyone interested in good cinema to see this movie, end of discussion.",positive
"I will not analyze such a legendary movie at this day and age anymore, but I must say that, once again an older movie sucked me in with its weird capability of being interesting, even when seemingly nothing happens. I had seen this movie before, of course. I would be a pretty pathetic movie fanatic if I hadn't. It was on tv this time and I was supposed to watch 5 minutes from the beginning. Three hours later I was still glued to my seat. That says something. I find myself being intrigued by good, decades-old movies. The pace is incredibly slow compared to almost any modern movie, they just sit and talk most of the time, but there is something mesmerizing in the whole affair. I cannot explain it, and I certainly don't agree that this is a perfect 5 star movie. It has its flaws. But damn, I watched it again, and I even own it on DVD too. And now I have to see the two sequels as well. Darn.",positive
I don't get bored of this classic!,positive
What more can be said...... A MAsterpiece,positive
"An absolute masterpiece. Quite possibly one of, if not THE greatest film of all time. can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather.""<br/><br/>If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.<br/><br/>The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.<br/><br/>The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their ""adopted"" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.<br/><br/>With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.<br/><br/>Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.<br/><br/>The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from ""innocent"" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.<br/><br/>Despite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable.<br/><br/>Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.<br/><br/>Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man"") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""throne"", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son).<br/><br/>The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it's surprising that Duvall wasn't passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn't flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan's Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can't be overlooked.<br/><br/>Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.<br/><br/>Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.<br/><br/>We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens.",positive
Fabulous movie...it seriously doesn't age...if its on TV I will stop what I'm doing and watch. A lot of great actors got their starts in this movie.,positive
"the greatest mob film ever to of come out during the 1970s. this is an epic tale about New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. starring Al Pacino, James Caan,John Cazale,Marlon Brando,Richard S. Castellano,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. The Godfather might well be the best mob film of all time. a masterpeice of a film from director Francis Ford Coppola.",positive
"I must've seen this movie before but couldn't remember it anymore. Mafia bosses son is being kept out the business and raised to be the good son but when his father gets shot he starts to plan some sort of a revenge and eventually becomes the new head of the family. I want to see how the story continues. It wasn't so cruel, brutal or violent movie like I would have thought but I guess the modern crime movies with drugdealers are more like that. This was about honor, respect and here they still had some kind of rules in illegal business but I guess it's different thesedays. Few years ago I really enjoyed the TV miniseries called The Last Don which is also written by the same person, Mario Puzo as this movie. I like the typical mafia humour for example the classic phrase ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"".",negative
Nothing I could say could do this movie justice except that it is a true classic.,positive
"Epic, heartbreaking, ultimately really long.",positive
"This is a must see movie for everyone, even if you have no interest in gangster movies or action or whatever. It's a foundation for so much of modern filmmaking and features great performances from a number of actors.",positive
should be required viewing.,positive
"The Godfather (1972) -- [9.0] -- ""The Godfather"" balances the private lives of its characters with their sensational 'occupation', and that's why I like it more than other 'tough-guy' movies. If I didn't care about the family members, no amount of horse beheadings or car explosions would be able to pick up the slack. Brando and Duvall command respect in their seemingly effortless performances, and Pacino provides all the empathy necessary to serve as our window into the shady underworld of the Corleone family. James Caan is also a stand-out as the hot-head brother. The story spans several years and a few continents, but it maintains a clean through-line: Michael Corleone's transformation from outsider to Dom. My favorite scenes were Pacino and Brando's, especially where Brando tells Pacino he never wanted this lifestyle for him. It's a father-and-son story that succeeds without any pointed dialogue or sentimentality. The movie builds their relationship very delicately, beginning with the opening wedding scene. Brando tells the photographer to delay the family photo because Michael hasn't arrived yet. For whatever reason, that was the moment I knew I would really like this movie.",positive
"There's not much to add to what has already been said about this movie. I bought the boxed set, watched them all and liked the original the best. Marlon Brando did a performance of a lifetime in this one.",positive

"Got to give credit where credit is due...although it's never been a personal favorite of mine, it's clearly a well-done film. The ensemble is perfect, the mood is great, and the story is expertly told...it moves a little slow in some sections tho. I prefer Goodfellas or Godfather 2.",positive
"What can I say, its just perfect, and along with part 2 they make up the best saga ever, The cast is a collection of some of the finest actors in history. I can watch The Godfather over and over.",positive
The absolute epitome of good movie making.I'm sorry but no one who has seen this movie could give this movie anything less then five stars. The cinematography and camera angles were not anything special but this movie doesn't rely on that but on brilliant writing and screenplay. Marlon Brando is the greatest actor ever to live and the Godfather proves that.,positive
"peerless classic! also,the background music is hilarious,breath takingly unforgettable! i love Marlon Brando! i love Godfather...",positive
"Everybody who has even a slight interest in film has heard of The Godfather. Even if you havenât seen it, no doubt you could quote or conjure up an image of what happens in the film. It is also no secret that The Godfather is internationally accepted as one of the best films ever, so what is the secret to its success, if it has one at all? The Godfather follows a Mafia family over the course of a decade in their business and family interests, showing the gradual decline of Vito âDonâ Corleone, and the shift of focus for his son, Michael, as well as numerous gang wars, betrayals and murders. The Godfather is epic in most senses of the word. Every scene feels extravagant and genuine in its setting at the same time. The balance between business and family for the Corleones is perfectly judged, which always keeps the plot gripping in each scene. Also, the cast is star-studded and excellent throughout, with not only many memorable faces like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall just to name a few, but there are many memorable scenes as well (the horsesâ head in the bed, Michael killing Solozzo and McCluskey in cold blood are just a couple of fine examples). This really is a work of art from Coppola. I have only one downer, and it is enough for me to prevent it from The Godfather getting maximum marks. I would have liked to have seen more of Marlon Brando especially in the second half of film, were, in my opinion, his character was criminally underused. The Godfather is deservedly one of cinemaâs most iconic and enduring films of the last 50 years. It touches everybody because, unbelievably for a film about the Mafia and their atrocities, Coppola focuses on family. As the highs and the many lows happen throughout the film, we watch upon the film as if we were a close relative, feeling the anguish and sadness with the Corleones. Which is why The Godfather shall always be popular with me, and many, many others present and future.",positive
One of the best movies ever...,positive
"the best out of the three. hail coppola,hail the corleone. ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""",positive
"Life, the universe and everything. Again, one of the first movies I was introduced to as a kid, pretty weird choice for the 'rents but it shaped me up good and tough. being exposed to a lot of fantastic films at a very tender age taught me to appreciate the beauty of the art form.",negative
"I'm not sure if I like this better or the sequel, but I think Brando and James Caan give this one the edge. Nothing much else I can say about this film that every other moviegoer or critic hasn't already said.",positive
"I can't really find any flaw save for the long running time, but other than that it was fantastic. Covers all the bases, and overall is a fascinating insight into the cruel cycle of violence that is the Mafia.",positive
"loved the young de niro & pacino, love the over-acting brando, love the cinematography, especially scenes from italy",negative
If you have not incorporated some of this phliosophy into your life. You are not yet a man. We all want to be the Godfather. Tradition. Family. Business. It is inspiring...,positive

"One of the best. The story, how it's directed and the acting is phenomenal, especially Brando as the Godfather.",positive
"didn't necessarily enjoy it too much - Got tedious and boring at times - storytelling is very conventional compared to today's standards - I can understand why this movie and its sequel is so significant. I think it glorifies the mafia rather than making it look bad. I enjoy the more stark, negative portrayals of the mafiia in other films. - I am fascinated by the character of Vito Corleone though. The portrayal of this character by Marlon Brando is and will remain legendary for a good while.",negative
QuÃ¨ lenta por dios...,positive
"one of the best films ever made, very true to mafia life!!",positive
"The book and movie are great for separate reasons. To not feel like a flick is dragging even after 2.5 hours is an accomplishment in and of itself. Great not because males harbor some love affair with organized crime,and not just because the acting is superb, but because every scene feels like it instantly becomes a classic to which all other great dramas must pay homage.",positive

"No matter how many times I watch it ... this movie never ceases to amaze me. The direction by Coppola, Puzo's original story and Pacino & Brando's acting ... they are all perfect. Definitely one of my most favorite movies of all time and undoubtedly the BEST mafia movie ... ever!",positive
"FINALLY saw this...and after thinking about it for a day, and all of the stuff that happened, all I have to say is.. Wow.",positive
It is the Godfather.,positive
This movie is real LEGEND,negative
The best of the Godfather movies.,positive
"The Godfather, now on blu-ray HD! What can I say but Wow! This is undoubtedly one of the greatest Mafia movies of all time. Brando and Pacino together deliver stellar performances with Al Pacino taking the lead from Brando as Michael Corleone, the son of the Godfather Corleone, who takes over the reigns of power from the aging don. Now beautifully restored on blu-ray HD with a fantastic 5.1 digital soundtrack. From the first few bars of the famous godfather theme music played during the opening scene, the sound is sharp, crisp and flawless. The color and shadows with the great attention to detail in the cars, clothes and interior designs also make this a great period piece besides being probably the most insightful and entertaining mafia movie ever. Rated by the American Film Institute as the # 3 greatest movie of the last 100 years, just behind citizen Caine and Casablanca. Not bad for a 1970's mobster movie!",positive
YOU BETTER SAY YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE....Unless you want a horse head in your bed.,negative
"Så! Nu har jag sett hela. Visst var den lång, men vilken upplevelse! Det är inte undra på att filmen hyllas som en av de bästa genom tiderna. Marlon Brando i en av sina mest ikoniska roller någonsin och en ung Al Pacino i högform kan bara bli bra helt enkelt. Storyn är välskriven, stämningen tät och dialogen bitvis trollbindande. Ser verkligen fram emot att kika på fortsättningen!",positive
"Difficult to say much about this... slow yet moves swiftly along, not much happens and yet packed with story... powerful but understated... Mostly great performances from the cast... a few redundant scenes but otherwise an almost perfect piece of cinema.",positive
"For a three hour movie, it kept my attention really well. Of course, I've never seen a Francis Ford Copolla movie under three hours, and I've never seen a Francis Ford Copolla movie that bored me, so I shouldn't have been surprised. Very solid movie.",positive
i love to spend a rainy day watching this movie,positive
"I can just hear Brando,""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" By far one of the greatest movies of all time.",positive
This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. I like how it tells the story of one family in a certain period of time organizing crime. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are excellent!,positive

This is the MOVIE of all time,positive
The first proper gangster film I ever saw.... then I was hooked!,positive
"Personally, I just loved the Italian 'flavor' in the movie. It reminded me of my growing up days....The acting was terrific, especially Michael's transformation from a college nerd to a respected head of the family. He created this illusion wonderfully, taking us along with him on this incredable journey. We felt his fears, his turmoil, his regrets. I loved it, and YES, it IS one of the best movies EVER!!!",positive
"All time great movie. A great gangstar, family, life movie.",positive
"""But Don, he doesn't me to play the part!"" ""I'll.. make him offer he can't refuse."" Cf (cross reference) my photo of a restaurant in Quito, Ecuador, where there was a poster of Vito Corleone and his famous quote ""I'll make him a pizza he can't refuse!""",positive
"A dark script, combined with moments of irony, haunting music, and strong performances, creates a film that is propelled above all else",positive
This one is a classic. Each and every line and performance memorable!,positive
A classic. This film is fabulous is in so many ways. My only complaint would be its length.,positive

"just a word.. ""wonderful..""",positive
"175 min, Not boring at all! I didn't realize it's Al Pacino who played the role of Michael! He looked so different! It is a role model of Gang/Gangster movies. It may not be new to all of us as we have watched these kinds of movies again and again. But when you consider it was produced 35 years ago, you wil appreciate it for sure. Btw, I don't understand the existance of Sicily girl, lol. I would cut that if I were the director. It would make the movie shorter n better for sure. Anyway, I did enjoy it much =D",positive
My Favorite Movie of Alltime.,positive
very nice movie... no wonder is ranked as one of the top movies ever made in history... but too much italian... cant understand a lot of part...,positive

"So many life lessons. ""Take the gun, leave the canoli. ""I'm gonna make 'em an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
"excellent movie! the performance, story, characters, photography. A classic",positive
"A despicable movie about despicable people. These ""Mob families"" are nothing more than adolescent gangs for grown-ups, fighting childishly over turf and power, the pinnacle of adult immaturity. Everyone in that movie disgusted me, especially Michael. His story is a tragic and very angering downfall from good respectable citizen to a cruel, heartless, gangster thug.",negative
"Finally.. I wonder why I had not seen this movie till now..!! But now that I have, I know what is all the fuss abut.. It is just simply BRILLIANT, OUTSTANDING and an AMAZING CINEMATIC EXPERINCE.!! Al Pachino, as always is a treat to watch.! LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT.!!",positive
"Brando is acting perfection in this. Pacino shows what's to come in the future with his acting. A great film that is long but really never feels like it. The third best ""gangster"" movie ever made.",positive
"Simply the greatest addition to popular culture ever. It is amazing where and how many Godfather references you find. Brando and Pacino each had better performances, but the combination of the two was much more than the sum of the parts.",positive
Nothing more can be said about this movie that hasn't been regurgitated a thousand times over. One of the greatest american movies ever! enough said.,positive

I enjoyed as much as I could understand, very educational in case I ever want to get into the 1940s mafia, but I've seen this film twice now and I still don't know who all of those people getting shot are, which is a shame cos it's a vital part of the plot.

"I just saw the restored version last night on a double-bill with ""Godfather II"" at the Ziegfeld (the most amazing movie theater in possibly the entire world, by the way). It was a pristine print, an enormous screen & maybe 15 people (even less for ""Part II"") in the theater. It was an ideal screening of this brilliant American epic. I mention this because this is one of the all-time greats. If you ever have an opportunity to see it in a theater on a large screen, do so. It's phenomenal. Especially, the richness of the cinematography. I know most people consider ""Part II"" to be superior, but I think I favor ""Part I"". I find Michael's slide into the family swamp more poignant. Also, there seems to be a simplicity to the first one. But I guess comparing the two is like asking me to choose between Haagen Daz & Krispy Kreme - they're both freaking awesome. And I'll eat them any chance I get.",positive

A richly-layered story, perfect acting, a beautiful score, and tireless directing by Coppola contribute to a film that never feels dated, and only improves with repeated viewings. Topped off by multiple unforgettable scenes and lines, very few films out there are as perfect as this one. Yes, perfect.",positive
The best movie ever made. Period. Number 1 on a short list of films that are absolutely perfect.,positive
"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.""",positive
"This is how you do it! What a superb adaptation! Everything in this movie is top notch! As the audience of The Godfather, we feel part of the family, part of a very private, very exclusive group. We see the Corleones in private moments, around dining tables et cetera, and so we feel we can relate to the characters, perhaps mostly to the character of Vito, as he attempts to guide his family, with any luck, into more law-abiding ventures. All performances can be labelled very good, with the exception of two. The first, worthy of particular note, is that of Marlon Brando. His presentation of Don Corleone is extremely well judged and nuanced. For instance, his marvellously understated patriarch tells us that here?s a man so powerful, that he no longer needs the bravado or arrogance displayed by other movie mob bosses. The other is that of Al Pacino. His is a skilful and wonderfully considered performance as Michael, the main character. At three hours long, it is what I would normally call a Bum-number, but it is so gripping and engaging that it makes you forget any deadness in your derriere. Beautifully shot, expertly directed and skilfully scripted, The Godfather stands head and shoulders above any other Mafia movie.",positive
"So I'll admit, I hadn't seen the Godfather in its entirety before (and whenever i saw parts of it, they always happened to be the parts set in Sicily, so I really didn't know it took place in the US). The cinematography was exceptional, the acting was great, the story (though not my thing) had parts that were touching, intense, and overall felt realistic. Definitely worth a viewing.",positive

"Holy crap, where do I start. Great acting, great story. Leave the gun, take the canollis",positive

why did I wait so long to see this? I usually hate this types of movies (mob/mafia/crime) but it's imdb rating was so high I had to see it ... and wow this was so well done and captivating! Lucky enough to see it in HD and will be watching the sequels soon!,positive

In one word : GREAT. Why did I wait so long to see it ?! And I had the chance to see it on big screen...,positive
"Part 1 & Part 2 to be watched back to back. Both parts reveal themselves with the same depth and imagination as one would read a book. Twists and turns, fulfilled expectaions and edge-of-the-seat scenes which surprise and sadden. Amazing film(s).",positive

"Film enthusiasts often consider The Godfather to be one of the greatest American made films of all time. This is not an exaggeration, and it is easily the best mafia film ever made. Everything about this movie screams perfection. From the passionate depiction of Italian/ mafia culture and life to the phenomenal performances from the cast, everything is fantastic.",positive
"Perhaps the best film ever made, if I were to judge objectively.",positive
I just saw the restored Coppola print at the Musicbox. I did not realize just how grainy the cinematography was. Enjoyed seeing it on the big screen.,positive
The best film ever made,positive
Coppola is simply brilliant!,positive
There is good reason why The Godfather won Best Picture! Too many top-billing star actors to listed; a walk-of-fame director; and an excellent story of life in the US of an Italian immigrant.,positive
sin palabras quien no le ponga 5 estrellas a esta pelicula no sabe de cine ni de nada!,positive
one of my favourite films. EVER! Al Pacino....what a hero,positive
"Excellent films, mainly because of the amazing actors in them, so believable.",positive
i cannot say anything but 'awesome'!!,positive
One of the best films ever made.,positive
"If not for its sequel, it would be hard to argue against ""The Godfather"" as the premiere achievement of the post-classical Hollywood cinema. Thirty six years later, this film is riveting from start to finish, and positively chilling when Michael returns from Italy and begins his ascent/descent (?) into power and total moral convenience. Brando is stunning in the scene just prior to his death, though the film's opening segment is more famous. And speaking of the opening segment, no film has more succinctly or elegantly established its raison d'etre than Coppola's does: a pitch black screen and the undertaker's words in voice-over--""I believe in America."" How did Coppola top this, while managing to also direct ""The Conversation"" in the same calendar year? Bar none, Coppola's run from '72-4 is the greatest three year directorial stretch in film history.",positive
What can you say it's a classic!,positive
The best film of all time. Truly a masterpiece that stands above all movies.,positive
My Favorite movie in the world,positive
always feel dirty after watching this one...,negative
"There really isn't much that hasn't been said about The Godfather, but I'm gonna say it all again. It is perfect in every single way. That's not like people saying The Dark Knight was perfect, because The Godfather is perfect, The Dark Knight was just overhyped and overrated. Before I saw this movie I read the novel by Mario Puzo. It's one of the only instances along with Forrest Gump where I would say the film is better. Its like the story was just better suited as to be a film, but this may just be because of Francis Ford Coppolla's genius direction. The fact that he never won an oscar for it is total crap, and I would like them to review the nominations now and then give an honest answer. The whole film just looks great. It's hard to explain, but the film just has a very rich, warm look to it. If I'm not mistaken the editors actually cut down all the blues and greens from the shots and bumped up the reds and yellows. It works terrific and makes the film look dark, without actually being dark. If you get the Coppolla Restoration editions it looks especially amazing in high-def, and it also improves the performances, which are incredible. To most people's surprise this film is not about Marlon Brando's character, despite all the posters and covers having him on it, him winning the best leading actor oscar, and it being named after his character. The film at it's core is an ensemble piece, but if you had to pick a main character it would definately be Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. His character is the one son of Brando's crime boss that doesn't want anything to do with the family business, despite clearly being the one his father wants to the most. He eventually becomes involved reluctantly and Pacino brilliantly makes it seem like he's a guy who does the most evil things, but hates himself for it. As I mentioned before because of the improved picture quality the performces, and it's the most noticeable with Pacino, because even when he's not saying anything he acts through his face, conveying to the audience what his character would be thinking about. It's brilliant, especially during the restaurant scene. It's easy to see why it was the scene that stopped them from firing him. Marlon Brando is good, but not as good as he's made out to be. He accurately plays the character of a dying king so to speak, but I think he's not that great. It's just a lot of mumbling and hand gestures, and I feel Robert DeNiro played him better in the sequel. James Caan plays Sonny Corleone, the next in line to be the don of the family. He's your stereotypical hothead, but he's great and anytime you see him get mad it's pure dynamite. Robert Duvall plays the adopted son Tom, also the families lawyer and the don's Consigliere. He's your typical thinker, who's down to earth thinking makes the glass always seem half empty. Like the others he's good, but not as fantastic as Al Pacino. The rest of the cast have pretty small parts, but there are a few noticeable performances by John Cazale, Diane Keaton & Richard Castellano. The dialogue is absolutely brilliant. It's intelligent and makes you feel like you're not dealing with your average street hoods. The cinematogaphy by Gordon Willis is also fantastic. It's classicly styled, and avoids the gritty style that most gangster movies try to do. It's like they want it to seem like a movie and not real life, which is perfect because as I mentioned as a film it excels beyond belief. The musical score is one most iconic in film history, and for good reasoning. It's memorable, can be epic and subtle, and is used brilliantly. A good example is the horse head scene where to different pieces play at once, it makes you dizzy and confused and works perfectly. It's also worth noting the great costume design. It all looks like authentic 40s and 50s clothing and just further makes you feel like you're there. The Godfather is easily one of the greatest films of all time. It's perfect beyond belief and everyone must see it, even if you don't like movies, because it will make you like them. It's that good!",positive
"[font=Impact][color=black]The godfather is a 1972 mafia drama directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The film is extremely complicated and will take the average person about 3-4 watches to understand the film. Acting is sub-par. Brando is decent, as is Duvall's. The acting really shines with Pacino & Caan. Over all is a good example of being promising but not done right. The Godfather part II easily gets a 8/10 but this one is not that great.[/color][/font]",negative

I shouldn't have to say much to recommend this.,positive
The classic tale of a family's struggle for power is told through the masterful direction of Francis Ford Coppola.,positive
"A masterpiece born from supreme talent. When planets align under the pressure of amoral studios and the real-life mob, persistent storytellers respond to that pressure and make the greatest of art. The amount of talent that collaborated in the completion of this work is unrivaled. These are the finest filmmakers, this is the finest film. The Godfather is perfect.",positive
"I only saw this for the first time yesterday and I was amazed at how intense the film is, backed up by acting performances from Pacino and Brando. Cant believe I waited so long but it was worth it. The pacing of the film is another big thing for me, its perfectly paced and it culminates to the end with some suspenseful kills. Need to see 2 & 3 but if they are half as good as this I wont mind.",positive
An amazing film and a very dangerous film to start watching. Once you start you can not stop and while extremely good It is 3 hours gone and heaven help you if it is a marathon and part 2 is next because then consider your day over.,positive
"An American epic. One hardly knows where to start. Marlon Brando turns in a great performance, and his is not even the best in the film. A memorable debut for Al Pacino. Incredible supporting performances from all involved, particularly Robert Duvall, John Cazale, and James Caan.",positive
i'll make you an offer you cant refuse. watch this film or else,positive

This is the greatest movie ever made. This is the first time I have actually watched the Godfather ever. I didn't know how good it was until I actually sat down and watched last night. When I was watching it I was thinking that the Don kinda looked like Hitler if he had Hitler's mustache. Anyway this is one of the oldest movie that I have seen so far. I really enjoyed it and that the 3 hours went by so fast I didn't know I was that long into it. It was really good and you could not really notice that Michael was Al Pacino until the credits. It was very long but is worth that amount of time to watch because it is the best movie that was ever made in my opinion for anyone that read this you would have to see it for yourself don't base your opinion on me.

"I was on my way to Gordo's one day with my friend, Cabbage, when we happened upon two fellows who seemed to be having a dispute, albeit somewhat one-sided. We were going to do our best to ignore them but one of the fellows stopped us and asked, ""Have you seen The Godfather?"" If you knew Cabbage you'd know that this is an absurd question to ask. When we replied ""Of course!"" in unison, the questioning man turned happily to his companion and and asked, ""See?!"" This solidified The Godfather as one of the greatest films of all time so far.",positive

This is filmaking at its best! One of the best movies ever made.,positive
"So I've heard about ""The Godfather"" forever and never got around to watch it. Now I can see what everyone was talking about. The movie is gripping from beginning to end. The scene with Michael in the restaurant with Sollozzo and McCluskey has to be one of the most intense scenes I've ever seen in any movie! Everyone's acting was phenomenal (especially Marlon Brando of course) , and the ending couldn't have been better. All in all, I may be late to the party, but this is definitely one of the best films of all time! It gets the highest ranking possible. 5 out of 5!",positive

"What can be said about the Godfather's excessive appeal? It is the ultimate film, the highest and most prestigious success that can be best summarized by its director Francis Ford Coppola: ""When someone makes a perfect wine or film they have done the impossible."" The Godfather is the film that broke that ominous barrier of perfection. The film is centered around the lives of the Corleone family, an Italian crime syndicate. The moment that 'The Godfather', Don Vito Corleone is introduced to the screen, the audience is fixated on the performance of Marlon Brando. He leads the cast stupendously, never faltering in his performance of a man who is victim to a new, changing and unstable New York City. The supporting cast out-do themselves, with young Al Pacino establishing himself for a fantastic future career. His performance as Michael Corleone, is astounding. The film not only centers on family dynamics, but also includes a chilling portrayal of the underground crime world, the world of 'gangsters'. From the infamous bed-invading horse head to the chilling murder of Sunny, The Godfather consists of scenes that linger hauntingly in its aftermath. Coppola masterfully creates a film that is awe-inspiring. The haunting soundtrack echoes throughout the film, setting the backdrop for a beautiful Sicilian village or placing us in the lap of a feud-ridden New York City. Nino Rota's score is breath-taking and no doubt stands amongst the greatest film soundtracks of all time. The Godfather is an amazing tale ultimately focusing on the themes of family love, but also shows us, through Michael Corleone, and the unnerving christening scene, that absolute power corrupts absolutely.",positive
The greatest film of all time. There i said it. Without a doubt set the bar for which all other films are compared artistically.,positive
One of the best mafia movies of all times.,positive
The only thing that bothered me was Al Pacino's wife... why doesn't she get it?,positive
Marlon Brando was amazing. I also loved watching Pacino's character evolve,positive

"This past week or so was very productive in terms of watching movies and such. In my American Film class, as a part of our study of cinematography, we watched Spike Lee's [b]Malcolm X[/b], which was much better and much less obviously pretentious than his obnoxious [b]Do The Right Thing[/b]. The film, starring Denzel Washington in a tour-de-force performance that is engaging, brilliant, and passionate, is a long bio-pic of the African American figure of the 50s and 60s. There are some Spike Lee moments, but it's good to see Lee just tell a good old narrative. Also good that he didn't cast himself as X (although he is one of the principal supporting roles). It's a solid film. On Friday night, I went to my friend Ben's house and watched [b]The Godfather[/b] from the beginning to end for the first time (I had seen about 50% of the movie). Needless to say, it's a brilliant film. Coppola is a brilliant director and it's such a visually, thematically, and emotionally engaging and deep work of art. No crap from me on this one. Now that I think about it, there isn't anything wrong with it. It's... well, perfect. [u][b]10/10[/b][/u] THEN on Sunday night (I didn't have school on Monday), I went over to my friend's house and watched two really awesome movies. The first of which was [b]The Big Lebowski[/b], which reminded me a LOT of [b]Burn After Reading[/b], another film by the Coen Brothers. It's a very random, bizarre tale of someone getting dragged into something much bigger and muddled than himself. Jeff Bridges stars as The Dude and he is just hysterical. Really funny. John Goodman, Julianne Moore (SO FUNNY), and Philip Seymour Hoffman are all excellent in their supporting roles. Awesome flick. [u][b]9/10[/b][/u] The second movie we watched (he was home-ridden because of a wisdom teeth removal) was [b]Pulp Fiction[/b], which I had seen the second half of. I must say, it's an electric, brilliant film. Tarantino steals alot from the French New Wave, but he has a lot of things that are original and you can just feel his passion and creativity running through every scene. His narrative style is creative and his writing is just great. Samuel L. Jackson is effing incredible as Jules. ""Does he look like a bitch?"" is my new favorite line. Just a great movie, obviously. [u][b]10/10[/b][/u] And I don't just dole 10/10s out, bitches.",positive

I like the first half but i felt it dragged on a bit too long,negative
"thoroughly boring for the first hour. definitely ends well but WAY over hyped. not one of the best movies of all time. I will say that I read the book first, which probably ruined my chances of liking this movie, as I was just sitting there thinking, ""alright already, lets get to the good stuff"" and it never comes...for a hour it just doesn't come.... it's still a great movie, but I won't put it on all time top ten lists any time soon. and what is with Brando's accent? it's terrible, I know it's classic, but it sucks, its annoying.",negative

"I can totally see why it was #3 in AFI's top 100 movie list of '98. The opening shot, probably one of the longest opening shots I've ever seen without a single cut, was shot so perfectly, I was captivated in the first minute. Little odds and ends I wasn't happy with, but I feel like another part of my life is fulfilled after watching this movie.",positive
"this movie gave birth to the gangster genre as we know it! this is one of those rare examples where the film outshines the book. the book was terrific and the author one of my favourite, but the actors really brought this tale to life. the characters have such a genuine air to them. the godfather is an outstanding film and definately worth a watch, but be warned it is addictive! in my opinion the two most riveting characters Pacino played are Michael corleone and tony montana and we all know this guy is one of the worlds finest actors. if you have not seen it get it this weekend and why not grab the sequals too? heck go for broke and grab scarface and enjoy the ride!!!",positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
OMG. THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME,positive
"It has greater scope than its successor, more betrayals and twists, and even better directing. Brando brings a commanding presence and compassionate character that leaves a noticeable gap in Part II. This is not to say Part II is not a great film by any means, but I saw Part II before Part I, and after seeing Part I, I have a greater appreciation for it. Beyond Brando's show-stealing performance, what makes Part I so good is the definable arc of Michael (played by a young Al Pacino). So when in the beginning we see Michael's determination to lead a straight and narrow life with a sweet Diane Keaton at his side, it becomes such a shock at the end when Michael's lie to his wife affirms him as the new Godfather. Violent, complex, and romantic, The Godfather is indeed an archetype for the American classic.",positive
One of the best films of all time. Nuff said.,positive
In a word: Magnificent!!!,positive
"Now i understand all the hype about this movie....i avoided watching it because i was not really a fan of mafia/mob movies but i was captivated from the first minute to the last, despite the fact that it was 2 hours and 55 minutes long...now i can't wait to watch the other godfather sequels...this movie is something you should not miss...",positive

"This is the best movie ever. Marlon Brando's performance surpassed every other performance he ever made, and it is a film to cherish and love. What makes me love this film so much is that mafia and gangster movies usually involve killing and violence. But this film is not like that. It's a film about family.",positive

"<i>The Godfather</i> es una de las películas más aclamadas de la historia del cine estadounidense; se trata de una adaptación de la novela del mismo nombre escrita por Mario Puzo. Considerada como una de las mejores cintas jamás filmadas, este drama sobre la mafia dirigido por Francis Ford Coppola representa una influencia mayor en el trabajo de un gran número de cineastas y una piedra angular para el séptimo arte. El filme narra la vejez del patriarca de la familia Corleone, una poderosa dinastía de la mafia siciliana en Nueva York. Después de rechazar una lucrativa propuesta de incursionar en el tráfico de drogas, Don Vito Corleone sufre un atentado a manos de hombres de una familia rival y sus hijos deben tomar control del negocio familiar mientras el Padrino se recupera de sus heridas. En primera instancia, Sonny, su hijo mayor, toma control del emporio criminal asesorado por su hermanastro Tom; consejero y abogado de Vito. Mientras tanto; Michael, hijo menor de Don Corleone, quien permanecía renuente a participar en los negocios de la familia, asesina a los atacantes de su padre y se refugia en Sicilia por órdenes de Sonny y de Tom, casándose con una muchacha y descubriendo las raíces de su familia. Las acciones de Michael en Nueva York provocan una sangrienta guerra entre las cinco principales familias criminales de la ciudad. Sonny muere al ser traicionado por el esposo de su hermana y, tras regresar a su casa, Vito organiza una reunión con los capos de las Cinco Familias; tras la cual previene a Michael, recién regresado de Italia tras la muerte de su esposa, de la posibilidad de un traidor dentro de la familia. Michael se casa entonces con Kay, quien fuera su novia antes de que él entrara al negocio familiar; y, pese a las primeras intenciones de su padre, lo sustituye como Don al retirarse éste. El nuevo patriarca de los Corleone decide mover a la familia a Nevada para adentrarse más al negocio de los casinos y, después de la muerte de su padre por un ataque al corazón, se encarga de mandar matar a los jefes de las Cinco Familias; con lo que posiciona a la familia Corleone como la organización criminal más poderosa del país. Más aún que retratar los negocios criminales de la Cosa Nostra,<i>The Godfather</i> nos presenta un drama familiar tan humano y profundo como alguna vez ha sido mostrado en pantalla. Todos los personajes que constituyen a la familia Corleone están cuidadosamente construidos en sus acciones y personalidad al rededor de motivaciones sensibles. Aunque el filme se plantea diversos problemas éticos, renuncia a tomar una posición moralista en torno a las situaciones presentadas. Es así que Coppola evita el enfoque tradicional del cine de crimen y mafia en que la maldad y la virtud se reducen a la pertenencia a alguno de los dos bandos disponibles para mostrarnos a la dinastía Corleone, interpretada por un elenco inmejorable, al modo en que el jefe de la familia protege a los suyos, a su clan y a sus tradiciones a través de la fuerza. La trama nos muestra a una cultura distinta, regida por valores tan inalterables como la lealtad y la responsabilidad, donde el fin del ser humano es ocupar su lugar en la familia y luchar para proteger a sus seres queridos; una cultura donde cada individuo termina haciendo simplemento lo que tiene que hacer para cuidar de los suyos, recurriendo a cualquier medio necesario para lograrlo. El mundo donde viven los Corleone es uno rodeado de corrupción y podredumbre, la sociedad es presentada como una estructura hipócrita y carente de bases morales, la Mafia representa un regreso a un mundo más sencillo pero´más honesto; uno que, entre su brutalidad y salvajismo, ofrece devolver al hombre los ritos y estructuras que sacrificó por la modernidad y el progreso. El estilo narrativo de la cinta se antoja teatral por su punto de vista externo que hace al espectador un testigo discreto de las acciones de los protagonistas. La estructura del guión es generalmente lineal y, aunque la acción está determinada por las situaciones presentadas, el desarrollo de personajes es determinante, remembrando también a las tragedias clásicas es este aspecto. El guión está construido detalladamente y consigue un equilibrio inusual entre el realismo y las licencias de estilo. El tono de la película es coherente durante el desenvolvimiento de la trama; mientras que el ritmo fluctúa de acuerdo a la naturaleza de la acción, sobreponiéndose a la extensa duración de la cinta por un trabajo de edición intachable. La dirección es igualmente ambiciosa y logra mantenerse a través de un uso extraordinario de los recursos cinematográficos y una conjunción de los lenguajes épico y dramático aplicada a los códigos del cine. La dirección de arte es uno de los puntos más fuertes de la cinta, con un estilo plenamente definido suficientemente estilizado para edificar una propuesta estética pero alejado de la hiperestilización y del culto a la imagen. La fotografía es excelente, oscura pero saturada y con una paleta de rojos y cafés; lo que aunado a un trabajo de cámara cuidadoso en todos los aspectos ofrece un apartado visual destacado. La música es, de igual modo, excelente y contribuye a establecer la, de por sí excelente, atmósfera de la película. Por su gran uso del lenguaje cinematográfico y su excelencia en todos los aspectos, <i>The Godfather</i> es considerada con justicia una de las mejores películas alguna vez creadas; una de las películas más influyentes de la historia y el cine de estudio estadounidense en su punto más alto. La obra de Coppola es un ejemplo abrumador de buen cine y un hito absoluto en la historia del arte cinematográfico. *****",positive
"Only the best movie ever. The storyline, the acting, the screenshots, the period's zeitgeist is captured accurately, everything in this movie is superior to any other movie I have ever seen.",positive
"Does anyone actually need me to review The Godfather? Seeing this film at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood was an offer I could not refuse (sorry). Anyway, it was a night of one classic scene after another with a slew a great performances. The Sopranos definitely borrowed liberally from this movie. I can't hardly wait for Part 2!",positive
Don't hate me but was bored,negative
Don't hate me but was bored,negative
"The Greatest Film. The best film by Coppola. The best crime film. The best film adapted from a novel. The Godfather is entertaining. You have great acting, characters with different personalities and charisma of their own: Sonny, Tom, Vito, and of course Michael. You have one great casting with amazing performances and sincerely, every minute of Godfather is worth to be called a classic. Some say it's boring and disappointing, I say they didn't get the movie when they watch it, but the more they watched the film, the more they went into the plot, the characters, the story, the whole atmosphere of the movie, and they finally understood the truth about The Godfather.",positive
"An epic family saga, a brilliant dissection of honour, shame and triumph, and one of the finest danged movies ever made. Brando's greatest mid-career screen role, and the movie that made Al Pacino AL PACINO.",positive
"Getting to see a frame-by-frame restored version of this film on the big screen was a real treat. The storytelling, the direction, and the acting are all first class. While Al Pacino has lately become a caricature of himself, his portrayal of Michael Corleone is a reminder of how effective a young, hungry, brilliant actor can be. James Caan is a real badass and Robert Duvall is wonderful as the voice of reason in the family. Full of truisms, complex familial relationships, suspenseful action sequences, and thoughful introspection, The Godfather is truly one of American Film's greatest treasures.",positive
"It's not necessarily my favorite movie (although it comes pretty close), but I know enough to tell you that it is possibly the greatest movie of all time.",positive
best gangster movie ever made,positive
"Another example of a fairly mediocre book being turned into a truly-awe-inspiring movie. This is less about the Mafia, than it is about all America, and by extension the entire Western world.This is arguably the single greatest moment of Marlon Brando's career, and if that's true of him, what of the many lesser actors that orbit Don Vito? James Caan is outstanding, while Pacino is way compelling as the reluctant heir, torn between American ways and the call of the old country.family, duty, honour, betrayal, revenge, and being on the cusp of two worlds.For this second generation kid, despite not being heir to a criminal empire, it's all too believable.",positive
This ISNT the best film ever made.,negative
"Amazing film. Marlon Brando's first decent film in years and years, and pretty much his last decent film all up.",positive
"A classic, need I say more?",positive
"all Very Good, Thanks.......",positive
"I love this movie, but I have to say it's overrated. Big pile on for it, everyone wants to say they love it, and I guess that makes me one of everyone. But the truth is, it's too long, it's too sepia, and it squanders Robert Duvall and James Caan.",negative
brilliant. Poor Marlon Brando. I wanted to see more of him.,positive
cult classic and the best,positive
"While I still prefer the Godfather II (from a structural and performance standpoint), it's got a slim advantage in the fact that Paramount basically let Coppola push things further after the success of the first one (he was often on the outs with the studio during the production and was nearly fired). I had forgotten it was Richard Conte (Mr. Brown from The Big Combo) who played the Corleone rival. Also, who can forget the classic line, ""I'M MOE GREEN! I MADE MY BONES WHEN YOU WERE GOING OUT WITH CHEERLEADERS"" that is nicely punctuated with a gunshot to the eyeball.",positive
"A cultural touchstone that lives up to its massive reputation with equally massive power. The themes are huge- loyalty, family ties, love, death- all the big ones. A minor gripe is that the plot is a little overshadowed by them, and is a little too convoluted, but this definitely earns the hype.",negative
"I'm not going to tell you why this movie is quite possibly the best movie ever, as the reasons are a matter of public record. What I will tell you is that its reputation is well-earned.",positive
This Will Always be a classic to remember this is one of those movies u could probably say perfect it does not struggle or fail and i think francis ford coppola was known as the best in the 70's for his movies he was unstopabble and this is is a movie that should never be missed ever,positive

Classic thats all I have to say :),positive
"*** This comment may contain spoilers *** The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.",positive
"Classic peformances, story, etc. Shaped a generation's opinions of what the mob looked and sounded like.",positive
"Nearly 40 years after its realese, ""The Godfather"" still stands today as one of the greatest films of all time. A movie that would become a standard for artistic quality among many films that followed. But of course none have ever really matched up to its greatness. Francis Ford Coppola takes us into the world of the New York crime family the Corleones and tells a story that not only revolves around crime, but family, honor, and respect. Although strong at times, this film has a lot of heart, and real drama. The acting is one of the films greatest elements. The legendary Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, aka ""The Godfather"", and his son Michael, portrayed by the legendary Al Pacino would take on the family bussiness and become the ultimate mafia don. The complete transformation of Pacino's character from the innocent college WWII solider, into the ruthless and dark mafia boss is perhaps one of the greatest character studies of all time. Pacino's performence is without doubt legendary. The strong performences by the other cast memebers include: James Caan, Robert DuVall, Dinae Keaton, and John Cazale. As far as the screenplay goes, well lets just say that it is the closest you will get to perfection. The dialog and character development and story line is just down right amazing. This movie truly is one of the greatets. If you call yourself a movie lover, and you haven't seen this incredible film, than you really haven't seen great filmmaking. This movie is as close to perfect as any movie will get.",positive
The absolute best movie ever made,positive
A masterpiece on so many levels.,positive
How do you review the greatest movie ever?,positive
"THE most amazing movie ever made in the history of this world.Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan are absolutely amazing! Their performances aren't to be missed. The rest of the cast also exceeds expectations. A must-watch!",positive
I luv watching it with my Cuz :),positive
my fav. movie eveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer its a legend in movie history,positive
"I finally saw it ans all I can think is ""meh"". It is just like every spoof and parody. I was pretty underwhelmed. You can tell that it's based on a novel because it just keeps going and going and going.",negative
"CLASSIC, one of the most amazing films ever made. So incredibly powerful and moving.",positive
"it's the stellar cast's career-best work that ultimately assures the viewer's interest even through the film's less-than-enthralling stretches. Not only the best of crime film, but all that is possible with cinematic achievement. One of those sublimely rare movies in which every elementâcasting, acting, directing, script, cinematography, scoreâcomes together.",positive
"Some day, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you you to do a service for me.",positive
"I thought the film was pure brilliant! Michael Coleone, what a character! A CLASSIC!",positive
"Forget that this movie has anything to do with the mafia for a second, and acknowledge that this is just one of the top two or three films of all time if you are having any qualms about seeing it.",positive
Perhaps the best mafia movie i've ever seen.,positive
This is a prime example of Francis Coppola's rare ability to maintain a perfect tone throughout a film. The Godfather is full of scenes you'll never forget.,positive
Undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made.,positive
"Genious, one of my favorite films of all time.",positive
"A great classic movie, great cast, the whole collection are must sees.",positive
"The godfather comes extremely close to portraying what most would call, a perfect film; but, in my humble opinion, I would not call it perfect. This though, is merely a personal perception. When movies get this good, classifying them as ""perfect"" or not is an opinion thing. Nonetheless, this is an incredible movie with perhaps, one of the best casts of any film. Despite being a little lengthy, I have rarely found myself looking at the time during the movie. Thank you FFC.",positive
Po meni najbolji film ikad snimljen i najbolja knjiga ikad napisana..,positive

Will be playing of TV's forever!,positive
such a brilliant movie.. a story about a New York Mafia set on 1940s. Great acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.. great cinematography.. I didn't even realized that it's 3 hours long as it dragged me along with the story.,positive
Never tell anyone outside the family what you're thinking... Hell yeah.,positive
AWESOME MOVIE SUCH A CLASSIC FILM=] ITS A MUST SEE U WONT REGERT IT=],positive
What can i say but Classic and horses head!!!,positive
Why did I wait so long to see this?,positive
"Classic. This movie is the very definition of the word classic. You're not a man until you've seen this film. Oscar-worthy of acting by the entire cast, of adapted screenplay, director, original score, makeup, set design, editing, sound, visual effects, and, of course, best picture. A",positive
Amazing movie along with scarface love it <3,positive
"I'll need to watch it again and again just to make sure I understand everything that happends, but I finally watched the whole thing and I just wonder why I hadn't done it sooner",positive
Great film. Work of art.,positive
"If you have never seen the Godfather, you're missing out on what may be the best film of all time.",positive
"Forget that these movies are slow and become engrossed in the fabulous music, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and the life of a Sicilian family completely enshrouded in the Mob and the prices that ensue. These films are great!",positive
"cinematic perfection...if you have never ever seen this beautiful film, FIX THE PROBLEM!",positive
"This American classic is in the top five best movies ever made. Everything about it is perfect: the look and feel (photography and art direction); the story (based on the excellent novel by Mario Puzo); the casting that made stars out of Duvall, Caan, and Pacino; the flawless direction and legendary dialogue. It's one of those movies that is impossible NOT to watch. Completely absorbing and thoroughly entertaining and always interesting. You've missed out if you've missed The Godfather.",positive
"Very Good, Long but kept my attention",positive
"All three movies are great (the third one is severely underrated). The best drama of all time, it transcends the typical crime/drama because at its heart it is a character study and an exploration of what family means. The first film flows the best, the second film has some truly great moments, and the third ends Michael's story gracefully and appropriately.",positive
"Hands down the best film ever made. No matter how many times I see it, I am always anxious to see what happens next.",positive
Best movie ever. The perfect tale of Crime.,positive
one of the greatest of all time,positive
This movie is just so well done.,positive
"all time favorite right here, every aspect of this movie is superb",positive
"Another great Brando film, and the best Gangster film of all time! Even though Brando is magnificent, I fall more into the performance of Pacino. Back when he didn't have to scream every piece of dialogue to get his point across. Coppola always gets the best performance out of his actors.",positive
greatest mafia movie i'd ever seen,positive
A család mindenek elott! :),positive
I don't know what it is in this film that makes it one of my favorites. It seems that you either love this or don't bother to watch till the end (so ratings never get bad since people who hasn't seen it shouldn't rate it).,positive
legendary movie...there cant be any movie above this,positive
Irrefutably a gem of the movie industry - the sound effects would put most modern action films to shame - not for the explosions but for the attention to detail - every noise is recorded and you are completely drawn into the film by that. This is by far the most detailed film I have ever watched; replicating such detail in a modern film is just too expensive (few exceptions aside). I feel it's also extremely important to rate a film in comparison to other films made at the time - you cannot compare movies from two different eras in the industry fairly - so watch a few others to have a good benchmark.,positive
best gangster films of all time,positive
How can you NOT like The Godfather?,positive
Meh. Lol just joking people.,positive
"overated, long tedious at times and boring. v gd acting in brandos account but its no way thr best film ever made",positive

I don't give 5's... which is the only reason I didn't rate this movie higher.,positive
The best movie ever made. I think this one line says it all. This is a masterpiece. Its like the Taj Mahal of the Film world. One of its kind.,positive
"""Lou Cabrozzi sleeps with the fishes""",positive
"Classic masterpiece. Gripping stuff, Brando and Pacino both radiate power like the sun. Didnt know if I would like this, as I dont really do Gangster movies, but this is an all-time gem.",positive

I gotta believe that this is the best movie ever.,positive
Greatest movie about the family business.,positive
To my mind the greatest acting performance of any actor in any movie. Brando just dominates the movie. Brilliantly written and acted. Can get a bit boring when you've seen it so many times. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. Later usurped by Apocalypse Now.,positive
Awesome movie one of the best ever made,positive
"One of the first and best gangster films. Brando is impeccable and the amount of memorable, parodied scenes is off the chart. Many will argue that successive mob films were superior (Goodfellas etc). While notable, none can match this for its ruthless subtlety. A timeless masterpiece.",positive
"the best best Mobster Gangster movie ever to of come out in the 1970s. The Godfather is based on the classic best selling novel by Mario Puzo. a epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. The Godfather stars Al Pacino,James Caan,John Cazale,Marlon Brando,Richard S. Castellano,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. i think this is the best out of the trilogy. a masterpiece of fillmaking from director Francis Ford Coppola. love the classic tagline:I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.",positive
Possibly the greatest movie ever made.,positive
What a movie... Never get tired of this story!,positive
If you ever think your stressed Watch this and think about his stress level. good film make sense all the way threw,negative
"The best gangster , the best movie in my life , ever .",positive
"i was really scared that vid not like this film but it was much better than i was going to give it credit for, sound is utilised beautifully in the film especially in one of Pacino's big character turning points. brando is right on especially in the hospital. the length became evident at some points but it always had an interseting story arc to tell. not the greatest film ever made but it was big",positive
I love Mafia Movies and this is the best ever in the world,positive

Es la que mas me gusta de las tres.,positive
"da movie dat put the rats to sleep,hottest movie still today,",positive
arguably the best of the 3. it was great to watch this again after many years since the first time around,positive
"I will try to spare all the cliche comments about this movie. First and foremost, read the book before watching the movie. Only then after doing that will you truly be able to love the film for what it is and more importantly, what it isnt.",positive
"Often cited as one of the greatest American films of all time, it's hard to find any fault with Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". As a gangster movie it's great, but as an examination of familial values and Italian-American culture it's a masterpiece. Coppola gives us literally dozens of instantly memorable scenes, including the horse's head in the bed and Michael's symbolic baptism in blood at the picture's climax. The cast is one of the most impressive ensembles ever assembled, featuring exemplary performances from Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, and Shire. Nino Rota's music is iconic, and DP Gordon Willis uses a rich visual palette to capture the period. The restored edition on DVD provides an exclusive commentary track from Coppola, which isn't as insightful to the film itself as it is to Coppola's filmmaking process, but is fascinating all the same.",positive
"Al Pacino e Diane Keaton Johnny quando era appena agli inizi aveva firmato un impegno di esclusiva con un famoso maestro. Dato che la sua carriera andava di bene in meglio, se ne voleva liberare. Chiese aiuto a mio padre, che Ã¨ suo padrino. Allora mio padre andÃ² a trovare quel maestro, e gli offrÃ¬ 10.000 dollari per sciogliere il contratto. La risposta fu no. Il giorno appresso, papÃ  andÃ² a trovarlo di nuovo, accompagnato da Luca Brasi. E questa volta quello firmÃ² la rinuncia, in cambio di un assegno di 100 dollari. E come si era convinto? PapÃ  gli aveva fatto unâofferta che non potÃ¨ rifiutare. Offerta in che senso? Luca gli puntÃ² una pistola alla testa. E mio padre disse che su quel documento ci sarebbe stata la sua firma oppure il suo cervello. Ã una storia vera.",positive
The finest film ever made.,positive
"The intersting thing about the film is, even though the family is running a crime organization we never see the effects of their underworld. No signs of the gambling and of the prostituition. For this we regard them as the heroes of the film and there are examples of even worse gangsters to prove this. In the end this is the great American gangster film that all others perspire to be. One of the great film masterpieces.",positive
"i actually prefer the second one, but this is still amazing",positive
It's just brilliant.,positive
"[font=Arial Narrow]Before I begin, let me jsut point out that, what can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? ""The greatest movie of all time,"" etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. If there is a soul who has seen this movie that did not enjoy it, or think it was a good story, I would be extremely surprised.[/font] [font=Arial Narrow]Premise: 1940s; the Corleone family are a Mafia crime syndicate, and are propositioned to get into the booming drugs trade. Once they resfuse, an attempt is made on Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando's) life. His hotheaded so, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) swears revenge, whilst good child Michael (Al Pacino in his breakthrough role) takes it upon himself to whack the enemies of his father. Michael eventually becomes the new Godfather in a series of brutal murders that brilliantly ends the film.[/font] [font=Arial Narrow]That synopsis is not even enough to sum up just how incredible and fantastic a movie this is. Everything about the movie is the stuff of Hollywood legend; Marlon Brando's unbelieveable portrayal of the proud Mafia patriarch, for which he won and subsequently refused, an Academy Award. The final scene which intercuts the Christening of Michael's nephew with the destruction of his enemies, Sonny getting blasted at the tollway, the dark shadowy world of the Don's office, his legendary hitman Luca Brasi, and of course, the shoot in Sicily, far removed from the American modernity, to a pre-war peasantry culture. [/font] [font=Arial Narrow]It has acheived a level of importance like no other film has. There is something about gangster films that seem to appeal to such a wide audience; Pulp Fiction and GoodFellas still make Top 100 lists of greatest films. But this film more than any other isn't about gangsters and crime; that is merely the backdrop. No, this film is about family and its values. The children will do anything for their father, whether it's capping a police officer and a drug dealer, or taking over his entire empire. Perhaps this is why, more than any other gangster film, or other film to be even more precise, that Francis Ford Coppola's [i]The Godfather [/i]can probably be called (and perhaps will for years to come) the greatest film of them all. [/font]",positive
"a masterpiece from every single angle and shot. The perfect example of how great filmmaking must be. Every line, every frame, every character, each performance, the lights , the colour, the cinematography, the editing. Everytingh fits in a most outstanding and heart moving film and the most epic mafia account until now",positive
Greatest Movie of all times. Period!,positive
"aaaaaaah the bes one, je ne me lasserais jamais de le voir et revoir ...",positive
What CAN I say?! Gotta love it!,positive
I have actually been to Sicily and what a beautiful country it is - I visited Corleone when I went - The film is fantastic and you hang on every word - A fantastic cast and proves what a fantastic director FFC is - Just get the box set - It's a must for everyone that appreciates film making and acting,positive
I'm just not a big fan.,negative
"This movie is simply fantastic. Period. I mean, what bad thing can you say about ""The Godfather""?",positive
"Supposedly one of the greatest movies of all time, yet what they don't tell you is that is fucking boring beyond all belief. Marlon Brando had me glued to the screen when he was ""doing business"" but other then that the plot and the characters had me yawning and checking my watch every 5 minutes. Convention wise, lighting, editing, cinematography this movie is absolutely beautiful.",negative
amazing :D al pacino is sooo young in this! horse head scene is LEGENDARY.,positive
What more can you say? It's the Godfather.,positive
"I hadn't realised the influence that this film has had on the world I live in and the world I see in the cinema and on video/dvd. Al Pacino was truly awesome, whilst the feeling of family that is built up at the beginning of the film has to be seen to be believed.",positive
"The most gloriously depicted film of all time, both visually and musically. A thrilling story with an excellent cast from one of the most talented directors in the indusrty.",positive
"To my mind, as perfect a piece of cinema as you're ever likely to see - on every level. It has been my all time favourite since I saw it in '72 and I don't think it dates in over 30 years of repeated viewing. Timeless!",positive
best movie ever i've seen..,positive
I made him an offer he couldn't refuse,positive
one of the greatest movies of all time,positive
Such a well-crafted classical film!,positive

It really started really slow for me but then i really got in to it !!!,positive
"This was GOOD, i can't wait to se the other 2",positive
Still one of the best!,positive
Marlon Brando is a genius in the film,positive
ITALIANS R THE BEST,positive
A classic...almost a moral obligation to quote at least once day,positive
"Yes 4.5 stars for this and 5 for Hellboy 2 (for all 2 of you that tell me you read my reviews). Now don't get me wrong, while I gave Hellboy 2 a higher rating than the Godfather I have to say it is not near as good a movie. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. ""So why the 4.5 stars Zach? Why not give it the perfect 5/5?"" Two reasons, 5/5 does not mean a movie is perfect, it means the movie experience was perfect. I watched the film and it exceeded all expectations. I can't say that was true for the Godfather. 19 years of waiting and while I definately enjoyed the cinematic experience, it didn't have quite the sting I thought it would. Still great, gonna watch part II today.",positive
"every time i watch it, it amazes me. its like a drug that u want to go bak 2 over and over. there is no surpassing it, no bettering it. like fight club, it just has a great scene then another great scene, then another etc. and the great scenes keep on coming till the end. simply perfect. GREATEST FILM EVER MADE",positive
"The Godfather is as much part of the DNA of American Culture as Jazz, Blues, Rock n' Roll and Hip-Hop. It is American Cinema realized, made within the studio system, it is as much a real Indie Film before we had a definition. Directed by a Francis Ford that fully understands, realizes and therefore realizes one of if not the best films ever made.",positive
"I take it back, The Godfather is not overrated, it deserves its classic status.",positive
"an absolute remarkable movie worth a watch atleast once (if not more),a treat for a person who loves these kinds of ""gangster"" movies.. Marlon Brando with his impressive acting truly completse the role of the god father..loved every bit of the movie",positive
"The classic that inspired so many movies. Acting, Screenplay, Music & Direction all top class. Easy to see why so many consider it to be the greatest movie ever made. Very impressive",positive
http://filmreviewsnsuch.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-godfather-trilogy.html,positive
"its the reveloution of the film industary ,its so hard to say somthing or analize something this powerfull and big ,incredeble performences from all of the actors and that great music its beautifull,and a lot moreeeeeeeeee",positive
...Hanno sparato a tuo padre per questioni d'affari! Non personali Sonny...,positive
I want to see it on the big screen. The cinematography looks amazing!,positive
"Don't take me wrong, I always like Al Pacino, but I think Marlon Brando is better acting the best Godfather! My first American Gangster movie too!",positive
Marlon Brando is amazing sooooo good movie,positive
this movie just absolutely set the tone for gangster movies. brilliant.,positive
"Brilliant masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino far more than just great actors. This film perfectly delievers great entertainment throughout. I understand that the start can be ""boring"" but some of the best scenes come from the very first scene of the movie.",positive
Nothing to say that hasn't been said about this movie. Simply one of the greatest,positive
"Brando is brilliant, and I believe this is one of Pacino's greatest performances, if for nothing else than that he manages to go 3 hours without ranting. Probably the best gangster movie ever made, largely because of Brando's iconic performance. This film has been parodied countless times, and with good reason.",positive
"outstanding,mindblowing,superhit...i wanna see it every single day",positive
"Gooood movie, nunca la habia visto!!! es buenisima!!!!",positive
"Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever.",positive
One of the best movies ever!!!,positive
"One of my favorite movies of all time, a classic gagster movie, and one that I consider the greatest movie ever made. I love Marlon Brando's Don Carleone and the suspence is top notch. This movie makes me want to join/start a mob family.",positive
BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIMES,positive
"Why haven't I reviewed this before? Dunno! Well here goes: watch The Godfather when you've 3 hours spare, have some friends around, feel like becoming engrossed in a movie, and want to see how a great movie should be. Why not 5*??? If you watch The Godfather today, it DOES drag a bit. Ok, so if there was a 4.99* rating, I would've given it that, but there isn't. And I truly think they could have cut about 20 minutes out without ruining the feel. So it's NOT a 5*/5* - sorry....now I've time to watch part II!!! Yippee!",positive
"What an unbelievably great movie this is. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton, and Cazale are all fantastic - it's an acting tour-de-force. So many great lines to quote. So many scenes have become iconic. My favorite scene is when Michael orders the hits on the other families while he's at church becoming godfather. I actually love all three Godfather pictures and did not really think that Sofia Coppola has as bad as the critics say. The one who was really missed from III was Duvall. George Hamilton tried but he's no Duvall.",positive
Best film ever... no. Amazing however. Did not enjoy it until Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) got shot after that I was gripped.,positive
Second only to Godfather II.,positive
My 2nd favorite movie of all time.,positive
I love and have the Box set...It is the Don of Mafia Movies.,positive
"Too much talking, not enough action ;-)",negative
"Such a brillent film. A lot of depth is created in this film to set up the second one. And if you are not going to watch it properly then don't even bother. The plot is very thick but in the end sets up everything so beautifully. Marlon Brando is excellent as Vito Corleone and such a respectable man. Sonny played by James Caan is a massive highlight of this film and a bad ass that we all just love. ( Garbage can scene) Then enter Michael Corleone (Al ""don't fuck with me"" Pacino) And right there is your masterpeice of film. As we watch Michael Transfer into the New Don Corleone and take over the family business",positive
the greatest mafia film ever made,positive
An Awesome Mix Of Actors,positive
"One of the best movies ever... great characters, great script, great music, pretty much great everything",positive
"Right up there with ""Citizen Kane.""",positive
awe-strukingly mind blowing!,positive
"A must see movie. Marlon Brando, Duvall and Pacino together, you can`t ask more",positive
The beginning of Coppola's masterwork trilogy!!!,positive
Home of the Moe Green special; His eyes got too big for his stomach.,positive
This Film Is Just Amazing,positive
"love the movie as well as the others and the game even tho i made a 29 on it which sucks but maybe i'll do better on the others lol. but, the last question on the 652 were taken for godfather makes no sense. its michaels daughter not son! duh!",positive
one of my favorite movies!,positive
"Amazing, a largely dialogue driven movie that never got old. Almost 3 hours of sheer brilliance. It's so over-rated and I hate that some people inevitably like this movie because ""everyone else does"". But I truly enjoyed every second. I said it once I'll say it again, James Caan is crazy awesome, Sonny was one of my favorite characters.",positive
"What can i say, simply superb",positive
One of the best movies ever made,positive
welll i think everyone knows what this movie. is ranked number one on alot of best movie liists in my top 2 along with pulp fiction. the corleone family and there business are not willing to sell drugs and this starts a war with other gangsters. brandos second best performance as vito corleone won him his second oscar th rest of the cast is very good as well . espescially duvall . a must see if you like films and havent seen this movie there is something wrong with you,positive
"A cinematic masterpiece that defines its specific genre more than any movie ever has. Brando, Caan and Duval all give top notch turns. And pacino just blows the house away. Francis fords American crime epic is as good as it gets no other film in this genre has ever matched the power and been able to weave such a huge amount of plots into one story so well. the story is one of a man who loved his father but never wanted to be him and a father who wished for something more for his son. But ended up becoming much worse than his father ever was. I can go on forever talking about why this movie is so good, the endless themes and plots. But its just best to see it for yourself. Its just amazingly Powerful!",positive
"Well I finally did it,I saw the first Godfather YAY,about dam time I know.My hubby is sure happy.Anyway I guess I can officially call myself and American and a Moviegoer lol.This was really good,kind of hard for me to keep everyone staright and man it was long but very very good.Parts 2 and 3 are on tap for this week so I will be getting reviews out on those soon as well.Anyway I am sure I am the last idiot on earth to see this,but just in case I am not,You need to see this lol.Don't wait as long as I did =)",positive
"what an awesome movie... from a good boy to THE Godfather... for the family, or is it for power... The new Godfather's stone cold lying reminds me you, you're Michael while I'm Kay... you lie without blinking while i believe every word you say...",positive
"All times hit movie. After watching this movie i got a great urge to be a DON:) I watched this movie few years back and could not stop myself to watch all three parts, although the third one is not up to the mark as the first two were.",positive
"As others have said, the only movie better than this is The Godfather II. The acting, storyline, everything engrosses you. You want to be there like this is real life, even though there is good and bad taking place. It offers several cardinal rules for business and personal life. 1) Never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking (Vito Corleone) 2) It's business, nothing personal.",positive
A learning into the history of a Big and influential italian american family,positive
"There is only one movie better than this one and thats Godfather 2. The story is deep and will take more than one viewing to truly understand all of the relationships in this masterpiece. I enjoy and discover new elements of drama and movie making each time I watch. One note about this series of films, avoid Godfather 3 at all cost, it has no value and was a mistake that I hope someday will be corrected.",positive
"""que parezca un accidente""",positive
"Agreed with everyone else, this is the best movie of all time - a masterpiece.",positive
The Godfather trilogy are the best mafia films of all time. I only wish Brando was in all 3 as hes superb.,positive
The all time classic which is still watchable and still has power over the audience. Say no more,positive
My favorite movie of all time!,positive
This is a must see! Even if it's just so you'll understand the thousands of references made about the movie.,positive
Increible pelicula...unas de las mejores..,positive
"Greatest. Movie. Ever. Brando, Pachino, Caan, and Duvall were brilliant.",positive
"Gold, no other Mafia movie can top this. They just don't make movies like this anymore.",positive
"Pfff, please. It's the Godfather. Everybody knows.",positive
La familia es la familia... Me encantan las pelÃ­culas relacionadas con la mafia y esta pelÃ­cula es su mÃ¡ximo exponente. El personaje de Don Vito es mÃ­tico.,positive
all godfathers are great,positive
"Hate 70s cinema, hate mobster mvoies, but this is a classic for a reason.",positive
"Una excelente pelicula... lo Ãºnico que tiene es que esta bastante, bastante larga!!! tenia tiempo sin verla, pero buenisima!",positive
Godfather wants an airfield.,positive
the father of all the good movies,positive
Everything lived up to the hype. Except where the one guy is beating up the other guy and it is the fakest kicking and punching I've ever seen.,positive
"Of all the movies, this one ranks number 3 behind godfather 2, and scarface. This story is amazing, compelling, and has plenty of amazing actors. this one will go down as one of the best movies in the history of film.",positive
A film that is universally accepted as the best film ever made... I don't really see any point for me to explain why I loved it.,positive
"""For justice, we must go to Don Corleone."" This is an amazing movie with a gripping plot line, an amazingly well-chosen cast, and countless classic scenes and moments. I highly recommend that you see it if you haven't, you'll love it.",positive
"While watching this movie, I came to understand why it's had such an impact. The cast are fantastic (especially Brandon and Pacino), the story has everything (love, corruption, action, vengeance, drama, and even sprinkles of humor) but it never feels pretentious or forced for even a second, and despite the considerable length (almost 3 hours), the time just seems to fly by because something happens in literally every scene of the movie. If you haven't seen it yet, then go see it.",positive
"Its a pretty great drama movie. Wonderful cast and plot, lovely cinematography too :)",positive
"This was sooooooooooo long! But it was awesome, so I understand why it's a classic. You can tell it definitely paved the way for The Sopranos....",positive
who doesnt like this film?,positive
"This is one of the greatest movies of all time, Francis Ford Coppola creates a master piece with this classic mafia tale. It has a combination of beautiful dialogue, amazing acting, and magnificently executed deaths that allows the movie to flow gorgeously",positive
My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse..see this movies,positive
Am I the only person who thinks part 1 is better then part 2? maybe a bit overrated but a really good movie.,positive
"great film, and a ground-breaking one. i expected it to blow me away more because it is so famous and so many people call it one of the greatest movies of all. incredible cast.",negative
"Just fantastic. The themes, the acting and the music were all so moving. I loved the way it established a real sense of family among the gangsters - you could really believe and understand the kind of loyalty that would lead you straight into the jaws of what could possibly be a painful grim and violent death. The passion was all there and very believable. The emotions were so engulfing and the characters all compelling - despite their deeds. Loved it!",positive
Best Movie Ever!!!!!,positive
Another of my all time favorites! I just love me some Al Pacino!,positive
"La soluciÃ³n a cualquier problema de la vida se encuentra en el padrino (creo que lo dijo el personaje de Tom Hanks en la pelicula ""you've got email""",positive

Brilliant....I just love it.,positive
"the number one film of all time. citizen kane was not that good. this film has it all.everyone in this movie was perfect. a great saga about family, love and vengence, power and corruption. it has it all.",positive
Great movie about the Sicilian Mafia!,positive
It follows the book great! and with the all-star cast it has. i mean wow! it is by far either number one or number two all time on my list.,positive
"Perhaps my favorite film of all time. I have seen many movies but none of them have appealed to me as much as this one. Looking back on the movie today, there is no way you could have had a better cast. All the main actors will go down in history as the the greatest for their time. Pacino gives a brilliant performance leading into the next two films. Caan is great as ill-tempered Sonny. And of course, we all know the character that Mr. Brando made famous, Don Corleone. Definitely one that can be watched over and over again.",positive
"If you don't like this movie, you have no soul.",positive
Finally saw this movie from beginning to end for the first time...and I was pleasantly surprised.,positive
"what a fantastic movie well made, well-acted and directed smoothly this is the one that set the bar for all filmmaking it's also important to keep in mind that this movie is considered by all critics, ""the Greatest Film Ever""",positive
"In spite of the violence, foul language, and the brief sex scene, this movie tells a story in a very engrossing way. The characters all stand out in their own way. Very memorable movie",positive
Al Pacino and Marlon Brando awesome combination must see movie not just cos of its a mafia but the acting is superb and the storyline just awesome,positive
another trilogy that i could just watch at anytime.,positive
As far as I'm concerned one of the best movies ever.,positive
My opinion - the second greatest movie of all time. only Citizen Kane tops it. What a movie!,positive
"If no one made Shawshank, this would be my favorite of all time.",positive
"The shift in Michael Corleone's position in the activies of the family still eludes me but other than that, it's a great classic.",positive
Perhaps the best film ever in its genre.,positive
The GODFATHER What more can i say,positive
these are all great films,positive
best movie of all time ;),positive
Are ya kidding me? If this movie is not in your top 3...you're a moron.,positive
"Transcends the generations, remaining every bit as powerful today, 36 years later. Unusual, in this era of the quick pop instant gratification, that a textbook in storytelling can retain it's aura.",positive

Masterpiece ....Enough said!,positive

Mestariteos ja todellinen klassikko. Muuta ei tarvitse edes sanoa :),positive
"The Godfather is a testament to how beautiful and revealing a movie can be for human nature. The intense and rivoting plot carried the underlying evil that humanity suffers from. Michael Corleone, brilliantly portrayed through the spectacular Al Pacino, is every man who ever wanted better for himself, who ever had a dream, or a wish, or loved, yet was human and could not ease himself out of the rut of humanity. Marlon Brando's Don Corleone, or Vito, was an emotionally stable, yet effective character, through him we felt such powerful emotions, and experiances. Beautiful jobs by both the stunning actors. James Caan's Sonny, Talia Shire's Connie, and Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen were all fantastic additions not only to the plot, but to the acting and style of the film. Francis Ford Coppola spent every shot, every angle, and every cut adding either a symbolic message, or a visual message to the story or the characters themselves. It was such a perfect job that you really need to view the movie twice to understand the intensity of it. The written story itself was also an amazing addition to movie history. The plot flows brilliantly and allows a character arc, and development for each character. Every moment, and every line has a greater purpose in the grand scheme of the film and has both literal and symbolic meanings that are apparent during the run of the film. A beautiful, and exquisite masterpiece of human nature, and perfection in the production department as a whole. A MUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSST SEE.",positive
"The acting, directing, and script of this film are all amazing. This is one of the greatest movies ever made.",positive
"Much ado about nothing. Boring, violent for no reason, extremely long. On the other hand, we have some faultless performances and the great score of Nino Rota that will always cling to your mind.",negative
"One of the greatest movies of all time, I always half expect to wake up in the morning with a horse's head laying at my feet...",positive
It is a classic ok! But is it really so profound and groundbreaking?,negative
Very impressive acting,positive
La perfezione fatta film. 5 stelle sono persino poche!,positive
"considered by many to be the best mob movie ever they obviously haven't seen Goodfellas. Nevertheless, still a well crafted masterpiece",positive
"what a movie, must see!!!!!",positive
I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse,positive
By far the best of the three beautifully filmed with good story line 2 is also good three is where it really goes downhill,positive
"The dramatic masterpiece. So well done. Fantastic acting, particularly from Pacino and Brando. Beautiful cinematography and great plot twists.",positive
Look what they did to my Santino...,positive
"A truly epic story about family,How Pacino didn't get an Oscar is anyone's guess. <br/>Watching Michael change as the movie progress is the very heart of the movie. One of my all time favorites.",positive
"Timeless classic. Not in personal top 10 faves, but an absolute must see for any movie lover.",positive
"a classic, my favorite mafia movie",positive
"This is the film by which all standards are set as far as I'm concerned. Its a Perfect Film about family, with all the elements of a film about family: betrayal, revenge, love and devotion.",positive
One of the best movie I've ever seen!.....Marlon Brando......Al Pacino....were superb!...hats off!,positive
"Actually not my favorite Godfather (that title goes to Part 2), but an absolutely brilliant film. Changed cinema forever",positive
it makes me wish to be italian.-,positive
"Without question the king of all mob movies. Brilliant performances from Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton. Coppola provides us a glimpse into a Crime Family's life. We are drawn into their plotting, their revenge and eventual demise. But it also has a romantic quality to it with sweeping musical themes and pace. Favorite scenes include the beginning with Bonasera plea to the Godfather for revenge. The restaurant scene with Michael killing the men who attemped murder on the Don. Any of the Sicily scenes. The final revenge against the heads of the five families as Michael is becoming godfather to his nephew.",positive
A true classic... the acting was terrific and the plot amazing... It potrays organized crime not in a sinister scope but a close knit family.. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino carried the story almost to perfection. A must see,positive
A classic for a reason.,positive
"es un clasico!! marlon brando y al pacino soberbios. los cambios de papeles, el cambio de mando entre padre e hijo, el concepto de familia, la cultura.. la mafia de la vieja escuela.. la primera de todo lo que vino despues.. imperdible",positive
A flim that every man (and I mean every man) must see at least once in his lifetime,positive
The best film ever made.,positive
I and II are easily two of the top ten movies of all time.,positive
Oh MY Word... one of the greatest movies EVER made.... sublime.... incredible...,positive
one of the best if not the best ... marlon brando and al pacino such strong performances ... AWESOME,positive
Perfect movie one of tha best all time.,positive
the godfather is just about the only mafia movie i've seen that i've actually liked. maybe that's due to its superior cinematography and acting and music and pretty much everything else.,positive
"The Godfather films are considered some of the best films ever, so when you see it, you really are expecting something. Basically, overhype. If you watch one film having heard nothing of it, then your expectations are equal, you rate the film on your own experience. However, if you watch said film reading it is one of the best films ever, you really raise the bar without realizing that the people who said it was really good thought it this way because they saw it with their own opinion. Almost no film can pass that bar so highly raised, which led to the creation of the word: ""overrated"". However, the Godfather doesn't only pass the bar, it jumps over it and being on the other side, destroys it, leading to the creation of your own bar. Although Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando are hailed as the stars of the film, the real protagonist is Al Pacino, and the trilogy, more than the show of the power of the Corleone family, is about the rise and fall, the process from that brave, honored soldier in love to that old man that tried to seek redemption a long time ago and failed, losing friends, family and love. The universal question related to this films is: ""Which one's better: Part I or Part II?"" And I don't know the answer, both are equally good. My complaint to that question, however, is the exclusion of Part III. It is universally accepted that Part III is the weaker of the trilogy, and while I don't say that its better than Part I or Part II, it is a damn good film. The complaints normally go to Sofia Coppola's acting and Michael's death scene. Defending each, Sofia Coppola isn't good, but it isn't bad either, it doesn't really bring or take anything from the picture. And Michael's death scene, in my opinion, is one of the best scenes in the movie, going from dances with Michael, with people and music symbolizing the company that Michael had to Michael sitting alone, no music, no dialogue, representing how far have his sins taken him.",positive
All you need to know in life is in this movie.,positive
ohhhh yeslike this 1.'you mess with me u mess with my family'.,positive

"The entire gamut of viewers from jaded, seasoned critics (both official and self-proclaimed) to cinematic hacks (like myself) will enjoy this movie.

"Most people will agree that this is the best gangster movie ever made, and I agree. Brando, Pacino, Caan and Duvall all did a wonderful job and made us believe that the character's are real.",positive
The Greatest Movie ever made - End of ! Titanic - 10 oscars you must be joking!,positive
too boooooooooooring!!!,negative
It is the original and it's the first movie of an amazing trilogy. Can't watch the second godfather without watching the first.,positive
Marlon Brando you are a legend.,negative
Classic and perfect!,positive
Mind Blowing!! Simply Awesome!!!,positive
"""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
"I think one word can sum this up - Awesome. Yeah, it's a long movie. But it's by no means long and boring. You need to watch every bit otherwise you'll get mighty confused by the end. In fact, you might even need to watch it twice to really understand what happened.",positive
A classic!! There are no words. I love it!!!,positive
GF 1 and 2 were cut together into one chronological sequence and then shown on TV...good new way to watch these classics,positive
"Simply amazing. The acting, direction, and script are nearly perfect.",positive
do i need to say more?,positive
"If there is anything I can do for you, you come, we talk...",positive
"I'm enjoy watching for three hours...full of thrilling, dramatic & tragedy of wiseguy family",positive
"There's a reason it's known to be ""the perfect movie"".",positive
"really good movie. some of the effects [fake blood and punches and stuff] made me giggle. but overall, it waz really good. i really liked that it wazn't like overly dramatic or anything.",positive
The best film ever made without doubt,positive
"LA MEJOR DE LA HISTORIA,, LEJOS",positive
total classic. masterpiece.,positive
"An amazing movie that draws you in like no other, making you care for the members of the Mafia despite how despicable they can be. Has inspired so many movies since its release. Love the soundtrack, particularly the ominous violin melody",positive
"Greatest movie of all time, BAR NONE!!",positive
you haevn't seen a real film until you've seen this,positive
"For some reason I had never held the Godfather in the regards it deserved. I've always loved the film, and thought it was one of the greatest ever made. However, I had never had a true passion for it until I rewatched it about a month ago (probably the 10th time I had seen it). It's a beautiful film, and nearly every performance shines with a certain brilliance. The influence this film has had cannot be overrated. It's a shame Coppola may never make something so beautiful and incendiary again.",positive
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.,positive
The hopes of a father for his son come crushing down under the reality of life,positive
classic american film,positive
I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse,positive
"Not just this one, but the whole trilogy. The american dream has never tasted so bitter",positive
"I have seen the Godfather probably 10 times and it never gets old, but yet I do not have it in my top 10. The reason why is because there just wasn't room for me to be like everyone else. Don't get me wrong, great movie, incredible acting just have to be me. See the movie though with part 2 and skip 3.",positive
"A masterpiece. The story of Michael's attempt at escaping his destiny, only to be trapped back into family affairs, is one of the most compelling tragedies I've seen on film.",positive
the Godfather was was very well directed by F F Coppola and took a couple of yrs to film one of my favorites,positive
My favorite movie of all time!!,positive
"slow pace but good storyline and does'ent get boring , a must see if your into mafia movies",positive
excellente adaptation du roman,positive
The greatest American movie ever made. A story of family and the mob that is expertly made in every respect.,positive
Greatest film ever made.,positive
la mejor prlicula que he visto ultimamente..........TREMENDA!,positive
"I know it has been said over and over....and over again, but this movie IS a masterpiece. Though it feels a little long at times, it is a film that needs to be seen by all who can take it.",positive
"Epic epic movie! It really put an interesting perspective to the mafia life in America in the 1940s. The pace is slow and really lets you soak in the detail. The relationship and hierarchy between all the mobsters is very well made. I'm extremely impressed on how good Francis Ford Coppola got is all into this movie. Normally I'm not fond of long movies, but in this case I'll make an exception, just to enjoy this masterpiece of a well made and well played movie. I would very much recommend this movie to any person who might have an interest in the mafia world, life in America in the 1940s or just people who enjoy an really good movie.",positive
a slow start and a slow pace. the film is not very exciting but is well written and acted and sets for the scene for the follow up which is the best of the trilogy,negative
"Beautifully paced, masterfully directed and featuring some of the greatest performances of all time.",positive
One of if not the greatest movie of all time.,positive
"Still, the best movie ever!",positive
probably my favorite movie of all time.,positive
"This is a classic. It has an all-star cast, and you soon forget that it's nearly 3 hours long.",positive
This is the greatest movie ever made totally blows away citizen kane,positive
First Viewing: Hey...who am I to badmouth the godfather?...but it wasn't that good...and there was way too many characters to keep count on...don't get me wrong...it was good...but great?...I don't know<br/><br/>Second Viewing: Okay I'm sorry. Now I get it. You got to pay attention...It's not like todays movies where you get to know everything you have to at the begining. It's a well telled story that don't mean shit if you don't know who the people involved are. The first time I saw it...I remembered seeing Robert Duvall one time. And Sonnys death. Sure it was good action...But who was he...No one knows. This time...I understod The Godfather. And Marlon Brando did not deserve the crap I gave him while rating L.A. Confidential.<br/><br/>...Al Pachino was good too,positive
"I always hear that Godfather II is better than the Godfather. I saw both last night for the third or fourth time, and I think they are both extraordinary movies. Everytime I see these films I come at them with eyes tired of however many more years of Hollywood cinema than I had the last time. And every time I see them, I am astounded at how brilliant they are. In every way, they are great works of art. The lighting in The Godfather is one of its highlights, with the darkness eclipsing the wedding scene as Brando does his deals with the regular customers while Connie celebrates outside. And the sculpting and crafting of the lighting never stops, right up until Fredo is ordered killed on the lake at the Nevada homestead at the end of the second film. The performances are also among the best performances of some of these actors. Pacino goes without saying - the aging across all three films, not just in years, but in his ability to negotiate, to deal with the world around him and the criminals he is orchestrating, is written all over every aspect of his face. And this is a face whose gestures are so nuanced but articulated with absolute clarity that we have no doubt as to what is going through his mind. Brando too is wonderful - who can forget that voice. It's fabulous. A young Diane Keaton becomes more and more like the Diane Keaton we all know and love across the course of the two films, and Robert Duvall is so superbly cast as Tom Hagen. I had forgotten how politically involved the films were - they are so contemporary to their moment, both as it is represented in the story, and that of the films' productions. The post-World War II economic boom, Watergate America, the involvement in Cuba, the rise of the drug cartells and on it goes. There's not enough space to recommend these two films to the extent that they should be recommended. Fabulous",positive
"Way to long. I got very, very bored with the movie after Al Pacino took over. I really hope the Godfather Part II is much more interesting.",negative
"I watch this movie to see a great Marlon Brando movie and I get a great Al Pacino movie. I mean...yes Pacino is fantastic and Brando is iconic, but be forewarned: The star of this movie is Al Pacino. That being said, a great mob movie with intense action a great arching plot that covers all the rises and falls of the evolving world of organized crime. A little slow, but if you're prepared its well worth it.",positive
So overrated. Part II is better.,positive
Some of the greatest scenes in film history are in this movie. It is a great adaptation of the novel. The ending is worth it all.,positive
This is the type of movie that gets better with each viewing. Things are picked out that you missed the previous time you watched it.,positive
Simply the best film ever made.,positive
loved all thm marlan brondo is great,positive
The Greatest movie ever made.,positive
This movie stands the test of time as the greatest movie ever made and proves that Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are 2 of the greatest actors of all time,positive
"i know i'm in the minority on this, but the godfather just doesn't do it for me. i did not like 1 or 2 and i'm not even going to bother watching 3. i gave it 3 stars because the acting was very good but other than that the movie doesn't cut it for me. i found it boring and painfully long.",negative
la mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos,positive
2nd Greatest Gangster Film Ever Lol,positive
"If Marlon Brando hadn't won the Oscar for Best Actor, I wouldn't be who I am today...",positive
Great film! Superb acting and part 2 is just as great!!!,positive
"S'ha de mirar agenollat mentre es resa un pare nostre, o un fadrí nostre...ja ja ja xD",positive
"My favourite movie...the of I,II,III",positive
how sweet young Al pacino is in this film...,positive
the best!!!brando r.i.p.,positive
Marlon Brando is one of the most genious actors of all-time... one of his best movies!,positive
"The closest a film has ever come to being perfect. There is only one small minute mistake that I noticed, but regardless, it definitely deserves the title as Greatest American Film.",positive
"This keeps getting better, even after the 25th viewing.",positive
Cinematic perfection.,positive
Sweet film. Just watched. 10/10. Highly recommended,positive
"Once I finally saw it, I completely understood what everyone was trying to tell me. 100% the best mafia movie I've ever seen.",positive
Brilliant all around.,positive
"A piece of genius! This is without a doubt the most iconic movie ever made and the performances by Brabdo, Pacino, Caan, Duvall, and even Keaton show the pure brilliance of the film!",positive
"For those that haven't done so read the book before seeing the film for the first time. Could possibly be the greatest American film ever made. Superbly casted, I defy even the most critical of viewers to find a movie with a cast to rival this one. Brando, outstanding. Pacino, riveting (his best work was still the 2nd in this series). Caan, unforgetable. Duvall the consumate professional. Quotes are legendary, a film about fathers and sons just as much as a detailed, elaborate crime story.",positive
"not quite my fav movie, but I def think this is the greatest movie ever made",positive
"its highly overrated, thats all i'm saying.",negative
"""Leave The Gun, Take The Cannoli"" In My Opinion This Is The Film That Raised The Bar For Films Today It Truly Is Wonderful",positive
Simply put film as god intended it Brando carries the film and yet with Pacino Caan and Duvall the film does not rely upon just Brandos incredible performance it is spectacular,positive
"Good, but not as great as I had heard. Maybe someone should enlighten me as to why I should love it, and perhaps I could be swayed.",negative
Brando is un dios pagano,positive
"The best movie of all time! It was the begining of all mob movies... other greats that followed.... scarface, goodfellows, the untouchables, casino.... just to name a few",positive
"Really, what more can you say about this movie?",positive
"The ultimate movie, not to say the GOAT. A piece of genius.",positive
2nd best of all time......,positive
only bested by Part II,positive
"Un clasico del genero de mafia que se tiene que ver por obligacion, guste o no. La historia va mas alla de la violencia y los asesinatos del crimen organizado. THE GODFATHER es proyecta como la cultura, la familia y la tradicion trabaja estrategicamente como un poder extraoficial.",positive
Films just don't get any better than this. Period. A masterpiece. that has some of the most brilliant acting in it. LOVE IT!,positive
"One of the most famous and classic American movies. Almost every scene is a classic. All the acting is brilliant, one of the best casts ever. Love the music too.",positive

"The Godfather tells the tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. <div style=""width:800px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com/servlet/embed/photo/link/9847371""><img src=""http://www.flixster.com/servlet/embed/photo/9847371.jpg"" border=""0""/></a><div style=""text-align:center;font-size:10px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com"">Flixster</a> - Share Movies</div></div> in this classic gangster film you have Al Pacino, James Caan, Marlon Brando and also Robert Duvall. Francis Ford Coppola makes the best gangster movie ever made.",positive
What can be said that hasn't already been said. It still sucks you in & holds you in it's grasp.,positive
The best Mobs movie ever made,positive
"""That's my family, Kay. Not me."" Yeah Right!",positive
Need anything be said?!?,positive
"Favorite movie series of all time. Im 20 years old and already seen it over 100 times, all 3 of em.",positive
Wat can I say? One of Coppola's greatest piece of art and Al was so very young... Marlon Brando lives like a REAL godfather... Great Pic!,positive
"Not many movies I call a true masterpiece. When I saw the Godfather I thought that it would be impossible to match the brilliance of that movie. To this day, no movie has betten it. It is my number 1 movie of all time, and trust me thats a hard thing to get because I am an extremely tough critic.",positive
"I'm Italian, 'nough said.",positive
In the Pantheon - a quote for all occasions!!,positive
It's simply a classic.,positive

tis tha best movie fullstop,positive
"I don't care too much for this movie, but its a classic, and has great characters.",negative
Great movie. best quotes go to Clemenza.,positive
"I've revised my opinion on this film. At first, the violence and foul language offended me. Now I've realized it's actually not condoning this, but rather condemning it in an extremely artistic way. A caveat: this movie does NOT stand on its own. To understand it you must watch Part II. Fantastic movie overall.",positive
i coulda been a contendor.,positive
A vital first film in one of the greatest triologys to grace the silver screen.,positive
THE EPIC for the ages,positive
"Great, great movie. The dialogue and atmosphere reeks of honesty. Truly mesmerizing.",positive
"This film should be in everyones top 10. Everything comes together to make a film that is going to last 100 life times. This is why people go to see movies. Almost flawless, rent, buy or steal.",positive
WOW. This is film making.,positive
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE,positive
"Besides Finding Nemo and Wall-E this is my favorite film of all time. Just captivating the way it was shot, directed, acted, and brought across on the big screen. In all honestly this film never dies for me and I could continue to watch it over and over again. Definitely the staging point for all gangster/mob films that soon followed.",positive
A Masterpiece. When I first saw it I was about 10 years old and my eyes were glued to the screen. I have a copy of the DVD and still love it!! The making of Pacino!!,positive
Very interesting movie portraying the mafia,positive
"I know it's a classic and all but it's never done much for me. Love the book, though.",negative
Un ClÃ¡sico. La mejor historia de mafia de todos los tiempos. Es de las pocas pelÃ­culas que no se deja opacar por el libro.,positive
"i read a book-i liked it, then i watched a movie-i liked it as well))",positive
"Classic. I first read the novel twice (I loved it) some years ago then watched the movie recently. It's brilliant, more than I imagined when I read the book. The scene where Michael is standing godfather to his sister's kid and then his orders of killing people are carried out is just brilliant.",positive
"I know that this ratng is very harsh, i just wasn't entertained by the film. It was very boring. I was tired at the time so thats probably why i found it boring.",negative
A true American epic. One of the greatest movies ever made.,positive
Fantastic films all of them,positive
"An epic film that shows the great reach of the acting talents of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and the rest of the cast, as well as Francis Ford Coppola's abilities as a storyteller.",positive
"as Don Vito Corleone would say.. "" I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
one of the best movies fantastic i can watch it over and over again,positive
"I think the first movie from the trilogy is arguably the best. Many says that is overrated, but I think this movie really dwells with the story about family. I don't think this is necessary as a mafia/mob/organized crime movie, but more about a family. About how a good person has to defend the family honor's and becomes an evil person. A great casting and storylines, when I watched it, my heart always beats faster because the movie is very good.",positive
"The Godfather is one of the best stories ever told on film, and, although i feel part 2 is a fraction better, I do not mean to undermine this piece of filmmaking. Coppola directs this with grace and power, and the performancea of Pacino, Brando and Duvall are a testiment to this.",positive
2nd greatest movie ever.,positive
its The Godfather?!!,positive
The birth of bro-quotes. But this film is a great example of structured story-telling.,positive
Classic. One of my all time favorite movies.,positive
Historys greatest triumph,positive
The second best movie ever made,positive
"kind of a masterpiece, i'll agree",positive
"Generally regarding as the best movie ever, this movie is a gem with a superb cast, great story, and outstanding acting. The movie portraits the Corleone family and it's rise, fall, and return to glory. This and its sequel are what are great about cinema---a movie you can watch and lose yourself in---one of the best!",positive
quite simplt the finest film ever made.,positive
Its one of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
esta va por Alberto :-),positive

I truly don't understand why everyone says this is the best movie ever.,negative
BEST MOVIE EVERR!!!!!!,positive
Is it the greatest movie of all time? I submit that is just may be!,positive

Best comprehensive Italian Mafia story of all time. And I don't think it will ever be beaten.,positive
"Everybody has to love this movie. Al, Marlon and James did an amazing job. Greatest movie of all time.",positive
"A slow moving picture that may take a while to get into, but very engaging. Even though this may be one of the best crime saga movies ever, it is certainly not the greatest movie ever made.",positive
this movie is all good,positive
A very very good movie.,positive
Make me an offer I can't refuse.,positive
"A masterpiece , can be watched over & over",positive
"Amazing film , superb acting & a great story line. This movie set the standard for all future gangster films ! For those who are wondering it only gets a 4 1/2 cos the Godfather part 2 is even better !!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive
"The Standard. I mean really, what can I write that hasn't already been said. It's just an amazing movie and it has stood up to the test of time.",positive
"Don Corleone: ""Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? """,positive
Es necesario un comentario ? Es el Padrino !!! Si la has visto mas de 20 veces es porque es buena...,positive
Mi pelÃ­cula favorita de la vida! Realmente la actuaciÃ³n de Marlon Brando es indescriptible... No me canso de verla jamÃ¡s. Imperdible...,positive
how can you not love this?,positive
"EXCELLENT film! Wonderful acting, musical scores, plot, good action. One of the best films to come out of the 1970s. Marlon Brando kicked ass!",positive
What more can I say?,positive
pfft...doubters can see themselves out,positive
the best movie ever made...,positive
"Oh such a thrilling start! Everything is charming bout the godfather ""Marlon Brando"" specifically ;)",positive

I'm sure the book was better.,negative
"One of the best movies ever. This movie got everything. Great acting, setting, atmosphere, action and story",positive
"Marlon Brando, and Al Pacino in the same movie. It doesn't get any better than that. A true classic. Perfect.",positive
i just didn't like this movie.,negative
"Eh... I ge the point that an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind, but this movie didn't really do its duty to turn my heart against vengeance. I was moved with sympathy for the sister when she was getting beaten, but she was portrayed as so neurotic that it was impossible to care that her asshole of a husband died at the end. I just thought it was kind of cold. But... wow, Al Pacino! I can hardly recognize him!",negative
if you havent seen this movie you should die,positive
An awesome classic! A must see if you haven't yet!,positive
"Un peliculon de todos los tiempos, para sentarse tranqui con un gancia a verla",positive
simply outstanding....,positive
"Al, c'est d'la balle !!! Humpf ok heu... non mais sÃ©rieusement, je n'ai mÃªme pas envie de commenter ce film : aucune critique constructive Ã  en faire qui n'aie dÃ©jÃ  Ã©tÃ© faite. Je dirai juste, comme un kung-fu panda perdu en Italie : topissimo ! J'ai hÃ¢te de voir le 2 et le 3 pour savourer encore plus l'imitation du pote de Tony dans les Soprano : ""Just when I thought I was out...... they pull me back in"".",positive
"One of...if not the Greatest movie ever. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan what a cast, story, music, audacity..and the sequel The Godfather II another epic..I first saw this movie in the theater in Spanish with Italian subtitles...yeah i'm that old!",positive
It was showing on telly again. How can I resist?,positive
Is there any better movie???,positive
This is the best movie... EVER!,positive
This is the movie that started it all. If you like gangster movies than this is the Mona Lisa. Al Pacino kicks ass!,positive
Great movie. Still have no clue what the hell Brando is saying...,positive
"Touted as one of the best movies ever made, and for good reason. Not something you can watch any time, but it has some of the most epic scenes ever recorded. F. Ford Coppola at his best.",positive
the best movie ever made. if you are impatient and have a small attention span do not watch this movie,positive
Excellent movie! I loved it!,positive
The greatest of mob movies,positive
The definitive gangster movie from which all others are born,positive
Amazing film. Can't decide between Parts 1 & 2 for best. Part 3 is not bad despite Sofia Coppola's 'acting',positive
this is the best movie ever made no joke.,positive
"Without doubt, the finest movie ever made.",positive
"claim as the best movie ever made, of course it have got it reason. the narrivation, cinematogrph, acting (oh Brando once again, he is just immortal). with all the mix positive aspects. makes the movie historcal and cultual signicicant.",positive
definately top 10 greatest movies ever made,positive
Has to be the BEST movie of all time!!,positive
DON CORLEONE:Do you spend time with your family? Good. Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.,positive
I'll Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse.,positive
Breathtaking. Unbelieveable that Godfather Part II was equally good.,positive
"OMG! This was a helluva movie. I was bowled over by this film. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino & Robert Duvaal were jus flawlwss. The movie showed what real power was. It was a superb piece of cinema,,,no wonder why the world considers it the the best movie ever made.",positive
"Quite possibly the best film ever made, truely amazing story line.",positive
greatest movie ever period,positive
"Proud to be half Italian! Lol, this film needs no intro, and if you haven't seen it...you probably have a terrible taste in film. Just kidding. I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse: Watch this now. No other mafia movie has come close to topping it.",positive
this is exelent but after the all the ppl who made this keept making part 2 and 3 its just started to loose its value,positive
por que no la mejor de todos los tiempos? vito corleone es de esos personajes que no se borran y constituyen una institucion por si solos ademas tiene un pedazo de elenco mejor guion y coppola no siendo mi director favorito lo hace excelente,positive
"This is a the best story about crime there is. This is one of those movies wich you couldn't change any of the actors in, every one plays their part to the fullest. Marlon Brando has created a memorable character, and most of the prais should go to him and Coppoloa. Withous coppoloa would we just get something that would probaly only be remembered for 2 or 3 years. This movie is just a legend we will never see again.",positive
"There is nothing to say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said; Coppola's dark, brooding mafia epic is very possibly the greatest film ever made.",positive
"It's The Godfather. All the characters are explored, all the details are well done, and it builds an idealistic young character into the dark and grimly realistic new head of a powerful family. A cornerstone of American Cinema and a masterwork.",positive
classic...power....sarkaar,positive
My favourite.... The best-est movie ever made,positive
"I really don't get the deal with these movies. I feel like Peter from Family Guy (anyone? anyone? remember that when they're about to drown and they're talking about the movie?) Anyway, boring movie. Don't get it. I'll just say what Peter's response was, which I agree with....I loved the Money Pit.",negative
lo mejor del cine hasta hoy,positive
I was ready for this to let me down cos i'd taken so long to see it...but my god it is perfect. Absolute must see for anyone!!,positive
"Probably the best movie of all time, an I am not kidding, if you haven't seen this, go out and rent it now, and the sequel.",positive
Marlyn Brando BRAVO :),positive

"if this movie is not in your top 50, and your a man - it means your gay.",positive
The ultimate mob movie!,positive
Magistraal! Krijgt net geen vijf sterren... die zijn voorbestemd voor Godfather 2.,positive
"I really would have liked this movie more if someone besides Al Pacino had played Michael Corleone. I just did not like him, I couldn't care for his character at all. Everyone else was stellar, a fantastic story. I don't know if I would commit the 3 hours to watch it again any time soon but its worth seeing this classic movie.",positive

I know the dialog by heart. :),positive
"The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza. Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart. Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone. The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for. Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings. Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory. His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her. An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.",positive
"this was a really good movie to watch i liked it but the second one was really good but i liked the frist one more and i saw the third one and it was not that good they should had stop after 2 because it was good and so was the frist one but the third one was not even good it sucked only the 1st one and the 2nd one were good but if you have not seen it this is what its about The story begins as ""Don"" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia ""family"", oversees his daughter's wedding. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and ""family"". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don's fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the family and then Vito Corleone is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart <div style=""width:832px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com/actor/al-pacino/photos?p=3618285""><img src=""http://content7.flixster.com/photo/36/18/28/3618285_gal.jpg"" border=""0""/></a><div style=""text-align:center;font-size:10px;""> Michael: You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

"it wasnt until i watched this movie the second time i realized how darn good this movie really was. i remember watching it the first time as a kid i didnt really understand why they were killing each other .. then i came to realize the drug trade and power struggle was the reason for the violence and ultimately the rise of michael corleone. group of world class actors made this movie an instant classic. also considering the movie was made in 1972 you have to be awed in the level of the production. ive watched this movie from the beginning several times ,and each time it tends to get better because i tend understand story better. however, i do not recommend this movie to minors because of its strong violence.",positive

Brilliantly made and acted, with a strong storyline that keeps you hooked despite the films' length, and it leaves you demanding more.

Here is a present you simply can not refuse.,positive
"There is little that can be said about The Godfather that hasn't already been said about the film. Despite it's high praise, this movie does, in fact, have flaws just like everything else in this world does. However, while it does have flaws, all of them are pratically invisible even with it's intimidating length. The flaws are brilliantly covered up by its cast who deliver their lines wth an unrivaled chemistry and presence. The flaws are also masked thanks to the amazing dialouge that makes this film the most quotable of its kind. Finally, the characters themselves make the flaws seemingly dissapear with their unique and inspiring behaviors. The one thing these fantastic elements don't cover up is the demand for the audience to be alert during its three-hour length because every one these element provides more insight into the film. But, I trust that as long as you don't fall asleep during the film, this won't be problem and The Godfather will seem just as virtually flawless as it is said by countless others before you.",positive

Hollywood Royal Classic !!,positive
"Ummm I love gangster movies and It took me years to actually get around to watching this one. Not as good as I thought it would be but a legendary cast make up for the slow parts(and there are many!)However despite praises of 'best movie of all time' or 'the perfect film' I still reserve those honors for Interview with the vampire,and Scarface! Gotta say in defense of this movie,How cool is Marlon Brando???(At least in this role)",negative
"After finally watching this film I can agree that this is one of the best films ever made. The acting in the film is what Schumacher and Senna were to F1, ie almost perfection. The plot is also substantial enough to warrant the length of the film, which is good, because I can't think of many other films which flow enough for you to start watching and then realise after its all over that you've been sat there for nearly three hours! Despite being excellent, with Marlon Brando showing why many consider him the greatest, the movie itself for me isn't, it is bettered, albeit by a small margin by The Shawshank redemption, which holds onto it's number 1 spot for now at least...",positive
"It's no reach to call this the best movie ever made. Brando and Pacino are iconic in the tale of crime, intrigue and revenge. ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""",positive
"This is one of those rare movies that is surprising in its scope. Its portrayal of the crime family's inner running's is original and, while not exactly authentic, close enough to call this historical fiction.",positive
Obra clasica del cine!!,positive
Absolute classic. Sometimes classic movies look outdated when you look at them some decades after the actual releasedate. This is definitely NOT the case with this movie.,positive
My personal classic... I've read and see it so many times I can't even remember...,positive
"Though I always found this movie to be a bit slow in pace- I always recognized it as a timeless classic. There will never be another film about a family involved in the mafia like this. Not to say there aren't other great movies out there themed as such, but to compare them with this movie would be arbitrary. The writing, acting, filming, and production of this movie were all almost flawless. It's not a movie I could watch twice in one year (do to the length), but it is a movie I can sit down and enjoy when I do have the time. I recommend this film to all crime-drama fans as well as fans of any Francis Ford Coppola's work.",positive
"A classic. Well acted, great story. Brought that gritty edge needed in a real mafia movie. You owe it to yourself to see this famous flick, because heaven forbid you ever have to admit to someone that you didn't see it. Hard to believe it's closing in on 40 years old!",positive

"Godfather is one of those classics that everyone will talk about for a long time to come. However personally, watching this movie is awfully painful for me, eventhough the plot is good, but the motion of the film is just so slow and boring and I kept on falling asleep. To be honest, although The Godfather is good but I think it is one of the biggest overrated film of all time.",positive
Such a classic! Is there anything more persuasive than a horse head in the bed? Now that's an offer nobody could refuse. My favorite scene is where Don Corleone is playing in the garden with his grandson and puts the orange peel in his mouth to frighten him. A masterpiece!,positive
How could I have possibly waited until now to see this film. Guess I just never came across it. So strange to see the cast at such young ages. Definitely left me wanting more. Good thing there are sequels.,positive

The father of all crime movies. Watch the rest of the trilogy and you will know this is true.,positive

"The ultimate movie about the Mafia, focuses on family issues as Vito Corleone has built up an empire of trust and certain balance. Still through the events of the film it shown to be a very fragile balance which is needing of a strong leader with neither too much rage or tepidness. The story begins at the wedding of his daughter. He is mostly back in the house meeting members of the family either swearing allegiance or asking for favors. Vito handles it all with fantastic grace that sets a tone that he is thought so highly of throughout the film and when he leaves a void with his near death from shots in the street it is understood just what it means to come into the family business and run it all. At first the eldest son, Sonny, played like a lightning rod by James Caan, takes the reins, but he is quite unsuccessful as he is too head strong rushing into things including a gruesome demise. It then falls to the youngest son, Michael Corleone, who is played by a young Al Pacino, who at first seems tepid, but throughout the course of the film shows an extreme growth to become in the mold of Vito through pain and excitement. What makes this film standout amongst others of its kind of pulp fiction like is the fact that it has such an outrageously great cast. They are fuelled by the leader Marlon Brando to turn out the best performances they could possibly do, this stands especially true of Al Pacino and James Caan whom never really matched their greatness in this film save Pacino in the second film in which he got to delve deeper in to the darkness. This is one of the ultimate crime sagas ever created and well deserving of its love.",positive
the best mob movie of all time.,positive
"Quite possibly the finest film ever made. Simple as that, the characters and script are first rate, and though a mob movie it's not about the violence, rather the family.",positive
"The best of Brando, Pacino and Coppola",positive
Greatest Movie Ever.,positive
"It may not be possible for a film to be faultless, but this certainly comes close. The ensemble cast are wholly convincing. The story progresses at perfectly measured pace, moving almost gently between moments of calculated violence. The cinematography and direction are perfect, with immaculate attention to detail. Every aspect of life in those turbulent times is faithfully recreated with great accuracy. I will give it 6 star if i can. Part 2 and 3 are also highly acclaimed",positive
"Epic, classic, timeless film, but... is it just me, or could it stand to be revamped? It's such an amazing film, but sometimes I feel like the low production values of the time get in the way of everything it could and should be. Regardless, I have, since having watched this movie, added the word ""garrote wire"" to my vocabulary, so evidently it made some sort of impact. =P",positive

"I think that after one watches ""The Godfather"" it is unfair to say that it is anything but a good movie. Because it is, the acting is excellent and completely memorable, the writing is good and the pace of the story is maintained over the 2hr plus running time. Also, the cinemotography is stunning, both personal and epic Coppola uses unexpected viewpoints and lighting to create a view that is both personal and distant. I must be truthful and say that this isn't one of my favorites, but I appreciate the artistry and talent that went into making this epic film.",positive
Almost perfect.. Brando was great..,positive
I have seen bits and pieces of this movie...probably enough to say that I have seen the WHOLE movie. The husband loves it.

"You already know The Godfather is the greatest film ever made. Why are you reading this? The Godfather, released in 1972, portrays a close knit Mafia family who must come to terms with it's leader's ill health, mostly from getting shot, and accept a new Don. I don't know much about cinematography, but I know The Godfather's is exceptional. The scene where Don Vito gets shot is wonderfully filmed. We see a side profile of his assailants rushing towards him, gradually gaining speed. He notices them. Side profile of them with guns. Don Vito runs. It's too late. A high shot shows him getting shot many times as he collapses over his car and onto the street. His son, Fredo, fumbles with his gun and realises the assassins are gone. All he can do his sit on the street and cry for his father. The Godfather's characters are truly spectacular portrayals, from hot-headed Sonny to cool Michael to innocent Connie and of course, Don Vito played by Marlon Brando. Michael, played by Al Pacino, is the main character and must transform himself from a war hero into a Mafioso to continue his family's legacy. Best film ever made. Simple.",positive
Great story + Great acting = Great Movie,positive
So sad that Marlon Brando participated in not so long time in this movie....,positive
"the movie of all time in my humble opinion. not before or since has there been a movie where everything has fallen into place with such perfection. the casting of so many great characters, an amazing story, acting of an incredible callibre a score to die for, beautiful cinematography and finally the subtle direction coppola was never going to equal. marlon brandos last great performance is searing in its intensity and he is almost matched by pacino, james caan, robert duvall etc. the passing of power from the father to the at first unwilling son is beautiful to watch and the violence wich entangles them though repellant is also fascinating. i doubt this film will ever be surpassed.",positive

"THE mob film. Coppola defined the genre, with his monumental project.",positive
"A masterpiece and a cinema classic. The Godfather is a true landmark film in cinema history. There are few movies that deliver compelling characters and a plot line that could keep my complete attention for the duration of the film as this did. In movies when characters die it has become such a common thing that it loses all meaning, not in this film I grew such an attachment to these characters that seeing any of them die brought waves of emotions over me. On the whole, a classic Mafia film that looks at the personal side and not just the crimes.",positive
"The Godfather is probably one of the best movies of all time. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Corleone is iconic, and the rest of the cast is just as amazing. Great story, directing, cinematography, music, everything.",positive

"One of those films that you can watch over and over and never get sick of cause it was so well written, directed and performed. Just watching this film gives you a sense of the power the Mafia families had and you can't help but feel you should sit and watch in silence as a mark of respect to the Don. What appeals most is that there is a system behind it all and every man within it knew his place (and feared stepping out of it lest they be punished).",positive

When I asked him about it, he simply shrugged and said ""It's some gangster movie from the 70's; your uncles loved it, though"". He let me take it home and watch it. I remember hearing the first notes to the ""Waltz of the Godfather"" as the movie began. To be quite honest, the movie, then and now, was 175 minutes of Hollywood nostalgic goodness. At the time, it was one of the coolest things I ever saw, surpassing even Pokemon in my little mind.[/font] [font=Times New Roman][/font] [font=Times New Roman]""The Godfather"" chronicles the story of The Corleone Family, an Italian-American familial criminal organization (a monarchical Mafia) headed by Don Vito Corleone (portrayed by Marlon Brando), whom is given the eponymous nickname ""Godfather"", and his fall from grace through the events in the movie (including his attempted assasination) which cause him to give over control to his sons. [/font] [font=Times New Roman][/font] [font=Times New Roman]Among the candidates for Don is his underboss and eldest son, Santino Corleone (portrayed by James Caan), his middle son Fredo Corleone (portrayed by John Cazale), and his youngest Michael (portrayed by Al Pacino). Even though Vito Corleone is the more popular of all the characters, it is his son Michael that is the protagonist, as he later becomes Don and is the ""Godfather"" of the second and third part.[/font] [font=Times New Roman][/font] [font=Times New Roman]At it's theatrical release, ""The Godfather"" was a box office smash, considered the very first ""mega-movie"" and the greatest blockbuster Hollywood's movie machine had ever cranked out. Nowadays, it is considered the greatest movie ever made by it's fans and casual movie-goers alike, and strikes a chord with critics from the past and present. [/font] [font=Times New Roman][/font] [font=Times New Roman]And, of course, with this critic as well.[/font] [font=Times New Roman][/font] [font=Times New Roman]""The Godfather"" presents universal themes of keeping family together, of love, and of protecting one's business that cultures around the world can understand and embrace. It typifies the violence, the greed and the stale mannerisms of the Mafia without glorifying it, and at the same time pleas for humanity, for sanity, and for justice.[/font] [font=Times New Roman][/font] [font=Times New Roman]""The Godfather"", in short words, makes it's viewers an offer they can't refuse.[/font]",positive

well put together movie. very interesting,positive
Unbelievably Awesome,positive
"Although gangster films have never been my favorite, I once again must give this film the credit and respect it deserves. A truly amazing masterpiece of American Cinema, I just wish I enjoyed gangster movies more than I do.",positive
Now this is some mafia movie...,negative
I think the godfather series gives a pretty accurate idea of mobsters back in that time. It is history. The cast is very talented,positive
Best movie ever made and the sequels too.,positive
Perfect film and great ensemble acting.,positive
"After so many years, still a great film.",positive
One of the flat out best movies ever made. They dont make them like this anymore. Amazing first installment to my favorite trilogy ever.,positive
Never understood the fascination with Mob movies this one is like them all just really long!,negative

"Before seeing this, I couldn't believe that there was a better movie than The Shawshank Redemption. However, this movie was ranked above Shawshank on the IMDB.com top 250 poll. Granted, they aren't always right, but I think they might be correct about this. If I look over the blood (which I think looks pretty fake), I believe I am correct in dubbing this a perfect movie. At least, there's nothing except that little flaw that [i]I[/i] find wrong with it. Exceptional cinematography, with an old fashioned calmness and dignity that gives the whole movie a classic feel. However, the key to this movie's greatness is the story- the characters. It recently occurred to me that plot driven movies and books, to put it bluntly, SUCK. Which is not to say this doesn't have an intricate plot- it definitely does. But the whole plot is about the characters and how they change and develop, which is infinitely better than a cool plot that only vaguely involves or uses the people to develop itself. [center][b]Bottom Line:[/b] [/center] [center][b]5/5[/b] [/center] [left][i]Possibly the best movie ever made. Lots of bloody violence, a little language, some nudity/sex.[/i] [/left]",positive
"alright, too long, the whole series.",negative
"One of the most entertaining movies. Its slow pace allows the audience to take in every character and every storyline. Brando creates one of the most popular and imitated characters of all time, with one of the finest performances of his career. Pacino show the full gamut of emotions going for soldier to godfather over the course of the film. Too many great performances almost spoil the film because you don't know who to focus on. The cinematography was too dark, that might be the only down side of the movie. The music, the characters, the story, the quotes, the apperance, all top notch.",positive
i have to look this all over again more carefully cuz its story is too complicated to understand at once,negative
Probably my favority movie of all times. This movie gives me chills. The music really makes it sumpin' special.,positive
very serious i dunno how i once survived a Godfather marathon XD,positive
the best gangster mo vie period,positive
the god father has a man who like to achieve many things and the great moment is when he travell the whole day.well i just like the story but it's a good Entertainmemt.,negative
"Stunning. No other word could describe this film. One of, if not the best, performance of the great Marlon Brando's career. Coppola's directing and use of light is brilliant. The score is one of the greatest in cinematic history. Too many actors give outstanding performances. Worth every bit of its Best Picture award and a must see for anyone.",positive
"I could watch this movie ""Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday...""",positive
"Nothing really needs to be said, if you haven't heard of this movie - that's sad. If you haven't seen it, you've been missing out on one of the greatest masterpieces of all time. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and all of 'em give their best performances to date.",positive
"A classic. An epic. A classic epic. Clemenza: ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.""",positive
The best of the three but all are great!,positive
"Got dammit! This is definetly a classic. Further more it is also one of my personal favourites together with The Godfather Part II and some other films. To be honest, After all this film could very well be the best I've ever seen. The story is so fantastic and all the acting permomances are just f***ing awesome..",positive
The Best Mafia movie ever.,positive
"stunning in every way ,brando and pacino were awesome in their portrayal of the corleone family, i especilly enjoyed the cinematrogrophy , casting and the brilliant soundtrack.coppola s best film",positive

One of the best all-time gangster films,positive
"I find it curious that it has taken me until this year to sit down and watch this movie from start to finish. I've often seen snippets at parties and walked in part way through. Such is the respect that it is held by my friends that I resisted the urge to only watch it ""part way"". I'm glad I perservered! It's brilliant. Brilliant in a finely balanced way from the tangible craft of movie making in composition, script, dialogue across to the technical aspects such as location setup, cinematography, lighting and constuming to the purely emotive ideals - musical score, acting and the impassioned execution. Again I say ""Brilliant!""",positive
the trilogi of all times.............,positive
"Despues de mas de 35 anos, The Godfather no ha perdido vigencia en ningun aspecto. Desde la inigualable actuacion de Marlon Brando hasta la clasica banda sonora, con una direccion por parte de Coppola que solo refleja genialidad y un guion tan solido como muy pocos, es simplemente una obra maestra.",positive

ummmm......greatest movie ever?,positive
The All-Time Greatest Trilogy!,positive
"Almost unarguably the best American movie ever made. Fantastic cast and a brilliant director, absolutely stunning, truly brilllant. I might just go watch it right now.",positive
"The ultimate movie about the Mafia, focuses on family issues as Vito Corleone has built up an empire of trust and certain balance. Still through the events of the film it shown to be a very fragile balance which is needing of a strong leader with neither too much rage or tepidness. The story begins at the wedding of his daughter. He is mostly back in the house meeting members of the family either swearing allegiance or asking for favors. Vito handles it all with fantastic grace that sets a tone that he is thought so highly of throughout the film and when he leaves a void with his near death from shots in the street it is understood just what it means to come into the family business and run it all. At first the eldest son, Sonny, played like a lightning rod by James Caan, takes the reins, but he is quite unsuccessful as he is too head strong rushing into things including a gruesome demise. It then falls to the youngest son, Michael Corleone, who is played by a young Al Pacino, who at first seems tepid, but throughout the course of the film shows an extreme growth to become in the mold of Vito through pain and excitement. What makes this film standout amongst others of its kind of pulp fiction like is the fact that it has such an outrageously great cast. They are fuelled by the leader Marlon Brando to turn out the best performances they could possibly do, this stands especially true of Al Pacino and James Caan whom never really matched their greatness in this film save Pacino in the second film in which he got to delve deeper in to the darkness. This is one of the ultimate crime sagas ever created and well deserving of its love.",positive
"seen bits of it, never had the paitence to sit through it all",positive
not as interesting as u may think,negative
Wildly appealing at least as much because of Gordon Willis's amazing cinematography and Nino Rota's score as anything Coppola did. I think it's a case of a good director competantly using great talent.,positive
Greatest gangster movie ever made? But wait.......this isn't Goodfellas?,negative
"one of the best work of coppola, and the best mafia movie",positive
"Masterfully directed, amazingly acted, there is no better film and probably will never be no better film than The Godfather. Marlon Brando stars in probably his best film since On The Waterfront, plays tha mafia boss Don Vito Corleone with such integrity and accuracy, he deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor. This was also the film that brought Al Pacino to stardom; he is now recognised as one of the greatest actors to have ever lived. This film is a must see! Any dounts, talk to Bill Derbyshire, he'll persuade you some more.",positive
this is rated number:1 this flim is one f the best,positive
"This is well nigh the perfect movie. the long and in depth look at the machinations of the mafia against the backdrop of powerful family drama makes for a movie that is timeless as well as brilliant. The only flaw is the fight scene with Sonny, such bad choreography! but it ends up becoming a framework for Sonny's own destruction and in that is the major contrast between Sonny, Don Corleone & Michael. The 2 latter being passive and skilled leaders of their syndicate whereas sonny is hotheaded and almost suicidal in his recklessness. By the end the cycle has gone through and there is a distinct resolution that seals the movie as a classic that needs to be seen by any serious film buff worth their salt",positive
"This is a classic.... Marlon Brando, Al Pacino.. so many great lines.. all the ingredients that make a movie great score 100% here: the script, the acting, the score... This movie is flawless",positive
Brando & Pacino make it a real treat to watch.the manual for anyone aspiring to make a gangster flick.,positive

The movie i watched the most. The Godfather trilogy is an all time classic.,positive
It's a bit dry for the first hour but then it gets going and it's super well done. A very good movie.,positive
The best of the best. Classic gangster action drama.,positive
"A brilliant crime epic that everyone has seen and knows how great it is. You know, this is out on Blu-Ray as ""The Coppola Restoration"", and it's now the definitive way to watch this film at home, at least until The Godfather 3D Deluxe Collector's Edition Box Set comes along (with Moe Green 3D glasses!). Hopefully not. It obviously doesn't have the clarity and color that more recent Blu-Ray releases have, and it doesn't need them. Instead we get a down and dirty spit shine, cleaning up the print and instead of trying too hard to conform to the new format, this presents the movies the way it's supposed to be seen.",positive
Fucking awesome film.,positive
"One of the greatest movies of all time. A miraculously rare instance of ""better than the book.""",positive
"This is my favorite movie of all time. The villain is our hero. Amazing mix of action, romance, an just emotional pull that has you gripping your seat for the answers. It went right up to number one on my list after seeing it, and I will never think the same again. Al Pacino also became my all-time favorite actor through this movie. And even though he is getting old..he's still got it.",positive
"i'll make em an offer he cant refuse,lol",positive
"This is where it all began.. Gangsters and death, u cant take this awat from The Godfather",positive
"What else is there to say? One of the all-time greats, and a film that must be seen by anyone who claims to be a movie fan.",positive
"Very well told and very believable stories and characters. The Corleone crime family will make you an offer you cannot refuse. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall are all absolutely fantastic. Very well could be the best movie ever made, although not my all time favorite. That doesn't make a lot of sense..",positive
"The best film of all time. Absolutely brilliant filmmaking, a flawless movie. It doesn't get any better than this.",positive
Simplemente perfecta,positive
"Next to ""Citizen Kane"" probably the best American movie ever made. It has it all (great acting, cinematography, writing etc).",positive
Who can refuse this movie,positive
Love what the director did in this movie. The insides of a mob family. Brando's character shares my business motto with the world and than I will make an offer he can't refuse.,positive
The Best movie of all time!!! No question...,positive
"I've never been a massive fan of gangster movies, however everything about the godfather is great. It lasts for 3 hours yet you wont look at your watch once. You must see if from the start though, because otherwise you'll find it very hard to follow.",positive

One of the greatest movies ever made. A must see for any one.,positive
This is the best movie of all time. That's all I have to say.,positive
one of my favorites!,positive
absolutely fantabulous loved it. fantastic and brilliant.,positive
"i had high expectations for this film, and they where surpassed. brilliant film making. much more violence than i thought.",positive
Best movie ever made!,positive
YOu know I loved it. But unfortunatly I cannot expose myself or my children to this lifestyle.,positive
Who didn't see this movie and didn't fall in love with it?,positive
simply the greatest film ever made..they don't make it like this anymore..,positive
it was great but got better in the next movie to the sequel.,positive
"Superb cast, great directing...we all know the rest!",positive
"the great Italian epic. Wonderful acting. Amazing scenery. Gut wrenching story. Film students should be tied down and forced at gun point to watch this and have shouted at them over and over ""THIS IS HOW TO MAKE A MOVIE!!!!!""",positive
Ive never seen this before until a couple of days ago. Now I am ashamed at myself for committing such an atrocity. This is the best Al Pacino film not counting part 2 until Ive seen it.,positive
La trilogÃ­a es una oda al cine......lo mejor de lo mejor !!!!,positive
I can immerse myself in this movie. Just to watch Al Pacino's character mature is worth 10 stars. He is subtle and and perfect. Marlon commands the screen. The baptism scene thrills me as does the ending. The door closing in Diane Keaton's face? Pricelees.,positive
"really, really, really good",positive
A near masterpiece. Still like the second one more.,positive
Epic and engrossing. Amazing movie about horrible movie. I get chocked up when Diane Keaton gets the door shut on her.,positive
This is truly the Best movie I own!!! I love Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are my fravorit actors hands down. Did you even know Al Pacino was the only character to play in All series?!!!,positive
It was wierd and long,negative
"It's difficult to view such an influential film without being aware of how many later works have borrowed from it. A couple of things: performances are pretty much timeless, cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen and the direction and screenplay are masterful.",positive
One of the greatest films ever made,positive
One of the BEST all time Gangster movies!!!,positive
Le meilleur film de tous les temps,positive
"just got the Coppola restoration box set and watched all 3 with a week just stunning - the performances, cinematography are near flawless. pacino is incredible in the subtlenessof his portrayal of an unwilling heir to business he wants nothing to with - but due events beyond his control becomes a murderer and eventually head of the Corleone family. brando gives an unparalled performance as the powerful but aging don Vito just terrific movies (the 1st 2 especially) but even the much maligned 3rd has its merits",positive
The Don of all Mob movies. The Mother of all Gangster films. I bow down and give all I have to this film. It made me an offer... and I couldn't refuse.,positive
the best movie ever made,positive
Muestra como el respeto por la familia y los mayores es cuestiÃ³n de honor. Esta es de mis favoritas,positive

probably the best movie ever made,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
"me encanta esta trilogÃ­a, marlon brandon es un genio...clasico de los 80's",positive
Honestly i found it boring. I could not make it through the whole movie.,negative
Do I really need to say anything?,positive
Marlon Brandon a true don corleone....superb!,positive
Marlon Brando confirms what everyone already knew - that he is one of the best of all time - and acts his way into legend by portraying the Don like only a true genius could. Francis Coppola is in inspired form and the rest of the cast is flawless. I only give it 4 and a bit because the second one is even better.,positive
this whole series moved too slow for me.,negative
"What can be said about the greatness of ""The Godfather?"" At its heart, this film is about family and the American Dream. What makes it important is the interaction between love, death, loyalty, and morals. Simply wonderful. And, hey, remember when Pacino could underact?",positive
No words are needed here,positive
BEST MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN!!!,positive
a supposed to be classic?? i think...lol i liked it!!!,positive
"Like most people, I consider this one of the very best movies ever made!",positive

"Duh. If it's on my top ten, it's going to get 5 stars. I love the whole trilogy.",positive
"Five stars. Great, ultimate gangster movie. The one that started it all. Enough said.",positive
"All time greatest film every made. Coppala truely turned something that almost fell apart into a true master peice. Marlon Brando, an uncontrollable force made his unual and unorathadox beheavoir into an unforgetable roll that is ranked all time greatest rolls every played.",positive
biggest gangster classic ever,positive
"I gave this little film 5 stars because the application won't allow me to give it 25 and a half -I'm still coping with it. What can I say? Coppola, Brando, Pacino and Rota. What else can you ask for?",positive
all time classic... this film is the yard stick for any film maker to work to.,positive
"The best gangster epic ever. This includes The Godfather II which in my opinion was better than the first. I am a big fan of the writer Mario Puzo. If you love the movie, you will really love the book.",positive
By far one of the greatest movies ever. Not to mention that it has so many references in popular culture,positive
So good a movie Coppola made it twice. Central to the movie is the slow isolation its central charachter Michael Corleone who through each act of violence becomes desensitized. And the chilling scene matched by the terrific musical score sees Corleone alone in the forest like some aging king. A masterpiece.,positive
This movie is a must have on the movie collection... just a perfect movie of great acting and great storytelling,positive
"I still like this movie, but it doesn't really knock my socks off anymore. This kind of mythologizing of the mafia seems really flawed in retrospect, especially in comparison to more realistic fare like GoodFellas.",positive
finally saw this movie and wasn't disappointed,positive
The best movie i have seen.,positive
definitely the very best.....,positive
What can you say about a classic?,positive
"Good, really good. But the older you are the better it is.",positive
Best. Movie. Ever.,positive
"One of the best movies of all times,with Al Pacino and Marlon Brando it just rock outs.. If you hadnÂ´t seen it go right now to ur closer blockbuster!!",positive
"Though being overly dramatic, this film remians to be a favorite because it shows what the people want to see in a gangster film: violence, drama, and conspiracies. And you will know why Marlon Brando is the true Godfather of them all.",positive
pure movie gold. if you havent seen it then i feel sorry for you.,positive
"Overrated. somewhat boring at times, with long scenic shots with no purpose. Very Complex plot with fairly good acting from the leads. The way woman are treated & portayed in this film is offensive. I think that's why Men like it so much...",negative
Awesome movie! From beginning to end the story full of revenge and hatred keeps you excited and clinged to your seats. Only problem of the movie is its length !! 3 hours !! It was really very difficult to finish the whole movie in one go.,positive
"""an offer you can't refuse""",positive
I`ll make you an offer you canÂ´t refuse.....,positive
these movies are the best in the world i can watch them over and over and over again. there is variety in them action family love drama so much in a movie. you should watch and three in a sitting!!!!,positive
An all time classic and with out a doubt the best movie ever made. Coppola tells the only true story of an italian mob family. The movie moves very fast but touches base at many important factors that relate to a crime life.,positive
"My ""top movie of all time"" swings back and forth between this and Kane, but I lean toward the Don for powerhouse acting, gut-wrenching suspense and overall entertainment value.",positive
One of the best movies ever made..........,positive
I think it's one of the greatest movie that ever made. Puzo's novel is great and Francis Ford Coppola could bring the story into a great motion picture.,positive
The whole trilogy was a masterpiece,positive

Trench coats. Fedoras. Random shoot-outs. Manly weeping. Manly kissing. Violence. Italians. Epic one-liners. Exotic accents. The kitten in Don Vito's arms... In other words - stylistically pure stuff. [img]http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e295/HPforgrownups/TOTALLY%20NEW/GodfatherTheG_BRT-1.jpg[/img][/color] [color=#003300]Corleones in da house! With Coppola's and Puzo's timeless morality tale (children, crime is bad for you). What can I say about this that hasn't already been said... Everything about this movie is art - from the script to the acting to the cinematography. It is a tremendous motion picture. It set [/color][color=#003300]the standards for all other Hollywood blockbusters that have followed. It is the most quoted, copied and parodied movie of all time (after the original Star Wars trilogy). It resurrected the legendary Marlon Brando's career and made the back then unknown Al Pacino a superstar. What I found is basically a sophisticated and masterfully executed storytelling on screen, boasting a cast of unforgettable characters. Vito and Michael have become cinematic icons by now, Robert Duvall IS Tom Hagen and Diane Keaton Kay Adams. This movie features some of the most outstanding acting that I've ever seen. Brando's presence is obviously huge, giving pathos to Don Vito, and by the end of the movie it is hard to drag eyes away from Pacino, who is rather mesmerizing as the central figure of this tragedy. James Caan and Talia Shire who play Sonny and Connie Corleone do a superb job. John Cazale (Fredo) gets to shine more in Part II. The film is packed with who's who of 70s character actors. Everybody has a very naturalistic aura to them, which leaves the impression that you're observing a bunch of real people going about their business in the real world. [img]http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e295/HPforgrownups/TOTALLY%20NEW/godfat3.jpg[/img] Also, what astonishes me is how soulful the movie feels and how romantic it looks, despite of its reprehensible subject matter. The shadowy sepia tones of goldish brown serve to create atmosphere, to deepen the characters and mystify their motives even more, whereas the sunlit wine-coloured scenes in Sicily are just simply gorgeous. The storyline builds with deliberate slow tension until it culminates in the metaphor-heavy ""baptism scene""; against the ceremonial backdrop of the holy Catholic Church the most condemnable of all sins is commited and the new Godfather is ""inaugurated"". It is all blended together seamlessly - thematically and symbolically. [img]http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e295/HPforgrownups/TOTALLY%20NEW/036godfather.jpg[/img] The Godfather is a masterpiece. If you appreciate well told stories of love, loyalty, betrayal and revenge, you should fall under the spell of this one. And when you watch it, don't forget the soundtrack. The music is used quite economically in the film, but hearing it in full enriches the experience; it's very tender and Italian and the famous Love Theme sweeps you away (check out Slash's guitar version as well). I have a weakness for all things Italian anyway, so... I guess in that sense I was destined to love The Godfather, lol.

Apollonia's (Apollo = Greek god of sunlight) presence is brief, but pivotal. She is the image of the mythological Goddess, innocence and beauty in an elemental form - a last chance for Michael to forsake his destiny, to embrace another.

The best...something women will never understand....Don Corleone...The Real Man,positive
I own these...never can get enough of the Godfather...Let's go to the mattress's!!!,positive
One of the best of all time!,positive
give u lesson to be a great ever mafia. nice storyline. brilliant.,positive
"One of my favorite pictures, period. Excellent on every level, Marlon Brando, the period piece itself, the cinematography is out of this world, and it leads into a very satisfying sequel.",positive
A magnificent picture and possibly the greatest movie of all time.,positive
Best movie of all time.....,positive
What can be said about this classic that you haven't heard a million times already?Superb acting excellent story and cinematic perfection.,positive
Great film about an Italian mob's family and how much they are willing to go through for family and power.,positive
a masterpiece of the modern world. spectaculatar,positive
mieux impossible si ce n est le 2,positive
"I finally saw this movie, and I have to say it was awesome. It lived up to the hype: great cast, great story, and overall great movie. It's pretty long, but I have to say I enjoyed it and it always kept me interested. Classic and brilliant movie",positive
"IMDB's top rated movie. Many critics consider this to be the 'perfect' film. Its 3h long, but it flies by. Great acting and great scenes.",positive
"Simply the third best film of all time, in case you are wondering Schindler's list and Citizen Kane are ahead. I have seen it over 20 times and still not fed up seeing it. The cinematography the story, the acting simply just a great film yet another year where the Academy really didn't need to have a show, they could have just given all the awards to this show.",positive
Gangster masterpiece. Brando at his best.,positive
This movie is awsome!,positive
Love it it's my novela LOL,positive
what can i say i'm Italian,positive
"Outstanding. This is a Masterpiece. Marlon Brando gave ""the performance of performances"" in this epic movie of life in the mafia. This one movie lauched carrers of such actors as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Cann. Talia Shire of Rocky is also in here as Don Carleone's daughter. This movie is wonderful.This is my personal favorite of the series. I definatley recommend this to everyone.",positive
marlon the great at his best,positive
One of the greatest movies ever. The end.,positive
the godfather..........enough said,positive
Only one word: incredible.,positive
"I was hoping the whole 'being the greatest movie of all time' thing wouldn't screw with my perception of the film, but it definately did. After I watched it, I kept looking for an excuse to give it 5 stars... but I just couldn't find it. There's everything in it except a statement or philosophy.",positive
The first sequel to win an Academy Award for Best Picture....... that tells hell lota abt it,positive
"Pt 1 and 2 were amazing cinematic achievements, pt 3 was a total crapfest",positive
"Without doubt, an absoltue cinematic masterpiece, this epic tale is both fascnating and moving featuring awesome performances from the principal actors and support cast alike and despite being much mimced and parodied, Marlon Brando's performance and the portrayals in the film, raise the bar for every film that has followed.",positive
I love this movie It has got to be the greatest movie ever made It's an American classic even though it takes a long time to watch,positive
"Is there anything left to say? A work in its own right, didn't think about the book once while watching it. And, I'll marry Michael!",positive
"This is it, the Alpha and Omega of mobster movies.",positive
This is my favorite movie EVER.,positive
The best movie in the history,positive
"a great mafia movie, with brilliant performances and good characters",positive
without a doubt the best movie ever made the overall talent and direction of this film has no equal i could watch it a thousand times,positive
Better than the book.,positive
The gangster movie by which all others are judged.,positive
"One of the greatest Italian mob sagas ever made, the Godfather is actually really good, even if you don't like mob movies that much. Francis Ford Coppola proves he is the Man. Al Pachino and cast are brilliant.",positive
This in my opinion is the best film ever made! I loved this movie! It is defeitnately worth watching.,positive
arguably the greatest movie of all time.,positive
to this day i still can't get through the whole movie...sorry,negative
Great... Francis Ford Coppola signed his name on the Hall Of Fame of the history,positive
"the best movie about the mob. one of the best movies in general. perfect acting, music, directing, story & dialogue. A perfect package of a movie.",positive
"The BEST cast of all time. Now, what does it mean about me that I'm attracted to Michael Corleone?",positive
Best crime movie that can be created by man-kind and beyond,positive
this is an offer you CAN'T refuse.... watch this film and you get to see Brando in one of his finest acting scenes.....Buenissimo,positive
The definitive tale of organized crime in America!!,positive
"Some call this the greatest movie ever made, some say it has the best acting ever, some even say another movie like it could never be made again. When considerin the movie and those statements, i could not agree more.",positive
it was so good!!!!Marlon Brando,positive
"Apparently this is the greatest movie ever, and it may very well be for what it is and how it has changed the movie industry. Quite very well done in almost every aspect from Coppola's directing to Marlon Brando's brilliant performance. Although slow at times, it is still very interesting and definitely worth watching (hundreds of Simpsons jokes suddenly make sense now).",positive
"An epic film. Great directing by Francis Ford Coppola. The performances were brilliant from Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Jimmy Caan and Diane Keaton. Cinematography was great. One of the best films made.",positive
"To be honest, I just saw this movie for the first time last year. I know, I know. See it ASAP if you haven't already. Brilliant! All of the great things people say about this movie are true. One of the best ever!",positive
As close to a perfect movie as you can get!,positive
"I think the main reason why this one will always be more loved than the sequal, which is arguably the better of the two, is because of the warm glow that comes from its sense of family. This is a movie that you can just sink into as the story unfolds so effortlessly before your eyes. Watching Michael's slow change into the hollow shell that he eventually becomes in number two is a painfull joy to watch - and the step by step process of him taking up his father's crown is so brilliantly portrayed: His father passing on the last of his knowledge before dying; Michael becoming the godfather to his sister's child and then finally, what is perhaps the single greatest closing to a movie ever; When after lying to his wife about murdering his brother-in-law, she steps out of his office believing in him, only to then see his men kissing his hand in respect before closing the door to his world on her - forever.",positive
A wonderful study into the mechanics of a Mafia family. Brando and Pacino (both of whom the studio did not want) give unforgettable performances. In fact the whole cast are great. Although I prefer the 2nd they are both great to watch together.,positive
"WOW. Engrossingly entertaining, amazing acting, brilliant storyline and editing. Major props to Francis Ford Coppola for casting unknowns/against type.",positive
best ganster film! al pacino is awesome in this,positive
My favorite movie! Nothing like it! An American classic! This is one legendary movie!,positive
Feh. At least I can say I saw it now. The best part was watching a young Al Pacino answer his calling in life.,negative
The best out of 3 installments thegodfather is a great movie that is full of coolness,positive
Symbolises the italian mafia culture to date. much more than a movie actually.,positive
"Great epic film, probably only bettered by Part II",positive
the most over rated filme ever! i hate it!,negative
Min 2ahsan el 2aflam ely momken tshofha,positive
Don't go buying farm animals while doing business with the mob!,positive
The all time classic,positive
"Even more brilliant than I remember it being. One of the most beautiful, rich, perfect films ever made - there's really nothing else that needs to be said.",positive
Greatest Movie Ever Made!!!,positive
Long and aggravatingly boring. Sorry!,negative
De las mejores de todos los tiampos.,positive
"I feel bad saying this, but I hated this movie.",negative
Emblema sin duda. Excelente film en muchÃ­simos aspectos...,positive
i don't think i really need to write anything here. this movie speaks for itself,positive
Really is as good as people say it is.,positive
"greatest ganster movie of all time. ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
"Iconic. Strong performances, moody music. Nothing like a period piece that actually pays attention to the ""when"" part of things. There's a lot in the book that's not in the movie - but that's all right.",positive
Coppola afto ta leei ola...,positive
"outstanding,everthing that a gangster film shud be about",positive
A great movie Marlon Brando does a great job as the Godfather.,positive
"Brando, Coppola and Mario Puzo's novel make this film the best gangster film ever. My rating is only 4 starts because I'm not a big face of gangster movies but I can see the appeal and I can certainly see why everyone loved this.",positive
They don't make films this good anymore,positive
Definately one of the best films of all time.,positive
THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS IN THE WORLD AND HAS ENSPIRED ME IN SO MANY WAYS,positive
"A great, great movie. Story, acting, score. The descent of Michael to the level of his fmaily due to love for his father was a studyin ethics and destiny.",positive
classic. super classic.,positive
"the strongest out of all of them, they should have left it at this and be done with it",positive
This movie is an epic modern greek tragedy that goes far beyond the mobster genre.,positive
"The book is better than the movies, and you need to see both I and II for the complete story, but reading the book first is better.",positive
A cinematic masterpiece.,negative
A flawless movie. The best movie ever made.,positive
One of the best film's ever made. A classic!,positive
"Simply incredible, best out of the trilogy hands down.",positive
"It's the all American classic. It's widely considered the bast movie ever made, and with good reason. No matter how many great things you've heard about this movie, it will live up to all your expectations.",positive
".I never wanted to see The Godfather. I always thought I would hate it and that it was probably overrated; fortunately, I was incredibly mistaken. The film is amazing, fast-faced for a film of its length, and leaves you wanting more. Sadly, this eventually led to The Godfather Part III.",positive
"It's the fuckin' Godfather, what can I say?",positive
UHH! Den er jo faktisk ret sej..,negative
Das Beste Aus Alles!!,positive
best film ever by a mile!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
One of the greatest films ever made. However the 2nd one is slightly better. Marlon Brando puts on a powerful performance,positive
One of the greatest films of all time.,positive
"Greatest movie ever. Directing, acting, mood, feeling, everything.",positive
Classic. Great movie,positive
po meni bi dobio i 8 zvjezdica kad bi ih toliko bilo!!,positive
"classic, epic, life changing are a few words that come to mind",positive
Must See! The Godfather is a movie.,positive
"I absolutely love this movie, and I never get tired of watching it ever!",positive
"I can't believe none of my friends have seen this film. Considered filmmaking at its best, the Godfather has a special place in moving picture history. I couldnt help but sympathize with the mafia, especially Michael, who undergoes an amazing transformation. The score fits with the feel of the movie perfectly. There were parts that i was confused with the first time I saw it, but I'm certain those places would clear up if I see it again.",positive
the best movie i have ever seen,positive
It's frickin amazing.,positive
"It is interesting to watch this classic movie again after seeing Danzel Washington's American Gangsters, because they both talked about the rise of African American gangs by dealing drugs and the decline of traditional Italian families. From different perspectives, these two movies showed a very interesting comparison between these two powers. Of course, the close tie within a family is a main theme of this movie. Michael gradually slipped into the abyss of crime and evil as his father's health getting worse. His brother was killed, and it seemed inevitable for him to be the head of the Corleones. The Godfather was also a human being, so his heart also had a gentle side, for his family members only though. Watching Marlon Brando playing with his grandson, Anthony, in the yard, and then falling down to the ground, I also felt sad for the death of this old man, although he was also head of a crime organization too. Perhaps it is just me, I would ask who is the real godfather, who controls other people's lives. It seems that the Corleones and other Italian families had great powers to kill and to commit crime without being punished, but who gave them powers and protections to do these? Politicians. It is too dirty for me to keep typing about this topic, so I will stop here. This is definitely a classic movie deserving all compliments it received during the past decades. It is a milestone in the history of movies, especially the gangster movies. (complaint: I don't know who I should hate, because my review was cleared after leaving it idling for a while. Now I have to re-type everything...)",positive
"This perhaps on of my favorite films of all time. The pace, the acting, the music. It brings a smile to my face just thinking about it.",positive
awesome!!! it was kinda boring at the beginning but then at the end you just want to keep on watching them!!!,positive
classic best film ever!,positive
"Una obra maestra de Francis Ford Coppola, un clÃ¡sico en la historia del cine mundial y una brillante actuaciÃ³n del gran Marlon brando al igual que Al Pacino. Muy recomendable. 3 Horas que se pasan muy rÃ¡pidas. No por nada es la #1 en IMDB.",positive
"gang movies, i never thought could have such material and relevance such as this. it was worth my time. i watched it to only make a review and i did not think I would like it.",positive
"what can I say, one of the best movies with my boy Al Pacino",positive
The greatest movie of all times and i never get tired of watching it over and over,positive
The best mafia/ family drama movie!!! With the magestrial Marlon Brando and charismatic Al Pacino. The only movie you can't refuse!!!,positive
"""One of the greatest movies of all time""",positive
Who doesnt like this movie??,positive
"It was intense! I liked the horse head in his bed! Not my taste, but great acting.",positive
Hey! it's The Godfather! An American Classic.,positive
"Mumble, mumble, mumble - bang, bang - mumble, mumble, mumble. Seriously though, some really fine performances in an occasionally slow epic. Found it more enjoyable watching it as part of the trilogy.",negative
Best film ever made...,positive
best movie of all time nuff said.,positive
"la trilogia, imperdible...",positive
"So I finally watched this and it just doesn't have the impact that I'm sure it had when it came out. There's nothing wrong with it, I think just the history of mafia movies since then, while maybe not as good have deluted this. For example I'm not saying it's not better than Sopranos but at a basic level I didn't get any more out of it. I didn't come out thinking ""wow, amazing"". I just came out thinking ""hmmm, another mafia story""",negative
[font=Courier New]SIMPLY THE BEST[/font] [font=Courier New][/font],positive
"This movie is amazing. It has so many quotes that people still use today like, ""You come to me on the day of my daughters wedding."" and s*it like that. This movie is great. I personally like how you never know when it's going to end. It adds the perfect suspence to it. Like if someone gets shot and the movies allready been going on for an 2 hours and your thinking, ""Am I going to have to see The Godfather 2 to find out whats going to happen or is this movie going to continue so long that it solves ANOTHER conflict. You know how most movies have like one conflict and the entire movie there trying to solve that one conflict and then they do and it's over. This movie will solve tons of conflicts and even SOME they DON'T solve making it seem more life like. Overall this movie is the s*it.",positive
"Sensational film. Pacino is awesome, Brando is awesome. Doesn't get much better than this.",positive
"almost made me believe in god, it was so good",positive
"This movie really sets the standard for all mob movies that will ever be made. I liked the book better, but this isn't a bad interpretation of it at all. The acting is there (i mean c'mon, it's marlon brando), as are the plot and the effects. A definite must see.",positive
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse. :),positive
Love Marlon Brando's performance in this,positive
'dont faget the canolies!',positive
The Ultimate MOB flick! No Doubt!,positive
"I got the chance to see this and PArt 2 on the big screen and my god what an experience! I actually think my personal choice is this one. I just really love seeing the whole family together. And seeing Michael go through the change and become The Don. Absoultely incredible film. Perfect in everyway possible. What the hell happened to this guy? He used to make great films, and i'm not talking about Jack.",positive
"You don't have to worry about nothing, I'm not gonna criticize this movie and all. I understand my position is, I understand how <b><u><font size=""3"">BIG</font></u></b> the movie is, so I ain't gonna say no words to criticize it, otherwise I want to be called the rudest person in the world. But here are few thoughts.<br> <b>Francis Ford Coppola is a movie god for making this movie, he's slightly the best director of all time.</b> And there's no one can replace Marlon Brando here, <b>Don Corleone is no doubt the best character ever made in a movie.</b> And there is no one, I mean <b><u><font size=""3"">NO ONE</font></u></b> can play the role Don Corleone, except Brando, otherwise nobody can guarantee that <i>The Godfather</i> is still <i>#1 in IMDB, 1973 Academy Award's Best Picture</i>, and with no any hesitation, <B><U><font size=""3"">THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL-TIME.</font></u></b><p> <div align=""center""><a href=""http://imageshack.us""><img src=""http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/2819/thegodfatherbrandoaaa7.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us""/></a><p><i>I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.</i><br> <b>-Marlon Brando as Don Corleone-</b></div><p>",positive

"Brilliant!! Love these movies! Bake a lasagna, get some red wine, have friends over for a marathon! ""Leave the gun, take the canoli.""",positive
"Who hasn't heard of the Godfather? But who has actually seen it? Not enough. Enough would be everyone. So people, enjoy. Movies dont get much better than this.",positive
"Just saw it for the first time -finally, indeed. Interesting how this man can talk Italo-English with stuffed cheeks and still be relatively understandable. What an achievement.",positive
"So well done, so many great performances!",positive
Best Gangster movie ever !,positive

classic. my fav. movie,positive
really good. but kinda confusing..,positive
Not as good as the book though,positive

One of the best films ever made.,positive
A true American classic film. They do not get much better.,positive

i have the whole series i love these movies and can watch them all the time. mob movies i tend to like alot. all time classic movies u have got to have a special liking 4 these kind of movies this is one of my favorites,positive
"One of those movies that manages to actually live up to years of its hype... The perfect gangster film! A film that shows that it isn't the violence that makes the mafia bad, but all of the countless other actions. The most violent scene in the film isn't even a scene where anyone dies, but the famous closing scene where Michael Corleone lies to his wife and the door to his office slowly closes, as if to signify him shutting her out completely. This film is sheer brilliance!",positive
"I have seen parts, and those parts were pretty good!",positive
A true American Classic,positive

A classic among classics.,positive
"This is basically the Bible to countless filmmakers. I don't think it lives THAT much up to the hype, but the movie is pretty much flawless.",positive
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse,positive

Power of the Head of the Family,positive

"When a movie changes your life and adds character to you as a person, it will truly be a movie that you will always keep close to your heart.",positive

Probably the best movie I have every seen. This is a must see.,positive
"Pure classic, and the closest thing to a perfect movie anyone will ever see.",positive
really good storyline and good acting,positive
an excellent movie.... anything else i say will just be a repetition of what millions of fans have already shared....,positive
Great movie. I enjoyed this completley. This is one of the movies that deserved every award. Marlon Brando is terrific in this movie.,positive
I didn't give it 5 stars because i think the godfather 2 is even better... so... it was really hard to rate it below 5 ^_^,positive
excelente inicio de la saga de los corleonne,positive

best gangster movie of all time,positive
"This is, at least in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made, every thing just comes together perfectly, for me to explain why, would take hours and many many pages, just go watch it, then watch it 5 more times",positive
"Brilliant film about the mob, especially James Caan's performance as the wayward, violent brother.",positive
"It's a little long for my taste, but overall a fantastic film. I loved the close-ups. A classic.",positive

Favorite moviee of all time.,positive
Al Pacino has never looked so good. Marlon Brando has never acted so good. Makes me want to go to Sicily hard. Effing love this movie.,positive
"This is one of those very rare movies that deserves all the praise it gets. I can't think of any real flaw this movie has. An amazing group of actors including a pre-outrageous Al Pacino. Has one of my favorite opening as well as closing scenes (screw you, Kay).",positive
this is an offer nobody should refuse,positive
Enough said. It is in every single persons top ten list since 1972.,positive
The best movie of all time!,positive

fantastic movie....marlon brado oscar best actor in leading but why al pacino isn 't oscar best actor in supporting role???????,positive
This is a masterpiece movie,positive
"I'm sure it would've been so much better if I was alive and saw it in 1972. Unfortunately, all the lame-ass popular culture references that have surfaced since then have ruined a good portion of the movie when I sat down and watched it. Such as Sonny getting shot a billion times. Ridiculous. Still good though, just a bit overrated and predictable due to those pop-culture references. Bastards.",positive
"Absolutely fantastic mafia film, second to none - a timeless epic...",positive
AFI's number 2 greatest movie of all time. It is brilliant,positive

interesting..... but its way too long.. it felt like the story was never goin to end...,negative
"Esta no es una pelicula, no. Es.., LA PELICULA. Y no tiene tres partes. Es que es una cinta muy larga. Una leccion como novela y como guion. La direccion de actores es asombrosa. La puesta en escena, monumental. Y la fotografia, el montaje y la musica, irrepetibles. Dicen, que desde su estreno los sindicatos llaman a Coppola..., el director de la Mafia. Imprescindible.",positive
One of my favorite movies of all times...,positive

For the last few years, not seeing this film has been my greatest cinematic shortcoming and now that issue has remedied. It was exciting that a film didn't disappoint for once. Every element of The Godfather is pretty spectacular. The acting, script and film making were all top tier and it's easily the best mobster movie I have ever seen. There were still some small issues with it though. It was a little self-indulgent at times and I found the selective translation of the Italian dialogue to be a problem. It should go without saying that this is an absolute must see, so see it if you haven't already.[/size][/b] [/left] [size=4][b] [img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size] [size=4][b]First Review [/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size] [size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size][size=4][b] Public's (IMDB) Rating: 9.2 [/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size] [size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img] [/b][/size][size=4][b]Critic's (Tomatometer) Rating: 100% [/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img] [/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size] [size=4][b]Academy Award ""Best Picture"" Winner [/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size] [size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size][size=4][b][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b][/size] [size=4][b]IMDB Top 250!

Like Tom Hanks said in You've got mail - The Godfather is the I Ching - It teaches you close to everything you need to know for life! Masterpiece - The best movie adaptation I've seen thus far - keeps true to the Novel all the way!,positive
This movie was very powerful i have never seen it before but i am sure it was good.,positive
the first one is the best,positive
one of thegreat films of all time and one of the very few that carries off the book to movie transition perfectly!,positive
"What can yoy say, one of the greatest films ever. I think that the better actor was Al Pacino as against Marlon Brando.",positive
The Godfather and The Godfather Part II are a simply must-sees .. Even better if you can view the story in chronological order.,positive
"-after watching it again, i appreciated this movie way more. i'm not even going to try to put a review into words.",positive
best film of all time a classic !watch you won't be disappointed,positive
ALL 3 FILMS ARE GREAT 3 HOURS LONG THE STORY OF THE MAFIA BRILLIANT,positive
My All Time Favorites and the Father of Gang Movies,positive
Movie of the century,positive
one of the best movies ever.,positive
"You mention this film, and some sort of phase, or mental image is imagined in someone's mind of how family business is conducted with this Mario Puzo's movie. Well made brando was great in these.",positive
"Stunningly shot, brilliantly acted and chock full of genuinely defining moments, The Godfather is nothing short of magisterial. In short its an offer you can't refuse....",positive
"So I fell asleep, but I was really really tired. So maybe I would enjoy it if I was in a better frame of mind?",negative
"Must watch in: -chronological order -uninterrupted attention -afternoon before 2:00 PM The entire saga is Part I, Part II, Part III. Try to watch the version with uncut scenes/director's unedited version. I remember the scene where the dying man begs Godfather to stay with him so death will see him and flee. Most versions DON'T include that clip.",positive
"Tienen que verla, pero la mejor es la II parte, bueno es lo que yo creo, aunque la tercera igual esta a la altura. Te hacen sentirrrrr.",positive
"Even for the sake of organizing my own thoughts, I don't need to write much about this masterwork. Perhaps the best constructed movie of all time, The Godfather is basically Hamlet, only more so, and not quite everyone is dead at the end. I think that makes sense if you've seen the movie. Others have already articulated its brilliance well enough.",positive
And let there be this movie. And cinema was born.,positive
"Classic that every guy must see, its like a right of passage.",positive
masterpiece... da best eva mafia movie... notin cud beat dis...,positive
Just a classic movie. In my top ten.,positive
Brilliant adaptation.,positive
The beginning of a classic trilogy and a classic in its own right. Brando and Pacino work so well together and Duvall is excellent (shame he more or less disappears in the other movies).,positive
"I just watched this movie again last night. It took me 23 years to finally watch and now I've watched it on average about 5 times a year since then. Incredible acting. Unbelieveable story. Brando, Pacino, Duvall and Coppola at their best. ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.""",positive
absolutely incredible! da original is da best one.,positive
ovviamente capolavoro assoluto..mai visto un film portare meglio gli anni che ha sulle spalle..,positive
"So I was a bit slow to catch on, once I read the first book I couldn't stop and then I watched the movies.",positive
The best mob movie there is.,positive
the greatest movie EVER in the history of mankind!!,positive
"Great movie that is, I think, a little overhyped, but nonetheless a great story and great acting.",positive
The film is superbly directed and some of the best acting you will see from brando pacino duvall and keaton. An enthralling look into a little known world at the time truely revolutionary in the crime genre.,positive
Every 10 min someone is vilently murdered... that's about it.,negative

"probabilmente il miglior ""mafia movie"" di sempre, o almeno deve essere cosi visto che Ã¨ alla base di tanti altri film nel settore! Grande Al Pacino, fenomenale l'iceberg Brando!",positive
"I know it's blasphemous: but I think the Godfather is overrated. Yes, Michael's transformation is amazing, the story-telling is textbook, and the movie is solid and entertaining. However, I felt myself waiting for a climax, like the movie was going nowhere. And yeah, Marlon Brando's performance is labeled as iconic. But his mumbling came off to me as completely unnecessary.",positive
the best movie of all times,positive
This movie is up there as one of the best movies ever.,positive
Close to perfect. A true of example of film making at it's very best.,positive
"Probably the best movie ever made. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall are amazing as hell. THis film is perfect for any generation and the story is hell of a godly one.",positive
=)...the best movie ever,positive
The best of the best. Simply Superb,positive
"Michael's journey from the man who wants to do good to the man who runs the family is amazing. From the time he lights his cigarette with a calm, steady hand we know that its in his DNA. Its always on TV somewhere and I always stop to watch it.",positive
What can be said that hasn't been said already? Arguably a perfect film from beginning to end.,positive
brando and pacino's best performances.,positive
"One of the best movies!! Great casting including Brando, Pacino, Duvall. Obvisouly won the oscar for best movie.",positive
"Wow, what a movie!!! It's fantastic :D",positive
"If there will ever by a movie as well made as this one, I hope I'm alive to see it; Coppola's and Puzi's script and the former's camera work is used in the most effective way. Wonderful cast, superb acting.",positive
the best of all time classic,positive
"The best movie of all time. The only movie to win Best Picture, and have the sequel do the same.",positive
"Eh, it was ok, not nearly the ""amazing, stupendous classic"" that everyone says it is, but it isn't as bad as the first time I saw it.",negative
A timeless gangster epic that plays out like a greek tragedy.,positive
Seen 14 times...and still loveing it!,positive
Who doesn't like the godfather?,positive
Stands alone as king.,positive
A masterpiece of film. Absolute classic.,positive
"Sure, 36 years after the fact it's become the source of catch phrases and punchlines, but the first in this series about the Corleone family still stands strong. Intoxicating story, knockout performances and laser precise directing is why 'The Godfather' will long be a standard for which other movies can only hope to achieve.",positive
"This movies has some of the best actors ever, this is a must see",positive
It's cliche to say. But this is the best movie ever made.,positive
"This is the BEST movie of all time. I know there are 'countdowns' that put Citizen Kane ahead of Godfather, but there's no comparison. The drama, the characters, the cast! Above all is the story of Michael's transformation from the rebel non-conforming son to the guardian and ruler of the family.",positive
beautiful use of power and one of d most interestin films ever,positive
Greatest movie of all time.,positive
"Epic? Like a good crap, perhaps?",negative
"Best mafia movie ever, uncontested. It's subtle, and some people call it slow, but that's just because he was focusing more on making an incredible movie than keeping the ignorant masses entertained.",positive
The best of the 3. Hail Marlon!,positive
"""Leave the gun take the canoli.""",positive
"The only question is, ""is one better than two or is two better than one?"" Well, that and, ""what happened to Coppola that inspired him to make that piece of crap that was the third?""",positive
"Simplemente la mejor Peli, aunke aun no veo The Citizen Kane",positive
"It's the absolute greatest movie of all time, hands-down.",positive
Great way to spend 3 hours,positive
greatest mafia movie of all time.,positive
"Rather than repeating what has been said a hundred times already about this American film classic, I will make you an offer that you cannot refuse: A list of the top ten reasons to watch the Godfather: 10. The late great John Cazale. 9. Marlon Brando is back with a performance uniquely his own. 8. James Caan. IMO, his best performance ever & the best character in the movie. 7. All the ""oranges=death/violent act"" scenes. 6. Apollonia!!! 5. Vito Corleone's ""...And that I do not forgive"" speech during the meeting of the criminal masterminds. 4. Lines like ""Sleeping with the fishes"" or "" Time to take out the mattresses"", phrases that have since become part of popular culture. 3. Sonny's death scene. 2. The theme song. 1. Francis Ford Coppola's masterful use of foreshadowing. Example:When Luca Brasi ( the guy who ends up sleeping with the fishes) goes to make a deal with the rival crime-family, he walks thru a glass door that leads to the bar where he will meet his end. As the door closes, the scene is shot looking at Luca from behind, setting up the shot to so that you will notice fish designs that have been engraved into the glass & give the impression that they are surrounding Luca's body. Awesome. Simply awesome.",positive
2nd greatest movie ever made.,positive
"Freakin' great movie, if you haven't seen it you should be beaten with an oar. If you have and didn't like it, you should be beaten with something heavier than an oar.",positive
"La trama y su desarrollo, su ritmo, etc, es tal vez la mas perfecta en toda la historia del cine. El personaje, mas que memorable. A alguna gente le gusto mas la segnda parte pero yo me quedo con esta...me parece mejor lograda, menos saturada en lo visual. Obra maestra!",positive
"If you like mafia, then you have to like the Godfather",positive
This is still one of the best movies ever!,positive
Greatest movie ever!!!,positive
Really seems before it's time. Great acting. Very slow paced though.,positive
Not a fan of mob movies but i thought this one actually was good.,negative
MAN MADE STUFF. TESTOSTERONE,positive

A slow but powerful movie. Contains some of cinema's most famous scenes.,positive
One of the best movies of all times based on one of the greatest books of all times. Al pacino and the whole cast is great. The movie is captivating and truely captures the book.,positive
I don't think I need to add to everyone else's review. One of the best movies of all time.,positive
"Leave the gun, take the cannoli",positive
if you do not like this movie: get help.,positive
"The BEST Movie of all time. Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, etc. This is the story of a crime boss, which shows his son's rise to power. You must watch it.",positive
"godfather is what started the gangster movies this flim is the shit ,pacino gives a great performance in one of best movies ever made",positive
One of the most amazing movies. Must see.,positive

"Slow-paced, neat, and clean, a great movies!",positive
Never could get tired of The Godfather...fabulous!,positive
"First off, I didn't know Al Pacino was so hot when he was young. With that said, finally at 26 and 27, Jeff and I watched this trilogy for the first time and this one moved up to top of best movies ever seen.",positive
"The grand-daddy of all casts. The grand-daddy of all scores. The grand-daddy of all epicness. The grand-daddy of... well, most everything. I would say Al Pacino > Marlon Brando, but either way, watch it. There's a few flaws that spoil the film somewhat, but Coppola is a victim of the technical limitations of the times.",positive
One of the best movies ever made!,positive
"I watched all these way back, and should probably watch them again, but from what I remember is they were all good but sometimes a little sluggish.",positive

"Along with Shawshank Redemption most probably one of the Best Films of all time. Pure Class. Acting, Screen Play, Score, Direction. Best film of the 70s Golden Era",positive
"*Re-Review* Having just finished a second viewing of this film, I still stick to my original thoughts on it being a pure masterpiece. But, flaws do exist in the movie, mainly the pacing after the midpoint. The movie was wonderful momentum and a superb story in the first half, but the second beings to drag slightly. A lot of scenes with Marlon Brando also seem ridiculous when you watch them closely, but the movie still feels brand new in the Year 2008, which is saying a lot for a 36 year old film. Definitely see this, but do not expect it to be the best thing ever, because it simply is not.",positive
OMG - one of the best movies of all time. This and GFII - classics. I once watched all 3 backtoback with friends. Intense!,positive
One of the greatest.,positive

"scénario bien écrit, mise en scène irréprochable, bon casting...",positive
respect the family!!! a classic depiction of gangster. awesome,positive
"An incredible adaptation of the greatest American novel. Three oscar winning actors (Brando, Pacino, Duvall), an Oscar winning actress (Keaton) and other stars like James Caan all combine to make this arguably the greatest American movie. Michael wants to be a professor, or anything other than part of his father's organization, but in the end is the top mobster in the US.",positive
I had the entire collection including the bonus disc but it was also stolen.,positive

Amazing...dunno what to say...greatest movie maybe?,positive
"A film that stands perfect the way it is. There is no way you can't call this a perfect movie. It desecribes every last detail of everything in it. I consider this the greatest crime movie of all time, as it shows justice and evil both at once. Francis Ford Coppola has brought a different view of filming into the movie world, as he has made a marvelous triumphant motion picture, with a great story and a great characters portrayed by a great cast. Astounding, just astounding.",positive

one of the best movies i have ever seen..,positive
"Possibly the greatest film ever made. A bold claim, but one that it is completely defensible. The storyline keeps one mesmerised, as it weaves themes of power, morality, family, love and betrayal seamlessly together in an almost perfect balance, without ever sacrificing the pacing of the film. The dialogue is pitch perfect; barely a word is wasted. The meeting at the end between the Don and Michael, where the older man expresses his disappointment is a masterpiece of economy. And then the acting. Superb performances from all the principles, right down to Petey Clemenza (played by Richard S. Castellano) keep the viewer riveted. It's the sort of film that bears repeated viewing. A work of art.",positive
I can honestly say with the upmost seriousness that I would not mind watching this film over and over again for the rest of my life. It is fantastic and quite possibly the perfect movie.,positive
"The movie that gave a whole new meaning to the word ""respect""",positive

"Tremenda, mi pelicula Favorita",positive
i like the 3 movies.,positive
"The stuff of movie legend, Francis Ford Coppola's truly epic crime saga is a sprawling family drama, slow-burning thriller and a masterclass in ensemble acting all at once. It's easy to get caught up in the myth surrounding the film, but little needs to be said about a film that constantly excites and enthralls time and time again. The cast is simply faultless, with Al Pacino holding his own as he steadily assumes his father's role. James Caan is also tense and explosive as hot-head Sonny, whilst Duvall plays consigliere Tom Hagen with a quiet but firm dignity. Of course, the most memorable performance is reserved for Marlon Brando's Don Corleone: soft-spoken, leonine, caring yet convincing as a man responsible for the murders of countless hundreds, it's a virtuoso, iconic performance. With superb photography by Gordon Willis and Nino Rota's classic, swooningly nostalgic score, this is a film that ranks among the greatest ever. Unmissable",positive
"An all time great. I am amazed that such a good movie could come out of 1972. I love this movie. Especially with a plate of spaghetti, or some pizza. I love it. Easily the best Mafia movie ever.",positive
il fait toujours partie de mon quotidien.,positive
amazing. short sweet and to the point,positive
"one of the best films of a1ll times. If you dont like this movie at least you should admire it. It not only a mafia movie but a movie about a family. The acting is spectacular, specially from pacino. Duvall is also incredble. A ckassic no one can miss",positive
Probably the best onscreen adaptation of a novel.,positive
THE Perfect Cast in THE Great American Movie.,positive
the only movie better is part 2,positive
The best movie ever! Al Pacino and Marlon Brando... what else can you ask for. Not to menttion Robert Deniro in part II and III. I feel like a Corleone Myself.,positive
"Brilliant! Its the acting that made this movie great, but a good storyline, memorable scenes and decent directing.",positive
Alot better than i remember.,positive
"One of the best movies ever made! All of the actors in this movie play their parts well, and the plot is very solid! A must see for every movie lover!",positive
what is there to say.... epic! truly a masterpiece!,positive
The greatest film ever made.,positive
"Brilliant!! Yes, it's long, but let's face it, it is a classic and I love it:)))",positive
fantastic movie!! seen it over 30/35 times..........the more u watch it ......the more u learn!!,positive
I don't know what to say except that the italian girl was unbelievably gorgeous.,positive
Quite possibly my favorite movie ever.,positive
i'm italian so i gotta give it up to this movie,positive
"I honestly couldn't make it through the whole movie. It was slow, and boring lol",negative
AMAZING! BEST MOVIE EVER,positive
"Fantastic movie, a bit too lengthy for my tastes but oh well.",positive
Like you have to ask.,positive
"Culte, tout simplement. Un indispensable du cinema, comme ses suites d'ailleurs.",positive
"The standard in mafia movies, yes?",positive
don viti corleone....,negative
"A true epic, an in depth look at the world mafia world of favours and family. Brando and Pacino are outstanding.",positive
Best movie i've ever seen.,positive
YYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS,positive
una de las mejores peliculas que he visto,positive
"This is the greatest gangster movie ever. Not only does it stay true to the era, but it also acurately depicts the Italian mob. Top notch acting, directing, score, and so many classic lines and scenes.",positive
Absolutely great film. The only argument I would accept against it being a full 5 stars is that it is slow at times and very long. The ending could not be more worth the wait though...,positive
I can watch this movie over and over and over again and never tire from it,positive
Saga que hay que disfrutar en vida!!!!.... inperdible!,positive
this movie will ALWAYS remain at the top of my list. AMAZING!!!!,positive
"It speaks for it's self. If you have a question in life,watch the godfather",positive
"This is one of the greatest films ever made. Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it. I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.",positive
"Complex, endlessly quotable, and filled with great performances (my favorites are Brando as Don Corleone and Duvall as the Family lawyer), this is my absolute favorite movie. See it.",positive
Perhaps one of the best films ever? Never gets old. NEVER.,positive
This Was A Great Mafia Movie Loved It With Passion.,positive
My all-time favorite movie! Al Pacino is incredible!,positive
"A well-told intricate tale on the evolution of an underworld family. The highlight of the film was Brando's superb performance, and was well supported by the rest of the high quality cast. The story, music, and direction were all good. It was quite a realistic film, which kept it engaging and had good dialogues, mostly from Brando. He was the soul of the movie and commanded attention everytime he appreared in a scene. However, I do not consider this the best mafia movie ever. For me, Scarface, Casino, & The Departed were much more entertaining. But this is certainly a classic, worth seeing & owning by all mafia film fans.",positive
"perfect, great script, great performances, great music, the greatest movie ever.",positive
"La Mejor Trilogia en la historia del cine, Actuaciones, Direccion, Guion, todo perfecto",positive
this is a clasic.a must seefor everyone,positive
"""the entire series is a classic....clearly.",positive
"It's pretty good, im big into gang films so this was my style.",positive
this was surprising good.,positive
Â¡Quiero ser como Vito Corleone!,positive
"Possibly the greatest gangster as well as greastest film of all time. It has excellent acting by marlo brando, al pacino, james caan and robert duvall. powerful directing by francis ford coppola.This film also has one of the greatest legacies of all time. This film is a true classic and an unforgettable masterpiece",positive
"The most widely recognised gangster movie ever made. The theme song, the dialogue, the performance from Brando, everyone has heard of it and with good reason. Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Keaton all give superb performance but all are seconded by Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. The film was actually overseen by the real life Mafia and ex-members of it acted in it, Luca Brazzi for one, an ex-gangster hitman. Whether the cinema goer knows this or nor, it will not detract from the fact that this is one of the most genuine gangster movies ever made, one of Coppolla's masterpieces and just a true, tuue, Titan of cinema",positive
THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,positive
Never gets boring !!!,positive
"Rien a dire dessus, sinon qu'il a un peu vieilli. Je me suis surprise a decrocher, mais rien de grave, ca ne dure pas longtemps ... A noter : le casting parfait.",positive
best mafia film ever made!!!,positive
Probably may favorite movie of all time.,positive
"Hey, listen, I want somebody good, and I mean very good, to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that bathroom with just his dick in his hands, alright?",positive
"I have always liked this movie, the topic, the details, how the story evolves... and now that I see it again... well, it makes me realize that all changes to stay the same...",positive
"I will make him an offer that he can not refuse.""",positive
"The only people who see this movie and don't love it are the ones who sleep through it or don't pay attention. This movie is more and more breathtaking every time I see it. When I was little and my family joked about how our family is from Corleone, Sicily, I thought it was stupid that they made such a big deal about this movie. Boy was I wrong, and now this is my favourite movie of all time.",positive
"What else can I say, except that I can watch this film over and over and still find something new in it that I missed the first 100 times I saw it. Excellence all around.",positive
Brando's performance could easily be dismissed as hammy if he were not such a good actor.,positive
Everything you need to know about business is right here. An MBA you can earn while watching some of the best acting in motion picture history.,positive
Bored to tears. Heard it was better than Goodfellas. No way!,negative
Greatest gangster movie ever made.,positive

"Mindblowing of an age of classic film. Brando, Pacino, and Coppolas to boot. Vey powerful in every which way!",positive
"""leave the gun, take the cannolli's"" is one of my all time fave quotes - brando is pure class",positive
"A breatkthrough gangster film for its time- epic scope, powerful acting, and a mob you could actually care for",positive
how can i refuse !! lol 5 stars,positive
"Without a doubt the greatest movie of all time. It defines American movies and the ""American Dream."" Everything about it is impeccable; the acting, lighting, story, music, characters, dialogue, EVERYTHING! No movie will ever touch this one. Every time I watch it, it gets better and better.",positive
ive only seen half of this movie!,positive
Greatest Film Ever Produced,positive
ultimate Mafia movie of all time.,positive
100% i LOVE this movie!!!!,positive

ti farÃ² un offerta che non potrai rifiutare,positive
One of the GREATEST movies of ALL TIME!!!!,positive
"Best film ever! Excellent actors (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando), script, direction, photography and score (one of best's ever)",positive
It gets a bit boring talking about how good this film is. But it is that good.,positive
definitely my in my top 5 ever,positive
ITS A AWSOME FILM......... WORTH WATCHING IT.........,positive
It won Best Picture for a reason. Downfall: Over glorifies the mob.,positive
"This pioneering and quintessential Mafie/Cosa Nostra/Mob classic timelessly makes you ""an offer you can't refuse"" in terms of brilliant performances and production values. Brando's mumbling incoherence proved to be perfect in this film, which delivered breakout performances by James Caan and newcomer Al Pacino. Always imitated, but never matched, ""The Godfather"" continues to be the template for other works in this genre.",positive
all movies should be this good,positive
"There are no weaknesses to this movie; the acting, the directing, the cinematography, everything is as good as it could get, except maybe for Diane Keaton's performance.",positive
Una de mis favoritas,positive
One of the 3 best films ever made.,positive
The greatest of all time!,positive
one of my top favorite movies of all time.,positive
it's hard for me to follow but i played the game and it seems just like grandtheft aut only u need to protect the family and its buisness,negative
The movie that changed it all,positive
What can you really say about The Godfather? Brando and Pacino of course make the movie and despite the movie nearly being 3 hours it never really drags as you remain enthralled in the film for the entire time.,positive
"One of the best films ever created, the story, filming, acting, script is air-tight!! Lasts 3 hours and you don't even see the time fly by!",positive
"one of the best, if not THE best, movies ever made, without a doubt.",positive
The best Mafia movie ever...,positive

"Never was into crime dramas, but the acting is wonderful.",negative
Esta es sin duda la mejor pelÃ­cula de todos los tiempos. Tienes que verla.,positive
"Anyone who doesn't understand that this film is a masterpiece, simply hasn't been watching movies in the last 30 years or so. The Godfather was named in the top three movies of the last century by the American Film Institute, beaten only by Citizen Kane and Casablanca. The amazing thing is, that doesn't feel likr hype, it feels right. Francis Ford Coppola's loving portrait of the Corleone crime family is violent, touching, exciting and intelligent in equal measure. No easy task coming from Mario Puzo's potboiler of a novel that is a complete letdown if read after seeing the film. Really, folks, Coppola infuses so much of his own italian upbringing into the movie that it is a rare case where it trancends the printed material. There is no reason to read the novel, in my humble opinion. The cast, led by Marlon Brando, in all his iconic glory as Don Vito Corleone, are uniformly top-notch across the board. Even day players and one-line characters are fully inhabited. Al Pacino slides from the sunny all-American college-boy war hero to the sullen, brooding crime lord with every nuance you could ever hope to see. James Caan is like an erupting volcano as eldest son, Sonny Corleone. The taken-too-soon John Cazale strikes just the right note for the doomed (oh, but that would be telling!) son Fredo. In fact, Cazale is front and center in my favorite scene in the film, the attempted assasination of Don Corleone. Brando is caught in a hail of gunfire, and Fredo jumps from the car...and drops his pistol. The shooters speed off, and Fredo sinks to the car's bumper, weeping and screaming ""Papa!"" at his fallen father. It's a scene that feels absolutely at home in both a mafia picture, and a family drama, which is the genius of The Godfather. Brando gets top billing, and all the attention, (it's certainly one of his best performances) but Pacino is the real star. Michael sells his soul in this film, and set into motion the events that would grow to torture him in the sequels that followed. The true tradegy is that he does it all for love, love of his family, his children, his father. Coppola strikes the perfect notes over and over, showing how such great love and loyalty can pull a noble sould straight into hell. The movie is also beautiful, stunning, in fact. That's, however, no real surprise, it is a Francis Ford Coppola movie. Yes, Coppola took a rapid, disasterous downward turn in later years, somewhere after Tucker: A Man and His Dream, (which is a masterpiece in it's own right) but in the 70's I don't think he could make an ugly picture. Even if it was supposed to be ugly. I'll devote a few words to the sequels. Many, many people consider The Godfather, Part II (1974) to be superior to the original. I do not agree, but that being said, it's a more than worthy continuation of Michael's story, where we see how much damage the evil he has commited has caused. The Godfather, Part III (1990) is clearly the least of the three, but I think unfairly maligned. If the film had been titled ""The Family,"" and the characters not named Corleone, it would've been received as an excellent film, marred by one weak performance. (Even with the Legacy hanging over it, it still gained a Best Picture Nomination) Don't let anyone convince you it's terrible or unwatchable, and it does end Michael's story in a satisfying manner.",positive
"Let me start by saying... [b]IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS MOVIE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING!!! [/b]This is the pinnacle of all movies out there. Nothing can compete with this true beauty. The acting is phenomenal from each and every character. The Godfather himself, AMAZING! The plot is one of a kind. A must watch. I cannot describe the Godfather in anyother way. It is your average ""The Family"" aka (mafia) movie with so much more. Each line is a great. Here is a glimpse of some quotes... Michael Corleone: My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Kay Adams: What was that? Michael: Luca Brasi, held a gun to his head, and my father assured him, that either his brain or his signature would be on the contract. Don Corleone: Do you spend time with your family? Good. Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man. Don Corleone: You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? --- After remembering the last quote I have written down. The third quote above. I remember it, the truly touching line. This movie may want you to put your head down for a moment and say 'picture what it's like for him'. Marlon Brando is the perfect actor for this position. Once again, a must watch film.",positive
Greatest fuckin' movie in the history of the universe.,positive
One of my favorite movies of all time! It's my favorite of the trilogy.,positive
muy buena las actuacion son muy buenas sobresaliendo el buen trabajo actoral de marlon brando y el de al pacino me encanta la quimica de los dos con respecto a los personajes,positive
"This is what true movie is, only those who have seen this and the trilogy will understand what i am saying. but for those who dont... i encourage all too see this.",positive
What can you say about the grandaddy of mobster movies that hasn't already been said. This movie sees a young Pacino at the start of his career alongside Brando who hadn't made a decent movie in years. It's interesting to note that studio bosses were against both actors appearing. Frances Ford Coppolla insisted otherwise and the rest is history. What results is a powerhouse of a tale with an excellent cast and superb source material from Mario Puzo. Classic cinema at it's finest.,positive
"Another of the greatest movies ever made by anyone, anywhere, any time. While some genre-defining works become stale, or cliche from better subsequent works, Coppola's film only gets better and more powerful with age. And absolutely mesmerizing story that I don't get tired of watching.",positive
A piece of classic cinema.,positive
I really loved this movie a lot,positive
One of the best movies ive ever seen. but at some parts the movie is hard to understand because of the strong Italian accents,positive
I mean really who doesn't like this movie???It's the best:),positive
"THE best organized crime movie, action, intrigue, suspense, good actors (Brando). This movie represents the real life in crime.",positive
"Sin duda una obra maestra del cine de todos los tiempos, una de mis favoritas, que vuelvo a ver cada tres o cuatro aÃ±os como mucho",positive
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.,positive

"One of the best movies of all time, but must be seen on DVD, uncut. Pacino is incredible, Brando brilliant, and the script enthralling.",positive
my favorite movie !!!!,positive
"A masterpiece! This truly is cinematic storytelling at its best. Perfect casting of the most memorable characters that you totally feel for. The mood, the era, that music, those lines... May well be my favourite movie of all time.",positive
The greatest ever made.,positive
"The greatest piece of American cinema ever produced. I have watched ""Citizen Kane"" and re-watched ""Citizen Kane""...it does not do for me, or for movie-going audiences, what ""The Godfather"" has done. From the moment the score is played on the screen, the person watching is cautiously welcomed into the world of 1940's New York crime bosses. Sounds like an exciting action film, but it does something different. For once, crime, when the protagonist is a criminal, is not romanticised. This film epitomizes America for so many immigrants...we are all descended from immigrants. This film embodies the American dilemma of family vs. business (or career). Promises, loyalty, true friendship, sacrificed love, ""going to the matresses""...they are exhibited in this single film. If I were stranded on a desert island with only one movie...it might be this one - with emphasis on the ""might"".",positive
"Esta pelicula la vi cuando pequeÃ±o y no le di importancia, despues de en el 2008 la vi y quede LOCO, muy buena trama, las actuaciones son notables y bueno retrata muy bien el tiempo en el cual estan viviendo... la recomiendo a quien quiera ver buen cine y de CULTO!",positive

brilliant the whole cast are great too!!!,positive

are you serious? This is only one of the best films ever made.,positive
"The best movie of all time. The plot unfolds like a perfect Shakespearean tragedy. Art like this is often imitated, but rarely perfected. Performances by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and especially James Caan as Sonny, punctuate the already magnificent plot.",positive
kinda boring but pretty gud!,negative
this movie is fucking awesome.,positive
Regarded by many as the greatest movie ever made ... it wasn't,positive
"""Make him and offer he can't refuse."" I love mob movies",positive

"Classique qui vieilli mais sans vraiment viellir. Excellent, toujours, je ne crois pas que je me tannerai un jour de le revoir!",positive
"Hands down one of the greatest american films of all time. great perfomances by Marlon Brando, James Caan , Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino.The story of a 40's crime family trying to survive a potential takeover by rivaling families and adjust to the rise of successor Michael Corleone(played brillantly by Pacino) as the new godfather of the family taking over his father Vito(a momentual perfomace by Brando)",positive
brilliant film almost as good as the book,positive
"The Godfather rates as one of the finest pieces of storytelling cinema has ever produced. Coppola has adapted Puzo's novel, along with the author, to create a story that intertwines family values, power, corruption, loyalty, betrayal, violence, love and marriage. Pacino's Michael Corleone is a masterpiece of screenwriting and acting, portraying the innocent war hero who's soul is corrupted by the desire to retain the family honour. Only Brando's Vito and Duvall's Ben manage to maintain their integrity by the final act. Coppola has provided cinema with a movie with perfect casting, perfect acting, a great balance of humour, drama, action, and (vitally) insight into character, that makes the 3hr running time race by. Very few modern filmmakers can boast the same.",positive
"Amazing film, just the flow of it. Absolutely a good movie. It's amazing to think that they were trying to stop it, the whole production.",positive

"I'm going to say, somewhat stereotypically that (aside from citizen Kane) this is the best film ever made.",positive
Must see. Fantastic story.,positive
"The story is tense, and several scenes got my heart rate up. The characters are very good, with Brando and Pacino leading the way in an excellent cast. Being 3 hours, it can be slow at times. But the ending was one of the best I have ever seen. All in all, a fantastic movie. I can see why it is so loved.",positive
The best movie I've ever seen in my life,positive
"Long, Yes..but a classic in every sense of the word..story-telling so immense...you have to watch all 3 from begining to end..",positive

best movie of all time,positive
I'll give a rating you can't refuse. This movie is amazing! Such a classic!,positive
This is one of my favorite movies the godfather was a true ganster who was difined not by how he acted or dressed but what he had to do as a man and a father,positive
"Ummm...Pacino, Brando, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, Robert Duvall and James Caan! What's there not to like about this fucking masterpiece?! The greatest movie ever made and I'm not the only one who says so.",positive
"No other movie has successfully portrayed the best and worst of humanity quite like The Godfather. From the very beginning the movie clenches your heartstrings and doesn't let go until the very end. From the heart wrenching story to the beautifully haunting soundtrack, to the wonderfully memorable characters portrayed by some of the greatest actors in history, The Godfather is easily one of the best movies of all time, and deserves never to be forgotten.",positive
"Who can forget ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
Such a wonderful story. One of my favorites.,positive
"If you haven't seen this movie, you don't like movies. Arguably the best movie ever made. Side Note: Brando didn't deserve the Oscar but Pacino did.",positive

"1. Class! the hole long way!! There will never be a movie good enough to beat this, that Is So impossible!!",positive
"I've now officially decided to never again decide that I won't care for a film before having watched it. ""The Godfather"" is, in a word, astonishing. It made me nostalgic for an Italian Mafia that I've never known.",positive

"Amazing casting, amazing acting, Amazing plot, wow this movie was nothing short of amazing",positive
We all love this movie. If it doesn't get 5-stars than waht does. I love watching Brando go to work.,positive
"I rented this movie for three main reasons. First, I love mafia movies. Secondly, it's a classic, so I felt like I really should see it. Third, I felt like I was missing out on a lot of pop-culture references. It was a great movie, although some parts were difficult to determine why exactly they were included. I assume they will be cleared up in the second and third installments. My only complaint is that some parts are hard to follow because many of the characters are dressed in the exact same attire (trench coats and fedoras) which makes it hard to keep track of who is whom. It's not so bad that you can't follow and enjoy the whole movie, though. Aside from that, I really loved this movie and I can't wait to see parts II and III.",positive
"Absolutely brilliant, I had never wanted to even see this but I am glad thst I gave it a shot. wow",positive
"Everyone can tell whats going to happen. Yet the anticipation always gets your heart rate accelarating. So many memorable scenes, brilliant acting and powerful use of imagery and music. My favourite movie? No. The best movie I've seen? Yes.",positive

The Greatest Movie of All-Time,positive
"This movie is as close to perfect as it gets. Easily the best movie of ALL TIME. The only imperfection is when the punches didn't always connect when Sonny attacked that lady. Other than that, everyone filled their role to perfection. Always will be a classic.",positive
"The best Hollywood-made film ever! All-star cast, all-star director, and all-star writing (Mario Puzo). How do you beat that? Hands downs, the best Hollywood-made film ever...PERIOD!",positive
Vastly entertaining on all levels.,positive
"Epic drama depicting the trials and tribulations of a New York crime organized crime family. Empasizing on Family values, morals and corruption, it is a movie which gathers pace and reaches an explosive conclusion with the annialation of rival family bossess and the assumption of power by the Corleone family headed by Michael Powerful performances by James Caan as the hot tempered Santino, John Cazale in the role of the mild and meek second brother Fredo, the unbalanced and misguided Daughter Connie and Marlon Brando as the ageing don but for me it is a story about the rise and rise of Micheal Corleone. Outwardly the mild mannered but inwardly ruthless younger son who grasps the essence of the movie with an unyealding grip. His performance surpassess all in his steady ascendency to power and the title of the don. A timeless classic, controversial in it's day which stands the test of time and remains ageless today. A steady plot accumilating in a profound and gripping climax. A terrific asseble of stars. An outstanding movie",positive
Just one word can be used to describe this film: Perfect,positive
"Um yeah... it's the f*cking Godfather. People don't realize that when this came out in 1972, it was the most innovative film ever created. Combine that with an ALL STAR cast and you get the greatest movie ever made. Anything less than 5 stars is an insult.",positive

"I have just watched The Godfather. Amazing! I have watched it 36 years ago, and I could remember several scenes. However, it looks like a fresh movie. No doubt it is a classic. Impressive to watch actors which I got used over those years at their start. Incredible, how Duvall, Pacino, Keaton were so young. Well  There are unforgotten scenes: the weeding, the car bombing, the heart attack, the horse head, the last counsel to Michael (the one that approaches you for a meeting will be the traitor). Those scenes somehow were wired in my brain for so many years. What is sad is the vision that the narcotics would be the criminal activity of the future. It is scaring that somehow this was already seen as a trend 36 years ago! We failed to react, and now we have to live with the evils that comes from this activity.",positive

"Enfin, j'ai vu ce monument! Il est à la hauteur de sa réputation. Une bonne histoire, des acteurs solides, une trame sonore de premier choix et une photographie superbe. Il n'y a absolument rien de mal à en dire, sinon qu'il y a bien quelques longueurs çà et là, mais rien de très lourd pour un film de trois heures qui arrive tout de même à garder l'attention et l'intérêt du spectateur. Vraiment une production épique, débordante de personnages de toutes sortes supportés par une intrigue complexe et bien ficelée. Un excellent travail de ""storytelling"".",positive

The film for better and for worse established the Italian family. It faithfully showed the customs and whatnot. Integrating that to the Italian mob. Starring a great cast some known and some relatively new at the time. Pacino established himself as a great actor for the generation and Brando again gave a critical worthy performance. It's dark and *at the time* graphic mob violence.,positive

What can I say? I'm a woman who loves the Godfather triology.,positive
"what's the difference between Gangster and Policeman? actually no essential difference. only you should pay money to different group for protection. one is called tax, and another is called illegal protection fee. i believe both of these two groups doing the same business, some of which are under morality, while some are not. sometimes they need cooperate with each other, sometimes they fight because of unevenly distribution of interest. but the problem is, when you need help, who will be your first choice? as to me, maybe Don Corleone, cos he seems much more charming than that ugly Sollozzo. and maybe cos he doesn;t apologize to take care of his family.",positive

"Don't you have to give this a 5? Just because? This was an all-time great film. The writing, the directing, the acting. Everything seemed perfect. I will not take any points off of the movie for really anything. That said, it's not my favorite movie, or even in my top 5, because I didn't really get any sort of feeling watching it. With Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood, there's a feeling when you get a metaphor or watch a specific scene and you just get this emotion. I never really clicked with the director's ideas and emotions but this is still probably the greatest achievement in film of all time.",positive
My god... What a movie... This deserves more than 5 stars...Every aspect of this movie is artistic and admirable.. Brando & Pacino are amazing as well as the other cast.. Coppolla does a good job as director and Puzo has done a good job with the story... The Soundtrack is great... But this isn't a movie for the people who doesn't admire artisticness and have a poor concentration...,positive
the best film of all time,positive
The only perfect film,positive
"If this isn't the greatest film ever made, then it's certainly unquestionably one of them and if you don't think so objectively then you are a certified grade A dumb bastard. Honestly. But don't be offended by that because it took me 30 years to watch this movie and it was more than I expected it to be. It's about family and blood ties, with Michael being forced to step up and take the Corleone family reigns after a series of violent attacks leave him no choice. The family is tight circles like these and this gives you a great example of that.",positive

"There are films, and then there are motion picture experiences. These experiences can change you, alter the way you think about things, and they have the ability to leave a mark on your memory that burns long after you left the theatre or turned off your television set. 'The Godfather' is one of those life-changing motion pictures. Directed by film legend Francis Ford Coppola ('The Godfather' Trilogy, Apocalypse Now'), this movie is impossible to summarize in way that does justice to the benchmarks it set for American cinema and cinema worldwide. Its influence on the filming industry and the impact it has had on popular culture is simply massive. It has some of the most quotable lines in all of cinema and some of the most memorable scenes ever shot. Truly, there is, and never will be, anything quite like it. As funny and exciting as it is dark and brooding, 'The Godfather' is as close to flawless as any film has gets. The core of its strength lies in the writing, and in the character analysis of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and the tragic arc of his son, Michael (Al Pacino). Brando, in unquestionably is most famous role among a lifetime of legendary performances ('A Streetcar Named Desire, 'Last Tango in Paris,' 'On the Waterfront,' 'Apocalypse Now'), is a towering figure in this film. His character is extremely versatile, capable of being ruthless, intimidating, and powerful, while also showing vulnerability and compassion. He is unquestionably the face of this movie, and has its most famous lines. As for Al Pacino's character, Michael Corleone, he is the protagonist that guides the audience through the story and it is his ark that the viewers feel and experience. And man, what an arc it is. There are very few character transformations more emotional and effective than Pacino's in this movie. It is a tragic story, a moral downfall if you will, and Pacino plays it with such precision. His change from a likable, innocent everyman into a ruthless tyrant eerily similar to his old man is one of the most haunting and memorable in cinema. This film is also a launching point for the careers of many now famous actors, further highlighting 'The Godfather's excellent cast, including Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton. All deliver fantastic performances. Beyond the cast and writing (courtesy of Coppola and Mario Puzo, author of the book on which the film is based), the direction is a winner as well. Coppola really knows how to shoot scenes that emphasis tension and suspense. Most scenes have subtle storylines in and of themselves, and the consistent mood they establish as a whole serves to keep the themes of family allegiance and the moral consequences of serving in the mobster underworld alive and brutally close to the audience's heart. Coppola does an admirable job of sustaining this tone from beginning to climax. Another thing he and Puzo do well is pace the violence with the character development. They are intricately and effectively intertwined so that brutal, captivating violence is all the more meaningful and the characters' evolution is more interesting, exciting, and engrossing. Instead of character development and arcs being at odds with the action, here in 'The Godfather,' they act to work together and build on each other. Like they should. 'The Godfather' is a perfect example of appropriate pacing of excitement with relaxation and character enrichment with setpieces and hallmark climaxes. All in all, this gangster classic is, well, much more than a gangster classic. It was and still is a trendsetter for American cinema and will forever be a benchmark for all the characteristics that make up a great film. It is arguably the most influential movie ever made, both at home and abroad. It is for these reasons that I consider 'The Godfather' the greatest movie ever made. Or, as Ricky Bobby would put it, ""Best movie ever made."" If there was an intergalactic film competition that showcased the best motion pictures from every planet in the universe, 'The Godfather' is the film that I would choose to represent the cinema of humanity. It's that good. So, sit down and spend some time with the Corleone family this weekend. It will be a weekend you won't forget. If you only see one movie in your life, this one should be it. There are films, and then there are motion picture experiences. Experience 'The Godfather.' Let the Don make you an offer you can't refuse.",positive

"Most of my colleages would agree that Godfather II is a considerably complete film, with a more fitting ending, but I still believe The Godfather was one of the classics of the early 70's where we were spoiled for choice.

what a great and cool movie!!!,positive
"The Godfather is definitely a landmark movie in the history of cinema. It introduced the ""gangster genre"" that has become popular worldwide. Unlike the action movies of the time, it established itself as being a powerful character drama set in the crime world. More than just guys shooting each other, this was an intense tale of psychological manipulations. The movie served as a commentary of the post-WW2 America aand the delicate balance between business, politics and crime. In the middle of this was the Corleone family, decidedly grey characters. For them, family and friendships form one motivation, while power and wealth form the other side. Coppola's direction is definitely one of the stand-outs of the movie. The cinematography is excellent. Use of lighting and shadows to highlight the mafia characters gave it a noir-ish feel. The intercutting scenes, the ""special effects"" of glass shattering, bullets firing, the shot of a field when someone is getting killed, the kissing of the hand, the dialogues -- all contribute in making the movie memorable. Marlon Brando is simply phenomenal in the role of the patriarch Vito Corleone. Even though, there are many good performances -- notable mention being those of Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan -- none come close to matching the stature and complexity that Brando brings to his role, atleast in this movie. Al Pacino probably gets a chance to shine in the sequel. The soundtrack is just another feather in the cap. I believe there were quite a number of composers for the movie. My favorite would have to be the ""love theme"". It brings out the Italian flavor, and at the same time, there's a melancholic feel to the music. I didn't quite like how the women apparently had no personality at all. Kay's change of heart towards Michael is not explained at all. I understand it's probably speaks about the time period they were in (the 1940s), but C'MON, I'm sure it wouldn't have hurt to show their points-of-view too. It does ruin an otherwise great movie for me.",positive
Great Mafia movie ever,positive
The Greatest American Film Ever Made. I will only even discuss Citizen Kane as a possible contender (or Pulp Fiction). Say any other movie and prepare for a rant of epic proportions.,positive

"Another one of my all time favorites,this has the best actors in one film,Brando,Pacino,Duvall,Caan.Excellent in every way.Pathed the road to films about the mafia.Coppla's break thru directing.You love this family!!",positive
"The ultimate movie about the Mafia, focuses on family issues as Vito Corleone has built up an empire of trust and certain balance. Still through the events of the film it shown to be a very fragile balance which is needing of a strong leader with neither too much rage or tepidness. The story begins at the wedding of his daughter. He is mostly back in the house meeting members of the family either swearing allegiance or asking for favors. Vito handles it all with fantastic grace that sets a tone that he is thought so highly of throughout the film and when he leaves a void with his near death from shots in the street it is understood just what it means to come into the family business and run it all. At first the eldest son, Sonny, played like a lightning rod by James Caan, takes the reins, but he is quite unsuccessful as he is too head strong rushing into things including a gruesome demise. It then falls to the youngest son, Michael Corleone, who is played by a young Al Pacino, who at first seems tepid, but throughout the course of the film shows an extreme growth to become in the mold of Vito through pain and excitement. What makes this film standout amongst others of its kind of pulp fiction like is the fact that it has such an outrageously great cast. They are fuelled by the leader Marlon Brando to turn out the best performances they could possibly do, this stands especially true of Al Pacino and James Caan whom never really matched their greatness in this film save Pacino in the second film in which he got to delve deeper in to the darkness. This is one of the ultimate crime sagas ever created and well deserving of its love.",positive

"Please note, if you have not seen The Godfather and you are completely unaware of the premise of the movie, please be advised this review may contain some spoilers. It really is no surprise that The Godfather is such a favorite amongst film fans. As far as movies go, The Godfather is as close to flawless as it would seem any film could ever come. Unless the subject matter doesn't interest you, The Godfather will mostly certainly entertain. There are so many aspects of The Godfather that could be explored through the written word. What I want to focus on are two main areas. One, the timelessness of The Godfather as a film and two, the way in which it depicts the transformation of Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) and some of the themes touched on by that transformation. The Godfather really does come across as timeless. Despite being released over three and a half decades ago it feels like an entirely modern movie. It comfortably falls in the category of being ahead of its time. It is unique when a film not only becomes considered the quintessential film for a particular subject, in this case the mafia and crime families, but also continues to hold that title. Despite some competition in the decades preceding its release and some decades since its release it still is considered the ultimate gangster movie. Part of what I think audiences enjoy is the mix of family values and the horror and violence found in the world of 1940s and 50s gangsters. Here is a family that epitomizes togetherness, loyalty to one another, and unity, yet those values are juxtaposed with a family business involved with vice, violence, greed, corruption, and a lust for power, and control. The Godfather's depiction of the mafia continue to have impact even today and the ability the film has in producing sympathy in its audience for characters who when boiled down are quite frankly despicable is impressive. The most outstanding aspect of The Godfather, at least as I watched it just recently, was the way in which it depicts Michael Corleone as played by Al Pacino. Few movies are able to seamlessly span a long period of time and in the meantime depict the utter transformation of a character better than The Godfather. When the film begins Michael Corleone is found at the wedding of his sister. He is a war hero. He is a veteran. He is there with his sweetheart. He is outside the family business and there is no family pressure for him to return. We learn early on in the film that his father, played by Marlon Brando, is proud of his son. There is no indication of a desire on Michael's part or his father for Michael to be involved. In fact, Michael Corleone is quoted as saying, ""That's my family Kay, that's not me."" Yet through the unity and loyalty to his family mentioned above, this character slowly starts to make a 180. His family, is soon faced with extreme adversity and Michael Corleone believably begins to change, putting the loyalty to his family not only above the law but morality in general. The believability of this kind of complete and utter transformation is the type of transformation so many other movies try to depict but fail at. As silly as it may sound I can't help but think of Darth Vader and the transformation Anakin Skywalker makes into one of the best known villains in cinema. Despite having three movies at his disposal the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader isn't nearly as believable or flawlessly executed as the transformation in just one movie of Michael Corleone in The Godfather. Not only does he completely and utterly change, but the audience sympathizes finding themselves in his shoes and wondering if they wouldn't make such irreversible and drastic changes in there own morality and course of life if placed in the same situation. While the change seems gradual and believable the scene that perhaps best demonstrates Michael Corleone's transformation is the scene in the restaurant with Captain McCluskey after Michael Corleone fetches a gun from the bathroom. From that point on there is no turning back. Michael Corleone's initially hesitant acceptance of a somber, irreversible, and violent change in his life soon transforms into completely embracing it wholeheartedly. One marvels at the complexity of character tackled by the filmmakers in the character of Michael Corleone. Ironically, you can't help but feel that is was not only love for his family but maybe even his commitment to duty, likely learned in the military, that helps facilitate this complete change in Michael Corleone. The Godfather belongs on the short list of movies containing the ultimate character studies on some of the most fascinating characters. Some could argue that Michael Corleone is a victim really of the line of business his father chose to be involved with. It is perhaps his sense of duty, his loyalty to his family and almost a sense of inevitability that finds him abandoning morality. The irony of this depiction is part of what makes The Godfather a powerful film. Michael Corleone's strength of character ultimately leads to the abandonment of morality and the embracing of the most satanic of lifestyles. Near the end of the movie as we witness Michael Corleone in the church the filmmaker makes this transformation clear and clearly draws parallels between his character and the the most infamous character of all, the devil himself. The fact that immoral choices made by Michael's father lead to his downfall, reminds me of the Biblical concept of the sins of the father being visited on the heads of the children also. There is certainly a statement made between the lines of this movie that one cannot make life choices in a vacuum and all that we do in life will effect those around us either adversely or positively. The Godfather happens to be a very powerful example of that as Michael's father basically dooms Michael to a life of crime and violence based on his actions, no matter how unaware and unplanned that result happens to be for Michael's father. You get a sense in fact that he deeply regrets living to see Michael's involvement in the family business. As I have said before The Godfather is one of the most fascinating character studies ever released on film. Much can be written and much has been written on The Godfather. I could go on, but my hope is that this review will spark some interest and hopefully give the reader of it some food for thought, perhaps resulting in seeing some new virtues and peeling away at some of the layers of complexity and impact this film possesses.",positive

"C'est Ã©norme... Une haute densitÃ© dans la tension, mÃªme les pauses sont importantes. On peut voir le coup venir, cela n'en reste pas moins stressant.

The movie to end all movies. What is there to say? A very good translation of Puzo's classic. Coppola's film has become a classic in itself with memorable performances from Pacino and Brando. This film will never sleep with the fishes.,positive

Godfather and Godfather 2 are the only film and it's sequel to have won the Oscar for Best Picture - proves everyones point that these are amongst the greatest films and stories ever told.,positive

Just watch the movies and sum up yourself. No words can describe the greatness of this movie,positive

"By far, one of the greatest movies of all time. Awards could've gone to actor in this film. The directing was great. Francis For Coppola is one of the best film makers out there! Everything about this movie was amazing! There was one thing that bothered me about it, though. There's a scene where they show a nude woman and it is absolutely pointless and is like 15 seconds of the movie and has nothing to do with and has nothing to offer the movie! Other than that, this movie was great and is one of my favorites of all time!",positive

The Best Movie I've Ever Seen...,positive
"well, not my favorite though",positive
"There's little I can say that hasn't been said ten million times before. Great story, characters and acting. So many personalities and drama, so little time, even at nearly three hours! The story of the Corleone's is simply the best, most developed and engrossing mafia tale ever commited to film, a fact that's obvious even here in what is only the first (and in my opinion best) of three parts. A little heavy going, you really have to be in the mood, but if you are you will be well rewarded.",positive
"Truly a classic, this embodies the passion and intensity of the Mafia. The story may be violent but it's beautiful. Hands down to Al Pacino... and Francis Ford Coppla!",positive
"What a classic, the movie will be TIMELESS FOREVER!! Marlon Brando was flawless and Al Pacino was the man!! ""I'm gonna make him an offer he cant refuse.""",positive
One of the best films ever made.,positive
"One of the best films ever. The direction was great by Coppola and the screenplay by Coppola and Puzo was amazing. The acting by the whole cast with the likes of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Cazale, Keaton, and Shire was amazing and was one the best of performances by them in their careers. Brando himself put up one of the greatest performances by an actor ever.",positive

ufffffffffff.. peliculon,positive
"Marlon Brando's master piece! You miss it, you know nothing of movies. --- mAdAh",positive
Eh... I can see why people love this movie. I did like it but it's not the best movie I've ever seen. It's good. I just hated everyone in the movie except Diane Keaton and Marlon Brando. I was really mad that Al Pacino's character became a stupid jerk in the second half of the movie. Seriously. He took over and got mean. Besides that it was a good movie. I guess you could even say it was a great movie but I just hated the characters. If I hadn't I might have really loved it.,positive
the film that set the bench mark for the subsequent gangster genre- brilliant in every possible way,positive
I dont wat it is about this movie but it just seems so real everything about this movie perfect acting perfect everything. I wish is for a movie to out do this movie i believe it can be done but it is going to need a miracle movie really. coz this is the best,positive
Perfect cast? I think so. This movie continues to get better and better every time I watch it. Even better - read the book then go back and watch the movie. There is a lot of background revealed in the book that adds more to the movie experience.,positive

"What can you say? Considered by most to be one of the greatest American films ever made, I slightly prefer Two, probably without a doubt the best American acting displayed in one film with so many iconic moments that there really isn't much to argue when considering it.

I know I'm a guy and a fan of the Godfather. So cliche. But anyone who knows anything about movies knows this is basically the first mob movie where Italians actually play Mafioso. Too many great lines to go over. Let's just say that Brando was a true national treasure and so is Pacino.,positive
The ultimate movie. It really has everything. Just watch.,positive
"Ya it shows the truth in a pretty real world of the mofia! It was long but totally a classic, and a must see to put in your collection!",positive
"""I'm not dumb, not like everyone says"" Fredo",positive
EVERYTIME I TRY TO PICK SOMETHING ELSE..IT PULLS ME RIGHT BACK!,positive
"On my Top 10 of All-Time. The greatest crime-drama ever made. Watching the transformation of Michael Corleone is one of the greatest viewing experiences ever. Let's face it, the film is iconic. The ""Horse Head Scene"" and the ""Deadly Oranges"" are cinematic gold. Don't agree? Then you'll be sleepin' with the fishes.",positive
Finally decided to watch this after not having enough time in my schedule to do so. Such a fantastic movie!!!!,positive
"a legendary cult classic...it is not just a mafia movie...it is a movie of family values...voted #1 movie of all time on imdb.com which is completely justified...no other movie can ever surpass it...every scene is an acting and direction lesson...it is so beautiful tht u just wish to be born in tht family and in tht era...frm marlon brando to john cazale...every character is given equal importance...not to mention our gr8 mr pacino who was lucky to get this movie amongst all the famous actors of tht time...it was cut throat competition for michael corleone's role which pacino got coz of mr coppola's persistence...but what a correct decision...ther cannot be a better michael corleone than wat pacino played...every frame is like a piece of art...engrossing story...and excellent acting by everyone...and the icing on the cake...its music by nino rota...so beautiful...so scicilian...watch it and listen to brando saying tht famous line...""i'll make him an offer he can't refuse""...this is a movie which u just can't refuse...",positive
One of the longest and best movies i have ever seen. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are some of the best actors ever.,positive
"its nt possible 2put all tha stars i wd lyk. this is the gr8est film of all time, even the sequels, these r unbeatable an have made all the actors involved in2 legends",positive
"I felt so bad for not having seen this, but now after I have, it's easy to see why people love it so much. The acting is superb, and the screenplay and cinematography were excellent. Coppola really knew what he was doing. Lots of people I've met said it was slow, but I disagree entirely. The character development and build up to action creates and amazing tension. Watching Pacino's character rise to his power is thrilling to watch, and I can't wait to watch Part II.",positive
Amazing to say the least.,positive
A classic movie. Great story.,positive
"Masterpiece of a plot, and pure acting genius.",positive
one of the two greatest movie ever made,positive
The BEST movie ever made!,positive
Fantastic film. The last scene with the office door closing gives chills.,positive
the best movie ever..,positive
"Taitaa olla se maailman paras elokuva. there wasn't enough time, Michael. There just wasn't enough time.",positive
"This is an amazing film. I like Part 2 better, and Part 3 better than that. The best trilogy there is, in my opinion.",positive
Epic movie. Perhaps only a one-timer if your not into the genre but at least once in your life.,positive
The classic best movie ever,positive
"Words really cannot describe how fantastic this movie is. Great performances all around (I think Robert Duvall gets overlooked sometimes), the ending is one of the best in film history.",positive
nada se compara .... con esta pelicula es realmente una obra maestra...,positive
"""Tattaglia was a pimp. He could have never outfought Santino. But wasn't til this day, I knew it was Barzini all along"". What else is there to say?",positive
"Somehow I grew up in the 70's without ever watching this movie. As I watched, I realised I have seen it disseminated in the many pictures that quote it.",positive
Well acted and mostly interesting. However it was a little too slow moving for me with parts that seemed to not really have a point to them.,negative
"Brilliant movie - a total classic. A film I watch over again as often as I can. One of my favorite films, and certainly my favourite of the three!",positive
this is one of those sacred cows that i can't stand. the movie has no real emotional impact for me.,negative
One of the best movies of all time (if it's your kind of movie).,positive
Revu en DVD! Un chef d'oeuvre!!!,positive
A Masterpiece movie!!!!,positive
The first has always been my favorite.,positive
Mejor peli del mundo.,positive
"What can i say, possibly most perfect film ever",positive
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse....haha...I love that line:),negative
"Perhaps filmaking at its most sublime, this film is perhaps a perfect excercise in moviemaking. It functions as both tremendous entertainment, powerful drama and intellectual stimulation. A strong sense of catholocism dominates the film and informs its morals, but Coppola keeps it restrained allowing for a few moments of tremendous cinematic power. He is helped by a great script (co-written by the original author) that is long, but never feels like anything less than a thrill ride with some needed moments to catch one's breath. The cast is universally excellent, with Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall standing out as supporting highlights. But it is really Pacino's profound and profoundly moving performance that anchors the movie. Crime motives aside, the film is truly the story of Michael Corleone, and Pacino inhabits the character with true thespian brilliance. The film is greatly helped by a terrific score which is wonderfully integrated and ecclectic. A masterpiece in every way.",positive
"Just Awsome, simply the best movies i have ever watched.",positive
possibly the best movie ever made..,positive
come on seriously if you have not seen this movie go hang yourself =),positive
A classic. Loves it.,positive
"the greatest movie ever period if you beg to differ, then i dont care for you as a person if i tell you to go see it, then that would be an offer you can't refuse",positive
The GREATEST movie ever.,positive
I just can't believe Marlon Brando had to die.,positive
This is the kind of movie God would make if he wasn't such an invisible prick.,positive
"Epic, awesome plot, superb acting.. especially pre coke riddled pacino. hard not to love a film thats influenced at least every gangster film since.",positive
God this movie is a classic mob hit. I've seen this movie so many times and it never gets out.,positive
"i think it's funny how you guys are putting up ""4 1/2 stars or 4 stars"". what spectacular movie are you saving the 5 star rating for?",positive
"One of the all-time classic films. Francis Ford Coppola took a bloody gangster melodrama and turned it into an operatic masterpiece. And it's still quite bloody, at least it was for its time. And to think that the producer, Robert Evans hated Coppola's masterful version! Still truly one of the greatest films ever made.",positive
I can't believe I am marrying someone who has not seen this movie.,positive
"As good as they say it is. Every little thing about it is perfect. Every performance, every technical decision.",positive
Top Notch! Makes me want to be a mob boss!,positive
Had the Godfather Marathon at Levis best movie day ever,positive
"Glorious, overrated mediocrity. The scene with the christening and the assassinations and the organ was the only part worth seeing.",negative
One of the greatest movies of all-time. To think the producers didn't like Al Pacino.,positive
"Splendid Performances by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino n Robert Duvall",positive
Great movie with great actors,positive
A Classic.Great Acting all around,positive
"A classic, even if it insists upon itself (to quote Family Guy).",positive
Could this film be any better? Truly a near-perfect depiction of the Mafia (not that I'm in anyway involved). :S,positive
This is the greatest movie of all time!,positive
The whole trilogy is fantastic....,positive
Best movie ever made on Mafia!,positive
"Not much to say about this movie. If you haven't seen it, you need to wake up.",positive
"Easily one of the best American films ever made. The acting, story, directing, and cinematography are all perfect. ""The Godfather"" is truly a cinematic masterpiece.",positive
"THE GODFATHER is a Magnum Opus , nothing short of a Master Piece . Its a Staggering Triumph ... The definitive story about a sinister fraternity of Crime.",positive
"This was a very compelling movie, had me glued to my chair until the end. THE classic gangster movie, more so than Goodfellas.",positive
"The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime ""family"" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid 1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in a tremendous, award-winning acting portrayal that revived his career). A turn-of-the-century Silician immigrant, he is the head of one of the five Italian-American ""families"" that operates a crime syndicate. The 'honorable' crime ""family,"" working outside the system due to exclusion by social prejudice, serves as a metaphor for the way business (the pursuit of the American dream) is conducted in capitalistic, profit-making corporations and governmental circles. This epic story traces the history of their close-knit Mafia family and organization over a ten year period (although the specific words ""Mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" are not found in the film's script - they were replaced with ""the family""). The presiding, dominant Corleone patriarch, who is threatened by the rise of modern criminal activities - the drug trade, is ultimately succeeded by his decent youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a US Marine Corps officer in WWII who becomes even more ruthless to persist. Family loyalty and blood ties are juxtaposed with brutal and vengeful blood-letting and the inevitable downfall of the family. Romanticized scenes of the domestic home life of members of the family - a family wedding, shopping, a baptism, kitchen cooking, etc., are intertwined with scenes of horrific violence and murder contracts - a total of 23 deaths litter the film. Over 50 scenes involved food and drink.",positive
Greatest mob movie of all time! All the actors did awesomely good. One of my favourites. Really outstanding.,positive
Excellent movie. The best out of the trilogy.,positive
"marlon brabdo, u r my hero",positive

the daddy of all gangster films!,positive
Im gonna make him an offer he cant refuse,positive
Take it to the mattresses my friends.,positive
Best movie of all time.,positive
"I've avoided seeing this movie a long time and now I don't understand why I did. One of the best movies ever made, and I never knew Al Pacino could act so well after seeing him in so many bad movies shouting his head off.",positive
"All time best. Best director together with best actor and the next two best actors , made the best movie fill it with the best music theme ever.",positive
film for the gangsters lol.,positive
But the book is better I think,positive
The Best of all time.,positive

Excellent Movie-Must watch. Brando live up to the expectation of a Mafia Don,positive
It doesn't get any better than this.,positive
Top three movies of all time. Nothing else can be said that hasn't already,positive
"The greatest film ever made, in my humble opinion.",positive
A 5* film Nicely transformed from Novel into a classic epic. Well performed characters portrayed by Marlon Brando and unimitable style of Al Pacino made this film being rated as best of all time movies My verdict : A must watch film,positive
"Ga ngebosenin,padahal film lama",positive
"Very rich storytelling. The characters were so engaging - especially Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's - and although I found some of the plot hard to follow, as a whole this is an outstanding piece of cinema.",positive
Best movie ever made!,positive
the best mob movie ever made,positive
Great movie perfection from the book !,positive
"One of the best movies of all time, including some of the best performances by Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino",positive
A relaxing watch. Makes you think you are in the story.,positive
My all-time favorite movie with Part II and GoodFellas,positive
there is sth special. it is not surprised to be seen as CLASSIC.,positive
"I finally saw this movie after so long! One of the greatest movies of all time; some say it's the greatest. Definitely one of my favourite movies; tied for first place (The Shawshank Redemption). Awesome classic that has paved the way for other gangster/mafia movies that followed. I can't find a single thing that's wrong about this movie. Sure it's long (one of the longest movies I've seen); but it's got a good solid script/plot with awesome acting [fantastic acting by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino (he looked so different back then) and James Caan in particular], amazing screenplay, haunting (in a good way) soundtrack, and great direction. Good job Francis F. Coppola! AWESOME!",positive
"What else can I say that others haven't already? Cinematic perfection,",positive
"Great atmosphere and it is very well made, but still i think it is a little bit overrated. Coppola makes an great use of light, colour and music. But this is far from his best works.",negative
"I think the end of this movie is heartbreaking, but I know people who find it weirdly inconclusive. I think maybe it speaks more strongly to men and people with fucked up family issues.",positive
Love this fucking movie!,positive
One of the best films ever made,positive
One of the most influential movies of our time. very dark and thought provoking movie.,positive
A Master Piece!!! The Gansgster movie!!!,positive
"The more I see it, the more I like it...",positive
"Classic. In every way. Amazing cinematography, acting, realism. The Italian historical significance still is what formed much of what the US is today...",positive
"Francis Ford Coppola brings to life a literary masterpiece. This film is a superb combination of scripting, acting, cinematography,direction. Awesome performances add to the magic..especially Brando and Pacino who are without a doubt the greatest actors of all times and GODFATHER is one of the greatest movies ever made....",positive
The greatest of all American-made films.,positive
"One of the best American movies ever made, this epic story follows the Corleone mob family in the 1940s. This movie contains many of the most quoted scenes in movie history and has an all-star cast lead by the fantastic Marlon Brando, who really deserved his Oscar for his portrayal of Don Corleone.",positive
"all-time classic, a classy portrayal of cosa nostra's habits, conflicts and actions. and, ofc, al pacino's and marlon brando's performances are chillingly convincing...",positive
Damn good movie!It goes at its own pace but is very true to the novel.,positive
"The only three hour movie that will have your constant attention...the acting is second to none. One of the best, if not the best, movies that I have ever seen.",positive
this movie has mesmerized me!,positive
most mazin movie ever!,positive
top 5 film on any list of all time classics.,positive
Yet another example of one of the greatest movies ever.,positive
No doubt the Godfather is the best movie ever made.,positive
one movie which still stands the tests of time.,positive
A classic that will stand the test of time,positive
best mafia movie ever,positive
This movie is perfect I can't say anything bad about this film. At All. Mr Marlon Brando gives very dramatic performance as the lead role.,positive
how good was this - the second one not too bad either especially the flash backs but the third was crap - Im gonna make him an offer he cannae refuse - class!!!!,positive
it's the godfather. nuff said,positive
"Number 3 film, the acting is just sensational in this crime infused flick.",positive
loved james caan gettin chumped and the revenge that ensued.,negative
"Um... What can you say. Coppola is a genius. I read something that Spelburg said. ""I have never made a movie as good as the Godfather and don't have the ambition to try.""",positive
"Pacino, Brando, Duvall, Coppola. The Godfather. Need I say more? A masterpiece and a big part of Americana.",positive
Defintley the greatest movie of all time. Please try my godfather quiz.. http://apps.facebook.com/flixster/u/820559300/quizzes,positive
"i dunno why it took me so long to see, awesome, it was worth the wait",positive
I can't believe Peter Griffin did not care for this.,positive
"Complex history, nice speechs with great rhythm. Good the first time, nicer the second!",positive
The Godfather Triology should unseat Citizen Kane as the best in American film making.,positive
A great big load of boring,negative
Not may movies live up to the books they come from but this wasnt far away fantastic movie,positive
great film. best of the 3.,positive
"No guns to my head needed here, a great film!",positive
"Cult movie.....marlon brando ,al pacino have solid screen presense....superb dialogue delivery...amazing screenplay....3 hrs of pure cinematic xperience which no oder movie can match",positive
the best of the best,positive
bring on the sopranos,positive
Possibly one of the very few movies that hollywood ever churned out that was faithful to the original literary work. Amazing histrionics by Brando & Pacino. Small wonder it is rated an alltime great,positive
Perfection made movie.,positive
THE EVER CLASSIC!!! THE EVER BEST!!! THE EVER MY FAV!!!,positive
ANOTHER ALL TIME FAVORITE GANGSTA MOVIE,positive
A Movie You Can't Refuse,positive
a very intense movie n its also fascinating...,positive
"The greatest film of all-time? Some say this one is, some say part II....But oir me, Marlon Brando is absolutely spectacular in this film, with Al Pacino and James Caan coming a very close second and third. I've wanted to watch this fantasically rated film for years and I finally got to watch it without expense....lol. The plot got me a little confused early on...but then I just enjoyed the scenes and atmosphere of the leads. I agree that the story of the 'prodigal son' eventually turning out to be like his own father is a great archetype. I'll make you an offer you can't refuse....If you like your epics, bring a cushion....you'll love it.",positive
"Leave the gun, take the cannoli",positive
Great movie a must see !!!,positive
greatest movie ever!!!!,positive
What's with guys and the godfather?,negative
"A really good movie, but definitely over-hyped. I don't usually mind really long movies, but there just wasn't enough excitement going on. I think the thing that makes this movie hard to really appreciate is that the main character, Michael, isn't that likable. He goes from being boring to kinda ruthless. It definitely is a classic though, and I would say that everyone should see it, just so they can form their own opinion.",positive
"The greatest film of all-time. Marlon Brando is absolutely spectacular in this film, Al Pacino is amazing and the directing of this fim is stunning.",positive
Simplesmente perfeito.,positive
this is a awsome movie,positive
Marlon Brando's best role ever.,positive
"watched every square inch of every frame of the movie but, and even now i dont get bored 2 watch again",positive
All time classic never get tired of watching this one.,positive
"Not overtly brutal, just believable. Not too boring, but steadily paced. Not too dramatic, but evoking.",positive
awsome!!!!!!!!....simplyyy amazingg!!!!!!!!!,positive
An actor's book of reference. An all time favourite.,positive
is there anything better than this...,positive
The Greatest Movie ever made,positive
Awesome! The basis for gangster movies.,positive
"err...Al Pacino looked graceful when he was young sooo unlike the dope he is now,thank you very much",positive
Must see very long but Very Good !,positive
EXcellent Ã  voir et Ã  revoir ! Toujours dans ma vidÃ©othÃ¨que ... vieilles cassettes VHS ;o),positive
One of the greatest movies of all time,positive
Its the mother trucking godfather. Thats all you need to say.,positive
"Once in your lifetime is probably enough but, of course, it is a masterpiece. Let's give credit where credit is due.",positive
the best gangsta movie ever,positive
Absolute collossus of a film....nuff said,positive
Its a really good movie...,positive
i dont know what is so compelling about this movie but i watched it and was enthralled...as soon as i finished i watched the second one an i am currently in the middle of the third one...all within three days...i dont know why but i am compelled to watch all three as quickly as i can...all this to say i think that they are quite good,positive
"Even in it's 3 hour run time, there is never a red flag. A brilliant work of art that has stood out in front or beside the many other classic movies of all time.",positive
"Spend an entire day and watch this one and the sequel...and then come back and tell me that Scarface is a great movie! This film and its sequel define the genre. No film captures the era better, and no one plays a better Don than Al Pacino. This is the Al before he started to scream and overact.",positive
My father is from Bagheria sicily so I feel a kinship with this movie.,positive
"I love it, but I still think that The Godfather Pt. II is better.",positive
easily the greatest mafia movie ever made,positive
it's just a classic..what else to say??,positive
I so need to see this again.,positive
Marlon Brando? i'm so speechless..,positive
Genius. Nothing more needs to be said.,positive
This movie makes me proud to be 25% Italian.,positive
It was okay. It wasnt great but i liked it.,positive
i can never describe how complete this movie realy is.everyone`s actings is just perfect.the music is inspiring.the directing is something beyond imagination and the photography is immortal,positive
An offer you can't refuse...flawless,positive
Arguably one of the best movies in history.,positive
"Klasika, brez razlage:)",positive
Can't go wrong with it,positive
"What can I say about this classic film that hasn't already been said by someone else? First off, Godfather I & 2 should be watched together but don't bother with 3 because its lame. The wedding party scene for me is one of my favorites because of how real it felt. Some of the rules laid out in this film, such as never discuss anything outside of the family, has become commandments for some fans.",positive
"takes me a while to get used to the accents, especially the godfather's , so i had a hard time understanding what they're saying for some of the movie. maybe i'll watch it again with subtitles. it seemed pretty good though. diane keaton looked so young! i couldn't tell it was her until like halfway through the movie.",positive
NOT A MOVIE. THIS IS A FILM,positive
"Una pelÃ­cula que trasciende de generaciÃ³n en generaciÃ³n. Una pelÃ­cula cruda que exalta al mas alto nivel los valores de un circulo familiar, donde el HONOR y la LEALTAD valen mas que el mismo Dinero. Las actuaciones de cada uno de los actores hace al Padrino una pelÃ­cula llena de personajes intensos y coloridos que dejan el deseo de saber mas de la historia. Se rumoraba que El Padrino enseÃ±a aspectos fundamentalmente ligados con la creaciÃ³n, caÃ­da y redenciÃ³n del hombre. Buenisima. Altamente Recomendada",positive
"Coppola is such a great director. This film is solid gold, a powerful cinematic epic that defines the transition of power between father and son. Viewed in the context of faithfulness to the source material, this film is exacting. Viewed in the context of original art form, this film also scores high, especially when put into place with the rest of the film saga, which offered a very interesting story that followed the rise and fall of Vito Corleone and the resistance, rise to power, ultimate corruption, and final redemption of his son Michael. Truly a great film, and a great film saga. I don't think any other Mafia film comes close.",positive
"""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" - it can't get any better than that!!!",positive
"What a great classic - it's still a great movie despite all of the copies, parodies and take offs",positive
Marlon Brando and the cast of characters in this movie are great. Great and intense story about a mob family and how they fought to keep their organization together. A worthy Oscar winner and one of the best movies of all time!,positive
I was starting to wonder if the Flixster people had heard of this film.,positive
"I am continually amazed by the normalness of Don Corleone. He was not flashy, driving around in Cadillacs and such. I remember being so disappointed Michael stepped into the dirty family business, but now I can see why he wanted to protect and defend his family. Okay, so his business was illegal, and he did murder his brother in law. I loved the part when he broke the rule to let his wife (Diane Keaton) ask about the business, and he lies so convincingly to her. She knows it too, in the next scene. Ofcourse, the epitome of drama was the Baptism, renouncing satan and evil, all the while murder being committed. A bit anti-catholic, eh?? I was so ready to watch some adult drama. Can't wait for II!",positive
"""Classic"" in every sense of the word. A movie I never get tired of watching!",positive
"nadie es brando, ni nadie es francis ford Copola, nadie vuelve a hacer lo que hicieron en esta pelicula.... maestralmente unica",positive
Obra maestra que no pasa de epoca,positive

My favorite movie of ALL TIME!!! Classic!!,positive
"The 2nd best movie of all time (after Godfather 2). superb story and acting, a timeless classic.",positive
It is simply the BEST movie ever made,positive
"Top ten fave. The camera moves along quietly with this great music score, seeming to savor the recreation of a bygone era, when wham! Violence erupts. Skillfully wrought and subtly lit. Beautiful piece of film making. Fave line: ""Leave the gun. Take the canolli.""",positive
The standard by which all organized crime movies are measured. An American classic and masterpiece from Coppola.,positive
I LOVE THIS FILM. I blame it for my continued love of Mafia stories (although the film version of Puzo's 'The Sicilian' made me want to cry). Definitely one of the best endings in film too.,positive
Lo mejor de Marlon Brando,positive
Huge scope - brings you into a new world. Holds up well.,positive
A classic is all I have to say.,positive
how can anyone not love the godfather?,positive
best movie ever made,positive
Absolutely the best movie ever made,positive
"Gets an extra star since the director went to my film school, but really, this movie is vastly overrated.",positive
"Pretty much the pinnacle of outstanding movie-making. I found every scene to be necessary and brilliant, even with its 3 hour running time. Marlon Brando led an all-star cast in this epic gangster drama. (and definitely a great start for the brilliant Al Pacino!) BEST SCENE: Horse head in bed, 'nuff said.",positive
"I just watched this again after probably 2 years, and I forgot how good it is. One of my all time favorites.",positive
"I can see why Marlon Brando won an Academy Award for his performance as Vito Corleone. This movie is very good and surprisingly interesting, but it is way too long. I'd recommend it for Brando's performance alone.",positive
how can you not give this a go,negative
The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.,positive
wonderful piece of art. all my boyfriends and male members of my families talked about this but i never knew what they were talking about. now i know and it is a great piece.,positive
"The first and if not for its sequel, the best of the Hollywood Mafia films. This is quite simply one of the best films ever made. The plot is just fantastic and all of the leads are played brilliantly by their respective actors. This excellent tale of the slow corruption of the 'prodigal son' by his own family is one of the highlights of modern film making.",positive
This movie revolutionized the industry,positive
"If you have never seen this movie then fuck you, lol",positive
One of the best movies ever made.,positive
"I love you with all-a my heart! If I don't see you again soon, I'm a-gonna die!",positive

"By far one of the BEST classics ever made ... the whole Italian vibe, the superb acting .. the drama .. AH! sure worthy of an oscar!",positive
Great movie of all time!,positive
As an intrigued member of the mafia fan club I can be quite skeptical when it comes to Mafia based movies. This one however is the king of them all. based on the Mario Puzo novel it stands head and shoulder amongst others in this genre. The casting of Brando & Pacino were both masterstrokes although both in different ways.,positive
"OMFG, this movie no doubt is probaly in da Top 5 greatest movies ever made. The acting performances, the screen play itself, is just a freakin masterpiece. Though it is about gangster [ a topic I'm not very fond of] the story of da gangsters is told through this movie n an extraordinarily way. This is just a great movie from beginning to end.",positive
One of the best movies ever!,positive
BREATH MFN TAKING!! Las 3 del padrino no tienen abuelita!! Colosos del cine!,positive
The best gangster film I've ever seen.,positive

"Fantastic. Bested only slightly by II, but not because it is lacking in any way.",positive
What about the Godmother?,positive
"A great film that I'm glad I finally got around to seeing after years of saying I would! There is the wonderfully menacing presence of Brando, the complex character of Michael, played by Pacino and the epic ups and downs of the family, played out under the inspired direction of Ford Coppola. One of the strongest parts of the film is the gradual and irreversable change in Pacino's character; from the respected war veteran at the beginning to a less subtle version of his violent, all powerful father by the end. 2 scenes stuck out for me in showing this beautfully. Firstly a scene in which he is trying to muster up the conviction to shoot the person who has made an attempt on his father's life, the suspense echoed by the sound of an impending train. Secondly, near the end, the scene jumps between the christening of his own godson (and his own baptism) and the planned killing of all his foes by his design - showing the true extremes of his character and the depths of cold-hearted evil he has now reached. Great film, worth much of it's hype",positive
Golden Rule with trilogies: The 1st movie is almost always the best.,positive
"Marlon Brando puts everyone to shame! I can see why this tops the movie list still to this day. The entire movie feels very modern. Great, great great direction, effects, acting, scenery.. it's just the storyline I'm not crazy about. Either way, it's good stuff.",positive
best movie of all time,positive
quite possibly the best mob movie ever,positive
"It's a great film, no doubt, but I have no interest in gangsters, especially not these stupid blind thugs and their, tragically, even stupider women. It's well made, and I admire it for that, but it has very little to say that's of value to me.",positive
"Everyone loves The Godfather, and for good reason of course. Al pacino, Marlon Brando, especially Brando. People like the sequal better, but i say no way, no Brando...its not better. One of the greatest most recognizable performances of all time is Marlon Brando as The Godfather. Its violent, the dialogue is GOD, and its just made so perfectly. What else can you say?",positive
Unreasonably good movie about a reasonable man and his reasonable family!,positive
"i've seen it once, which is not enough",positive
Rated third best movie ever!,positive
So many great quotes How can u not like this film?,positive
A classic with a stellar cast.,positive
the best movie that i ever seen,positive
"classic movie, great acting, great story, great script!",positive
"Kokonaisuutena varsin hyva elokuva, muttei ylla kuitenkaan maineensa tasolle. Brandon ja Pacinon roolisuoritukset ovat hyvat, mutta jotkut henkilohahmoista jaavat valitettavan etaisiksi. Loppupuolella elokuvan tunnelma myos jotenkin latistuu.",negative
There is no film that can touch the greatness movie ever made so Mr Coppola and Puzo I salute you on this movie,positive
One of the greatest films ever,positive
one of the best movies ever made...period!,positive
"Marlon Brando looks exactly like my grandfather (RIP) this movie really takes me back to the old country, lol, ok, ive never been to Sicily, but my father was born n raised there, this movie represents the struggle of every Italian immigrant that came to America for a better life, my father made that journey so I wouldn't have to. Arivaderchi!",positive
Never go against the family...never.,negative
"One of the best movies ever made! Leave the gun, take the cannoli.",positive
"Not a huge mafia movie guy, but I still really enjoy this movie...I'm sure if I was around during the time it came out I would've been absolutely blown away, but I wasn't, thus the half star less.",positive
"All Time Best Movie, Ever!!",positive
"this is THE BEST FILM EVER MADE! Pacino, Brando and Caan...AWESOME PERFORMANCE",positive
"I defy anyone to provide a finer example of ensemble acting than The Godfather. From Brando's iconic Vito right down to undertaker Bonasera, every scene is oozing with atmosphere and every performance is pitch-perfect. No punches are pulled in showing the murkier side of mafia life, but it's beautifully played against the strong sense of honour and loyalty exhibited by the Corleone's. Diane Keaton manages to provide a surprisingly strong presence throughout, despite the naturallly male-heavy essence of the film. Career defining performances from all, and a beautifuly sweeping directorial style from Coppola. Essential.",positive
"The Best. Movie. Ever. Period. Brilliant performances by Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, et al. A tight, involving story of family. Coppola's directorial achievements here are only equaled by his work in The Godfather Part II. It is hands down the shortest three hour movie you will ever watch. What else is there to say that hasn't already been said by so many others? Required watching for anybody and everybody.",positive
"a brutal but wonderful story of the Corleone's in New York, it still moves me after all these years. the actors are brilliant. And mr Coppola is probably the ony one who could do that movie at that time. It's moving, it's sad and in the middle of it also a very happy movie, the famliy thats sticks together stays forever.",positive
"Very very good, but I'm knocking off half a star for the destruction of the lovely rare Alfa Romeo. Surely it could've been done with a mock-up, or off camera? Spoiled the whole film for me.",positive
Greatest Mob movie of All time,positive
well good mafia guys,positive
The best Mafia movie ever,positive
"Nice action, a dark atmosphere and great acting made this movie great. However the plot was very hard to follow at times.",positive
The final scene is simply chilling. Love it.,positive
"It's the best movie that has ever existed, should I say something else?",positive
Don't need to explain why we all like Godfather....anyone who doesn't is an outcast.,positive
Timeless Classic. If You havent Seen It WATCH IT!!!!,positive
"When I saw this film in high school, I had to sit through it twice -- there was so much to absorb. And a real gem among all the Brando / Pacino / Duvall / Keaton / Cazale work is the wonderful James Caan as Sonny.",positive
One of the best movies of all time!,positive
There is really nothing bad to say about this movie.The tension and the drama of the story builds and builds and delivers each time you watch it,positive
"i have to admit, i mainly love it for the young pacino...",positive
I do not like these sort of movies much,negative
Probabilmente uno dei migliori film di sempre,positive
"""The"" daddy of all the Mafiosos",positive
i may watch later. it's great series.,negative
Undeniably the BEST ever made,positive
The ultimate man's movie. Storytelling and cinema just cannot get better than this. Casting and performances near perfect!,positive
its caracters are very well played and seem to depict verywell the happenings in the mob you can also see that it is based on the history of mobsters in new york.,negative
"I hear there are people who say this movie is over rated. Those people should stop watching movies all together, in any case i suspect their intelligence equates to something similar as pond scum. This is a classic. Watch it. Don't argue.",positive
Best Movie everrrr u gota watch it,positive
well... there are no words to describe it. its the ultimate masterpiece in storytelling.,positive
I'll give you one guess what I thought of this...,positive
"I watched this years ago and didn't 'get it' -- this time 'round, I 'got it' and loved it. I understand why this is such a classic... especially considering it was made in '72.",positive
"Perhaps the most overrated piece of cinema ever to grace our screens. Not in any respect a terrible film, but The Godfather has a bigger bark than bite. Certainly Marlon Brando delivers the performance of the century as Don Corleone, but the film in itself isn't spectacular. Coppola's direction is garbled and repetitive, unlike his Apocalypse Now or The Conversation. His camerawork is dull, and even recent luminaries can work a camera better. It has changed American cinema, but so have other movies. It's left its footprint, and I respect it as an influential piece: without The Godfather, Martin Scorsese might have found a different path... It should be revered, and seen, but not necessarily enjoyed.",negative
ese rodr ps awebo el scarface era mas rifado haha,positive
Often called the best movie ever made. Easily the best crime film.,positive
"This is what the magic of movies are all about. Presentation of a world that is believable and engrossing, The Godfather is a tale of the struggles of man: their woes, fears, successes, and failures. Truly a masterpiece.",positive
My favorite movie of all time. It has everything you want from a great film. It is also still referenced in pop culture all the time 35 years after it won the Oscar.,positive
"This is a well-made classic movie. A good view of the corrupt lives of a mafia family, as well as the fear that such prestige can bring. It also reveals the strain that organized crime puts on one's family relationships.",positive
"I saw it again and still has all of the awesomeness from the first viewing. Great cast, great story, great everything.",positive
"The Godfather of Mafia films and anyone who doesn't like this film and likes any other Mafia film, doesn't know Mafia movies.",positive
"What can I say about this that has not been said already! This, along with the sequel (I am not a big fan of number III) are class.",positive
A school of great acting!Who can forget Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone or Al Pacino's melancholic look as he realizes that he can't escape from the family's heavy heredity and is gradually left alone?A really strong film by a great director and a classic soundtrack by Nino Rota.,positive
"Amazing film!i could watch this over and over!!amazing acting, amazing storyline.",positive
wat can i say wat a movie,positive
"An amazing tale of the dark life in a Mafia family. I'm glad I finally took the time to watch this movie. It's no question why this one best picture, it is simply stunning in the way things were back in the 1950s, and how crime was a huge part of American culture. The moment it ended I wanted to continue to Part II.",positive
I finally managed to get to this classic. And I must say it`s really a masterpiece. Great piece of acting and direction and last but not least the screenplay. I think it was important that Mario Puzo had a major influence in it.,positive
"Not nearly as good as everyone rambles on about. The story is standard affair, but the performances are really good.",negative
The best they Ever live!!!,positive
Leave the gun. Take the connoli.,positive

Simply put....BEST MOVIE EVER!!,positive

The best movie ever!!!!!,positive
AMAZING MOVIE! If you have not seen it then you are truly missing out on film at it's best. EVERYTHING about this movie is outstanding. The more I watch it the more I learn and the more I love it.,positive
"On first viewing I thought it was overrated. months later, I rewatched and became a true believer. BTW, The Don is not dead, but made God an offer He couldn't refuse and is now Bill Gates.",positive
Of Course It's A Great Movie,positive
"A true masterpiece. My best movie ever. An Epic saga with unforgettable historic performances from MARLON BRANDO , AL PACINO and all the cast , as well as the magnificent directing of FRANCIS FORD COPOLA . This is the greatest film of all time",positive
The greatest movie of all time. Career best performances by all cast members with the greatest ending of any movie.,positive

Never gets old my Dad let us watch it as kids!,positive
This ties with Magnolia as my #1 fave simply because it's hard for me to say that it's the SECOND best movie of all time. Sheer perfection.,positive
"""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"". Priceless.",positive
"A classic. The acting, the music, everything. All the quotes...",positive
Greatest Movie of All Time,positive
It is absolutely impossible to hate the Godfather. The characters and story line have been so well written it could well be a documentary. The script is iconic and each scene is a classic in its own right. Arguably the best film ever made. This depiction of gang warfare has never been matched by any other series of films. A film to see before you die!!!!!!,positive
"un capolavoro, grandissimo Marlon Brando!",positive

I loved this film! The horses head bit did put me off a little but I was soon recaptured into the film.,positive
"Loving it is a clichÃ©, but everyone elseâs favorite is mine, too. A work of art with characters that have since become objects of the Pop Culture Bible. You can tell itâs great just by how everybody recollects the scenes so enthusiastically and affectionately.",positive
This movie sucks tbh..,positive

I don't need to say anything else.,positive
"What can I say.......Absolute Gold. A classic that will, I hope, last for generations to come. I have the complete set on video and DVD and will be keeping safe to give to my sons.",positive
"Do we do terrible things because we're forced to by circumstance, or do we use circumstance to justify the terrible the things we do? This is a masterpiece of american cinema.",positive
"An epic crime classic. The story, fantastic and gripping. The direction, beautiful and magnificent. The acting, brilliant in every way. This is what movies are all about - style and substance, perfected to their highest form. There's too much to say about this movie...so I'll just say, watch it. In my mind, I still feel Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever...but this is a tie in every sense.",positive
"Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him. Ah - ah - ah - ah - ah!",positive
The crime drama of crime dramas...,positive
"From its captivating performances to its brilliant direction, The Godfather remains a landmark film. Whether or not you appreciate mobster movies, its impossible to argue with this authentic production. Marlon Brando gives his signature performance in a twisted tale of one evil and powerful family.",positive
"The most complete trilogy ever. Story was magnificently told with stellar performances from Brando, Deniro & Pacino in particular make for a T.K.O.Classic",positive

"Probably the perfect movie. It works on every level. Far from a glorification of unlawful violence, it is an indictment of the lawful gangsters created by capitalism. It's not personal - its only business.",positive
Not just another gangster movie,positive
THIS FILM IS A GEM STONE OF MOTION PICTURE MAKING FROM THE GREAT CAST LED BY THE EXTRODIANRY LEADING ACTOR MARLON BRANDO. THE GODFATHER IS SIMPLY A MASTERPIECE IN FILM HISTORY! AN EPIC MOVIE!

Pretty tight effort by everyone,positive

Can't believe I hadn't seen this masterpiece sooner. Great work of cinema.,positive
"One of the most greatest movies ever made. Scene where Don Vito finds his son Sonny in the morque after being killed by rival gangsters, when you watch Brando doing his thing, you know what real talent means. Coppola's vision works like clockwork.",positive
It's good and marvel in its day...but it spawned the whole macho Italian thing soooo...it gets 4 stars,positive

"What else can be said about having 5+ academy award winners all in the same cast. And come one, . . . a horses head in your bed, . . . you know they mean BUSINESS!!!",positive
"Overrated. This is a word often used to describe this film. Yet every review I've read defending this point of view fails to make any valid point. How can you make one with a film as brilliant as this.The stories of family, betrayal, murder, and business are juggled ingeniously so as to avoid confusion. Michael Corleone's rise from wanting to have nothing to do with the family business to becoming the don himself is brilliantly portrayed by the young rising star in Al Pacino. He is supported by one of the greatest ensembles ever gathered for a film. James Caan's fiery Sonny, Robert Duvall's complacent Tom Hagen, (both of whom, including Pacino, were all nominated for an Oscar) as well as John Cazale's naive Fredo, Diane Keaton's trapped Kay, and Talia Shire's tortured Connie all provide incredible performances. Richard Castellano and Abe Vigoda also provide authentic portrayals of the aging capos Clemenza and Tessio. Probably the best performance though belongs to the original don himself, Brando. He never misses a beat as Vito Corleone whether he is angry, hurt, or calculating. He rightfully won the Oscar for this, after he had to audition for the role in the first place. An amazing score from Nina Rota, and genious direction from Francis Ford Coppola push this film over the top as one of, if not the greatest, film ever made.",positive
an amazing adaptation of Puzo's novel. Brando is iconic,positive
One of the best movies ever made...,positive
"Wow. The fact that I would humbly title myself an avid movie collector and film trivia buff makes me slightly disappointed that I waited nearly 20 years of my life to see this film. I'd give it 4 or 4.5 stars because it's a little too long, but I feel deep down that I'd be committing some kind of film faux pas, or offending some ancient movie rating god or something. So 5 it is.",positive
I finally understand.,negative
could get boring but awesome story. who doesn't like the mafia,positive
leave the gun take the canoli!,positive

"It took me 24 years of life before I finally sat down to watch these movies. I was a FOOL. Pacino reluctantly becomes the patriarch to a crime family and wrecks shop in a very subtle performance. I love that Pacino, Caan, and DuVall could have switched off and played each others parts. Just a great fucking cast.",positive
The best movie ever made. some of the best music. Easily the best acting. its an awesome movie,positive
this is a classic why?,negative
"All these years we have been friends, and not once have you invited me into your house for coffee.",positive

All 3 movies are BRILLIANT.... My fav would be No2... a young Robert De Niro,positive
Who doesn't love The Godfather movies?,positive
"Hailed by IMDb.com, many ""official"" film lists, professional critics, and (apparently according to ""You've Got Mail"") most men in general, to be the best film of all time. And while I will not deny it to be a masterpiece and has proved to be an unshakably affective film, even 36 years later, I maintain there are better cinematic achievements. It is true this is the most believable family unit ever comprised in film history, with Marlon Brando proving effective acting can be masterfully executed with subtlety and reserved poise. It seemed, in the '70s, if a family oriented epic story was to be told, the best way to start would be to have a wedding. I'm referring, of course, to the fantastic hour-long introduction ceremony in 1978's ""The Deer Hunter"". The violence in the film is always brief, but very graphic, much like the gangster pictures of the immortal Scorsese; he and Coppola accomplished something many people have tried, but that no one has done well or timelessly executed. The point of ""The Godfather"", and though there are many, only one seems to hold the meat of the actions of the plot, is that no one listened to the godfather in the beginning, thus causing excessive harships in the end. Although, common sense defends, if things had not gone wrong, the film would have lacked an urgency that makes it so fascinating and compelling. I strongly believe that Al Pacino gives one of the best performances in the history of film here, as a man struggling equally with the pressures of his new responsibility of taking over his father's business and his struggle with love. For the year 1972, or maybe for the entire decade of the '70s, ""The Godfather"" is truly the reigning piece of work and the crowning achievements for both Coppola's and Pacino's careers.",positive

"BRANDO, FANTASTICO DEL CINE DE GANSTERS , PROBABLEMENTE LA MEJOR , JUNTO A SCARFACE Y AL PADRINO II",positive
Brilliant trilogy - and no the third one does not let the side down. Its a great film in its own right but has a lot to live up to the first two. Amazing cast list and much imitated but rarely equalled.,positive
A consummately American epic. The performances are phenomenal.,positive
best movie i have watched!,positive
Le meilleur des 3. Mario Puzo est un grand ecrivain !,positive
"The most powerful and riveting film ever. The importance of family values and legacy underlies the film's epic tale set against a New York Mafia family's battle to protect their empire. Every performance, scene and dialogue in this film is a lesson in filmmaking. Coppola's genius matched with Pacino's intensity and Brando's style. Simply Brilliant!!",positive
"For the first time ever seeing it, kind of disappointing that I already knew the dialog for the movie.",negative
the best movie of all times....,positive
"A masterpiece, a must have! great acting and the music of this film is just wicked",positive
"watched it again tonight, great movie",positive
There is no words to describe this magnificent movie!!!,positive
The cafe scene alone is worth the price but seeing Pacino's wonderfully understated performance as somebody rising to power as turbulent times are coming is such a pleasure to watch. Probably the only time that Pacino has done anything subtle.,positive
Amazing film!! Brando and Pacino - need I say more,positive
"One of my favorite movies ever, second only to part II",positive
An absolute corker of a film. The tension in the cafe scene still grabs me every time as the train gets louder...,positive
Un MUST SEE!!Nadie ha podido crear un mundo de mafias tan perfecto como el de El Padrino de Francis For Coppola.,positive
"The Corleone family isn't a part of society, they are society through a gritty, microscopic lens.",positive
Since it was the best movie ever made...it was the best movie I ever seen!,positive
"It's a classic, I love it! And I seriously have a thing for Marlon Brando!",positive
the best of the trilogy,positive
great movie but you might need to take the day off cus its long as shit,positive
"I never could get into this dramatic mob life stuff. I am pretty sure I watched at least this one, but that was the end of my run with 'The Godfather'.",negative
Almost like a documentary with the realistic scenes,positive
the best trilogy ever produced eventhough the third installement was a disappointment. this movie was a breakthrough in mafia movies. astonishing performances and dialogues,positive
Marlon Brando is the Godfather of acting!,positive
I could add another star to that,positive
"Seen it again yesterday and it hasnt aged a bit, classic film",positive
"The movie that made the Mafia 'cool'! Superb acting, directing and script from Mario Puzo's novel. What a cast!",positive
THIS IS 1 OF THE BEST MOVIES IVE EVER SEEN!!!!,positive
Amazing. One of the most stunning dramatic works that I have ever seen,positive
He's brilliant... even today it's a great movie,positive
it's a genious piece of art,positive
"Le hare una oferta que no podra rechazar... el resto es historia! todo excelente,actuaciones (Pacino,Brando)Excelente Historia para el recuerdo(La gran Familia)Excelente direccion! Capiche?",positive
"Its brilliant wonderful and fantastic. In the top 10 of NYC-set movies, though its lacks many authentic NYC settings.",positive
"Pretty much a perfect film, lots of action and an absorbing plot. three hours well spent!",positive
One of the few three-hour movies that can actually keep me entertained. 'The Godfather' creates and thrives in a unique cinematic environment.,negative
for the umpteenth time. I've only done this because my profile said the last movie i saw was Braveheart and I just wouldn't watch that sh**e. No idea where that came from.,positive
"I didn't really get this bloody film, but that could be due to my brother-in-law's father skipping through more than half the movie.",negative
"Masterpiece of its genre. Overall Excellency, especially the cinematography and production design. Must have been tough to direct such manly manliness...",positive
Marlon Brando... need I say more?,positive
Listen to Francis Ford Coppola's commentary for some interesting tidbits on how it got made and how he ending up directing it. Frederico Fellini turned it down.,positive
"Marlon Brando, lo mejor!!!",positive
"Avec le 2 et le 3...Vive Al Pacino, le seul acteur que j'admire vraiment...un monstre!",positive
Really worth 5 Starts !,positive
"I like part II almost as much as part I, III stinks",positive
One of the Best films of all time Nuff' Said,positive
This is one of my new fav movies of all time! I'm in awe.,positive
Great flick. what a cast!,negative
"I almost forgot one of the all time ""male"" classics. Good movie",positive
The best mafia-romantic-violent movie ever. And I have been on the Sicilian locations.,positive
mint mint mint mint MINT,positive
"One of the greatest movies of all-time! A great story with an amazing cast. If you don't enjoy this movie, then you don't understand the concept of what a film is supposed to be. Either that, or you have the attention span of a brick.",positive
"This movie was even better Than i thought it would be! No, it doesn't has a useless explosion every five seconds like an action film, it has a good plot. And, no, it wasn't too long in my opinion. Thought it ran for nearly three hours it kept me interested with interesting dialogue and good performances from the actors, mainly Brando and Pacino.",positive
A primeira parte da obra prima de Francis Ford Coppola.,positive
"Me quedo con algunas de estas secuencias *spoiler*: -El 1er intento de asesinato del padrino y el llanto de su guardaespaldas. -El asesinato de Sonny -La muerte del padrino junto a su nieto -Como Mike ""barre con la competencia"". -La secuencia final.",positive
an offer you can't refuse,positive
I just have to comment on this. Godfather has made a cult of followers. Sopranos made tributes to it and people till now use lines from it. A movie that provides highly used quotes till today and made success stories for most of it's cast. A must watch before you die film.,positive
The quintessential gangster movie.,positive
Best Movie Ever Made,positive
"Yes, it is as good as everyone says it is.",positive
"My Mom makes me watch it with her. It's too damn long, I have to admit - the acting is anything but ordinary.",negative
"Yes, I've only just seen it. It was pretty good, bit long though am I right? eh eh?... Just me? Oh screw you, you thought it was a bit long too.",positive
Y a pas d'excuses pour ne pas aimer ce film!!!!,positive
well my life is complete.,positive
It just doesn't get any better than this,positive
It is harder to think of flaws in this film then why it deserves five stars.,positive
Brando's best role. He will be remebered for it.,positive
Why did it take me so long to watch this movie - I have been deprived,positive
"Like the book itself,",positive
"Every two minutes, someone is doing a Godfather impression.",positive
A powerful movie. Every scene creates such strong emotion in the viewer. This truely lives up to its reputation.,positive
Without a Doubt. The Perfect Movie.,positive
this is one of the great films of American cinema. Nothing else to say.,positive
"This is one of the finest-directed films in history, with Francis Ford Coppola weaving a lush, immersive, sagacious tragedy. Iconic and expert performances, dialogue, and tension keeps the story fresh throughout the near-3 hour running time. This film includes my favorite scene of all-time: the restaurant meeting between Michael, Sollozzo, and McCluskey.",positive
"Decent movie, well-acted, ably-directed. Not nearly as good as the hype over it, but still a quality piece of work from all involved. The uneven story telling did me in, especially surrounding James Caan's character. It is nice to see Pacino actually acting for a change (his recent movies, with the exception of Heat, have all been one-note at best).",negative
the best movie i have seen. A true masterpiece.,positive
"This movie is what movies should be. This would blow you away, change your perspective of life. You will start talking like him and acting like him, you will fall in love with the music, and okay, Cut the crap reading my comment and as you can see from other comments they all say this movie is THE shit, so logout facebook and run to the nearest DVD store or get a friend that has some f$%k'n movie taste and take it from him and don't return it because 1 to 3 will blow you away.",positive
Marlon Brando does his finest performance in this well done movie.,positive
Its a philosophy not a film!,positive
"If anybody is disputing my rating, I'll make you an offer you can't(a) refuse.",positive
What more can I say?,positive
"What is there left to say about this titan of a film that hasn't been riffed, quoted, spoofed or re-enacted since it's release in 1972. It's a film that is infused in our culture, it's romantacized portrayal of American/Italian Mafia family feels so real to many who have grown up with similar heritage, it's metaphorical insight to capitalism in America is majestically 'Shakesperean' in it's delivery and although it's 'a bunch of gangsters doing a bunch of gangster shit' (to quote Tarantino) the audience is so emotionally connected that we actually care about these shady characters. The film is so richly and lovingly brought to the screen by Coppola who has infused his Italian heritage into every golden frame, and it feels somehow authentic. There is not enough superlatives to describe the performances, the eminently quotable dialogue and the hauntingly memorable scenes that stay with you forever once you experience them for the first time. A masterpiece that is so deserved of it's acclaim and arguably only bettered by it's sequel. A truly important artistic achievement from a visionary director.",positive
"Great, supebly acted, brilliantly complex, but...too long and has more holes than it seems anyone is prepared to acknowledge...",positive
THE GREATEST MOB MOVIE.,positive
the horse head in the bed happened in real life. frank sonatra and his mafia connection really did put a horse owners prized studs head in his bed to teach him a lesson.,positive
"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Great Acting, Great Direction and a very intense and deep storyline. It's the closest thing there is to a perfect movie.",positive
All time classic. Absolutely fantastically made.,positive
"It was great storytelling. A masterpiece. The trilogy had some unforgetable scenes like the horse's head found in the bed, and who can forget the heartbreak of Michael losing his wife and killing his own brother. Great films",positive
The 2nd best gangster film ever made!,positive
five stars says it all.Pacino is gorgeously spellbinding in this and all his movies.,positive
"I had tried watching this a couple of times before, but I just couldn't get into it. I really liked it this time.",positive
this was real mafia. lyk 4 REALLL!!!,positive
Great movie. Best PR documentary ever!,positive
"The heart of the drama, as I see it, lies in how the Godfather is fundamentally a pagan figure. The Godfather may put on Christian airs but does not follow Christ. This is shown in the belief that violence can be redemptive and how la famiglia Ã¨ piÃ¹ importante di niente altro! Contrast this belief with Christ's statement in Mathew 12:50 that whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother. There are admirable features of the Godfather but it is inevitably a path that keeps returning to death and destruction.",positive
"Una obra maestra. Nada mÃ¡s. Una de las mejores peliculas de la historia, si no la mejor.",positive
This film keeps you holding on every single scene. A rollercoaster that goes up and down various time throughout the film. Could be said that almost every scene is a great scene. A masterpiece no doubt.,positive
All Of The Godfather Films Were good,positive
"A classic, nuff said!!!",positive
2ND BEST GANGSTA MOVIE,positive
Quite simply one of the finest films ever made. Continues to inspire filmmakers eveywhere,positive
"Marlon Brando is versitile. I've seen some of his other works and he portrayed every character very differently. In The Godfather he displayed a variety of emotions, truthful and deep, and nailed every scene. Michael Corleone's change amused me. Can't believe Al Pacino got nominated for ""supporting actor""in this. He has more screentime then his Don.",positive
"The #1 Gang/Mob related/themed movie. When you spend your whole life memorizing lines form a movie, it's a good movie. Some of my favorite death scenes and some of my favorite death threat scenes are from this movie",positive
"Cool movie, especially since I love Al Pacino. And think I got to see this when I was a kid with my parents! A perfect balance of sobriety and gore. Truly a classic (for intellectuals atleast.)",negative
Buy far the best mob movie. The only other movie that comes close is the sequel.I think it should be watched in every high school cause its a piece of film making history.,positive
"Brilliantly carried through. Some of the actors (cough, Keaton, cough) gave some wooden acting, but Pacino, Brando and Cazale particularly made it up for them (...her). The scores are impeccable throughout, done by the maestro, Nino Rota.",positive
"A truly great film that chronicles Michael's downward spiral from an innocently ignorant outsider to a perfect example of a life he wanted to avoid. Entertaining, intriguing, timeless.",positive
la mejor de la historia del cine,positive
Brando a true GOD of cinema and helped launch the career of Al Pacino-utter brilliance!,positive
coppola es un pobre gue.. no?,positive
The Greatest movie ever made I love it I love it is amazing the story is just wonderful I LOVE IT.,positive
Probably the best film ever made. No other gangster movie has lived up to this. Simply brilliant,positive
"Brilliant!Brando and Pacino are excellent. Fantastic story, acting and pacing.",positive
"It is a symbol. This film has many message, many tips, many concept that you can use in your live. I think that all people need watch it",positive
"Seriously, the best movie. Ever.",positive
Greates film ever made.,positive

As perfect as a movie can be. Brilliant.,positive
"LEGENDARAN! mozda i najpoznatiji film svih vremena, mislim da i oni koji ga slucajno nisu gledali znaju za ovaj film i sta je postigao...",positive
What's not to like? Sets a standard that has not been met since!!,positive
yes this is one hell of a movie i love it,positive
Great! A true classic!,positive
It's a classic. GO SEE IT!,positive
"Al Pacino is the best! With a mixture of Italian and American culture, and the dark side of it, is put together in one film.Exceptional story plot. It's a film for adults combined with sharp, intelligent and witty acting and dialogues. There is so much to this film!",positive
Someone is going to have to explain to me why this film is considered the best movie ever.,negative
It means Luca Brazi sleeps with the fishes,positive
One of the best gangster movies goin!,positive
Second greatest film of all time!,positive
"Whilst this might not be the greatest film of all-time, it is still an epic masterpiece which certainly deserves almost all of its critical praise. Marlon Brando is unbelievably good, and though Al Pacino is wooden at times, the supporting cast never let him waiver too much. Though the film is far too long in places, its emotional story mainly sustain the interest. Overall, this remains a certainly a must-see film.",positive
"I am like most people when it comes to this movie. It's amazing. It never gets old either. But, I still am gonna say the book is better. And people hate me for that but ya know what? The book is better. 90% of the time that's true, whether you like reading or not.....if you don't read you have no say in which is better so yeah....leave me alone.",positive
Quite simply the best film ever made. Stunning.,positive
"""Oh. Who's being naive, Kay?""",positive
"I couldn't really get into this film at first, but when I did it was excellent!!! It's a great story with great acting!!!",positive
classikko mann...I am praying to you :),positive
"DUH GREAT FILM, WHO DOESNT LIKE IT!",positive
"if you tell you have not seen 'the godfather' and we're friends, chances are i will immediately sit you down and make you watch the entire trilogy. well. maybe i'd leave the third one for another day. but there's no better way to pass a blizzard, or a rainy day, than watching this film. incredible work of art.",positive
Extra ordinary and special movie,positive
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.,positive
"stand as an undisputed classic and the 1st of a trio of high quality films, a movie u can't refuse to view.",positive
"I WANTED to say that I hated this movie, that I don't get mob movies, and that this movie was nothing but a glorification of violence, but I can't. There are few movies as adeptly directed, the costumes and sets/locations were perfect, and the acting excellent. Really, this movie is one of the best films made. But still, it won't be put down as one of my favorites, and I won't give it 5 or even 4.5 stars because personally, it wasn't one of my favorites. For me it's like art. I'm not a big fan, for example, of impressionist art. I can recognize that there are many impressionist paintings that are masterpieces. However, I will never spend much time studying them because they aren't my particular favorite style. Same goes for this movie.",positive

"todo lo que hayas oido de ella es cierto, grandiosa",positive
I enjoy all Mafia movies,positive
i dont know why people think its gods gift i really dont. a good story for sure. but WAY WAY WAY too long,negative
The Godfather is the perfect movie!,positive
"I could watch this over, and over, and over...even on the same day:)",positive
I saw this for the first time when I was around 22 and I think it would've been lost on me had I seen it sooner. So much more subtle and classy than subsequent copycat mob movies. This is the standard for the genre.,positive
Waarschijnlijk een van de beste films ooit gemaakt die ook nog goede sequels kende,positive
totally awesome. and the game rocks too.,positive
Pure theatrical genius. :) A must see.,positive
Greatest ever!!!! part 2 is great too,positive
no es personal solo son negocios,positive
No merece mayores comentarios.,positive
"love all 3, but Brando was purely amazing. the most romantic, sleek, classy, Mafia movie ever made. id have named it ""The Rise of Michael Corleone"" but thats just me",positive
"Sadly, I just watched this for the first time and was, as to be expected, very impressed. Brilliant in every way, though it is becoming slightly dated in rare spots.",positive
the best film in history,positive
What can be said that hasn't been said. The best Mafia family movie ever made with the best assembled cast ever. It will be a favorite for years to come.,positive
need I reaaly say anything about this movie,positive
"awsome!! ""you may call me, godfather"".",positive
Awesomeooooooooooooooooooooo,positive
Greatest movie ever made!,positive
Quite simply...definitive!!! Those that slate III...just don't get it!,positive
"A timeless masterpiece, rightly regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. Its greatness lives in the engaging narrative, the strength of its characters and the wonderful fusion of acting and direction.",positive
"One of the ggreast films ever made. No matter how many times I've seen it, I can still sit down every time its on and pick up something new from it. Brilliant story, brilliant cinematography. All around, the perfect motion picture.",positive
Immense! great soundtrack also!!,positive
What would be your Godfather style if you were suddenly appointed Capo di tutti capo? Don Vito or Don Michael? Or are you a pimp like Tattaglia?,positive
Best mafia movie of all time whoever hasn't seen it needs to,positive
greatest movie ever!,positive
"Its one of the best. The locations in the film are spot-on. Perhaps there's nothing more I can offer to the body of critiques of this classic, other than to say it probably embodies better the 'idea' of the mafia in America than any other film, even if that ideal is romanticized and less-than-accurate in a total sense. I'm mean really, when was the last time you saw a Gambino in anything but a track-suit?",negative
"How can you not watch this movie over and over again, especially the Sunday afternoon marathons, I wish they would eliminate PartIII.",positive
"Should I say more? Al Pacino, u r true man1",positive
Best movie ever made on Mafia!,positive
"Very classic old school mob drama, filled with elegance, yet hard boiled feeling...",positive

My favourite of all times!,positive
I just don't get it.,negative
Al Pacino is just awesome,positive
"Very sloooowww and boring but if you can stand to pay attention, it is incredibly amazing!!",negative
I can't believe I lived this long without seeing this. Being married to an Italian it's almost sacrilidge.,positive
"AWESOME! & even though marlon brando has relatively little screen time, he gives the most awesome performance! also good bg score",positive
La mejor pelÃ­cula de todos los tiempos,positive
"I""d watch is again and again",positive
"incredible movie. more than just mob murferds and crime..its about family, betrayal and trust",positive

One of the best movies ive watched,positive
La mejor pelicula de la historia del Cine!!!,positive
One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The story is great it is a masterpiece of cinema.,positive

An almost perfect movie with an almost perfect final 20 mins.,positive
"A lesson to all aspiring members of the mob; when someone approaches you to get involved with narcotics, YOU SAY YES",positive
Best movie ever seen.,positive
way over rated..had 2 stop half way through...couldnt stand it...but over all good movie...even if i didnt like it,positive
Brilliant! It's hard for me to choose between I and II. I love them both. De Niro or Brando? It's hard to choose!!,positive
"classic, sophisticated.. mob movie.. brilliant casts!",positive
amazing film. one of the best crime films i've seen in my life. great performances.,positive
I loved Andrew Garcia. Toped by Marlon Brando. Huge impact in my life!,positive
"If there is a horse's head in your bed, you know you are in big trouble.",positive
The best film of the series and the genre.,positive
marlon brando - WOW!,positive
Simply a great movie! I am still looking for the full-length 12-hour version aired on US TV over 5 days in around 1980 ...,positive
"exelente, kero ser como estos weones",positive
The best mob movie ever made.,positive
Epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family.,positive

This is what the Italian Mafia is all about!,positive
My absolute favorite!!!!,positive
Best movie ever made. Honest look into Italian culture and history.,positive
"This isn't my favorite Coppola film, nor is this my favorite Godfather film, and it certainly isn't my favorite film of all-time. But it's a great example of pure visual storytelling. It's a film you just can't ignore, even if it's not quite as genius as people say.",positive
"One of the best films I have ever seen and I really hate violent movies, just to watch Al Pachino Michael develop into a mobster, brilliant acting",positive

Best movie ever made.,positive
Es la mejor pelÃ­cula que hay! Se tienen que ver las 3.,positive
"I love all three of these. Even though i knew that Michael would end up a lonely old man, i still felt sorry for him. Al Pachino really brings the story to life",positive
Fantastic. You have to understand how many films have taken scenes and ideas from this one; look at the strength that this film had to make such a big change in cinema.,positive
perfect. in absolutely every way,positive
"Epic story about mafia wars back in 40s. The movie is full of classical lines and scenes and it defines the way we think about American-Italian mafia today. Marlon Brando is just great, so is Al Pacino. Some may say the story is prolix and too long, but this is the art - Coppola shows us every detail of mafia family life.",positive
"se qualcuno vi proporrÃ  questo film da vedere,non potrete rifiutare.. if somebody suggest to watch this movie, you 'll can't refuse..",positive
Al Pacino and Marlon Brando...two of the greatest actors in history combine to make a classic...mobs and gangsters..family business...all the shooting..oh ya! thats what we like!!,positive
"""I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse."" Love it!",positive
"Does one really need to comment on the Godfather? The color, the lighting, the acting, the story...Magnificent...Still not as good as part II.",positive
Since pretty much everyone else has a lot to say about this movie I'll just keep it simple. It's good.,positive
Best movie of all time! Makes me proud of my Italian heritage! Gangster movies are the best!,positive
This movie more than any other I grew familiar with through recommendations and references from other movies. Saw it for myself. Loved it.,positive
"Best movie ever...possibly? Everything...the acting, the cinematography, the plot...whatever, was flawless and memorable. Many moments in the film will leave you speechless by how amazing they are, and i don't care who you are...the last scene of this movie will give you chills.",positive
The greatest of all FAMILY movies,positive

"Very good, very long.",positive
"I didn't like the content, I couldn't relate to anything in the film. As far as gangster films go, there are plenty others I'd rather watch. However, the film is flawless in execution. Even if I didn't like the story, it was told superbly.",positive
"No comment, it's just the best movie ever.",positive
do i really have to explain why this movie is so good?...now THIS is the ultimate cult classic,positive
The great American film.,positive
Vito Corleone is the best,positive
awesome action movie,positive
"The life of organized crime is portrayed as it is, unglamorous and bloody, led by virtues of loyalty and vengeance. At the center is a story of family, living thru hardships as any other does. With a powerful script, wonderful cast, an unforgettable score by Nino Rota and all elements surrounded by a rich atmosphere, this is not only the best gangster film ever, but one of the best American films ever made. But why am I telling you? You've seen it. We all have. And that's how you know it's great.",positive
The most amazing movie.,positive
"I Belive in America. ""America made my fortune"". muy buena pelicula, leccion de vida!",positive
This is one of the greatest movies ever. It's hard to imagine anyone who could hate it.,positive

It's not just a MAFIA movie...it's a great family film.,positive
The best overall movie ever. Best acting. Best lighting. Best cinematography. Best story. etc...,positive
"Best film in history, period.",positive
"Whereas Scorsese's mafia films give you the blistering and kinetic view of organized crime from the front lines, Coppola gives you an elegant, operatic slow-burn from the top. These films detail the shift that Italian Cosa Nostra underwent when they decided to enter the world of narcotics. The old guard slowly lost grip to young and hungry up-and-comers. The acting breathes life into what is at its heart, a family drama. The music and cinematography are absolutely golden (sometimes literally). It's pretty much flawless. You could write essays on all of the themes lurking below the surface: fate, honor, betrayal, foolishness, all things lurking in every family dynamic.",positive
Just watched it. The best film ever made.,positive
"Not deserving of ""greatest film of all time"" title.",negative

"Nada que decir, hay que quitarse el sombrero ante esta pelÃ­cula, lo mejor sobre mafia que se ha hecho en todos los tiempos",positive
it's been more than 35 yrs since this movie was made and i can bet that not a better movie than Godfather has been made since. Even no body has came close to it. The experience of watching this movie is so exhilarating tht u can't forget it. Every character in the movie is so well crafted and acted that even if u wanna find a weak spot in it u can not. Ever since the movie was made everyone has tried to copy it but no body has came close. I have watched it more than 3 times and can watch it any time again. Simply the best movie ever made and ofcourse my all time favourite.,positive
Ruined the whole horse head in bed thing for everyone,positive
"family, great quotes, great actors, and italians...what else can i ask for? Being italian its kind of part of the code to watch this and love it! But Francis Ford Coppola is great!",positive
one of the best movies there is,positive
Awesome....simply awesome,positive
A masterpiece. Incredible cast. Not one badly written or directed scene in the entire movie. It is in my top 5 of best films.,positive

A must watch. Got some pretty good lines in it. Plus a cast you'd never forget.,positive
Oh my goodness how adorable is the godfather i just want to squeeze him and hug him. Beautiful Epic.,positive
"What makes the Godfather so good, is not only the fact that it has the 'Dons' of gangster/mafia movies in its midst, but also that Francis Ford Coppola is a picturesque genius of visual art. Marlon Brando is one of the standouts, due to his unique performance. Cazale and Pacino are legends of this form of film...see Donnie Brasco, Scarface, or for Cazale: The Deer Hunter.",positive
i hav seen this movie like a bazillion times!!! love it!!!,positive
This movie is that good.,positive
Come on its the Godfather. At least see it once!,positive

"amazing crime film! marlon brando is amazing as vito corleone, al pacino also amazing! best of all 3 god father films!!",positive
The five star rating is all that needs to be said about this film. I dont know what else I could say about this film that hasnt already been said. A masterpiece.,positive
THese movie r kool!!!,positive
Simply perfect. The Ultimate movie,positive
Marlon Brando. A genius in some sense. You just watch a man playing godfather of Carleone family that you start to think - that guy actually is a gangster in real life too. Al Pacino so young that barely recognized him at the first moment. In the start of his career this was the most successful role he played (I think so) and he did perfectly. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino - one in a lifetime combination. A real enjoyment to watch this movie. Francis Ford Coppola did something unbelievable. Just LOVE IT,positive
Loving the whole Mafia Portrayal,positive
Its the Godfather duh,positive
Class bought the trilogy !!!!!!,positive
"Clearly one of the greatest films, and the most mocked (and paid tribute) by the Simpsons episodes",positive
I keep waiting for The Godmother.,negative
its ust the best movie i've ever seen,positive
"Um, did I miss something? Somewhere along the line someone convinced me (and the rest of the world) that this boring, overlong mess of a film was an all time classic. I don't get it. The story is a mess, the subplots don't matter enough for me to care about their resolution (the baptism scene? Give me a break, why was I supposed to care?) And the acting? Pacino was good, but not great. Brando was good, but I guess by this point Vito has become such a caricature that it loses some of its impact, though one can't blame the movie for that. James Caan is probably the best of the bunch. Robert Duvall barely did anything, and the women? What a joke! Talia Shire chews the scenery like nuts, screaming hysterically, and we're supposed to care why? Because she's a Corleone? Nice try, script, but you'll have to give me a reason to care. Ugh. It's not that this movie is actively bad, far from it, but when one of the revered greatest movies of all time turns out to be a bloated, messy tour-de-force of mediocrity, I feel like I have the right to be bitter.",negative
"Melancholic, stylish, great acting, cliche'ish, beautiful",positive
"This is such a great movie even now days. Great acting, great story. A classic all-around.",positive
"i'm just in mad love with this move, it is SUCH a classic and the father of all gangster movies. beautiful story, amazing acting jobs (big props for Marlon Brando), and direction that was so ahead of it's time. this really is a winner!!!",positive
"The Greatest Movie EVER, best adaptation of a book ever, best acting ever",positive
"Very tired of hearing about this film. Good, not great. Apparently the Mob owns Hollywood and the media tastemakers. zzzzz",negative
"Yes, this film is as good as you've heard. Arguably one of the greatest films of all time, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to mesmermize with its riveting story and A+ acting. <br/>By looking at the artwork attached to this film you would think that this is the story of Don Corleone (played by the Godlike Marlon Brando), but it is actually the tale of his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) who descends into the business not for himself but for his family.<br/>There's not much you can say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It's a masterpiece.",positive
A must watch film for all.,positive
Everyone has seen this film and everyone loves it so this review is really short. It's the Godfather an american classic. Overall: A+,positive
"The greatest, most amazing, most brilliant movie of all times. There's no denying that. No matter how many times you watch it. It just gets better and better.",positive

The daddy of all the ganster films !!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
It's a brill movie!!,positive

Marlon brando wht can i say?,positive
"Of course, I love this film since I'm Sicilian. My most favorite film of all time. Brando and Pacino are brilliant. Coppola is pure genius.",positive
best mob film i've seen,positive
Lives up to all the hype. Easily one of the best movies ever made,positive
"I tried to see this movie three times, but I couldn't get past around half way.",negative
"The most perfect film ever made. Try as hard as I may to find something wrong (I was forced to watch it as a child by my dad who regarded it as something of a holy scripture) it is flawless down to the smallest detail, all in service of the most ambitious and grandiose themes possible.",positive
im going to make him an offer he cant refuse,positive
"Great movie great cast, what can I say all around great movie",positive
"I'm going to strongly disagree that this is the best movie ever made. It was shot very well and acted incredibly. But it just isn't my cup of tea, and I found it a little boring. There were lots of scenes that I enjoyed quite a bit with tons of suspense.",positive
Really need to watch it again,negative

"superb! finally got a chance to watch this classic, really hope to finish the whole trilogy asap...",positive
all time favorite!! an awesome memorable masterpiece,positive
Classic. What the hell else can I say besides that?,positive
"Awesome movie, best in the series. If someone were to make a special edition of this, and change it in any way, I would kill them.",positive
"Slow, deliberate. Mario Puzo's classic brought to life. Not for everbody, but a movie every man MUST watch.",positive
MI FAVORITA.. ME HIZO UNA PROPUESTA QUE NO PUDE RECHAZAR,positive
"This might be the most beloved movie of all time, and for good reason: it's the gangster movie that all ganster movies want to be... hell the movie every movie wants to be. A masterpiece.",positive
"I have been told by many for a long time that this is an excellent movie. It has taken me a while to see it, but I have to say that it wasn't just a bunch of hype. It was also interesting to see all the references they made to how organized crime works through other businesses (e.g. Hollywood, Vegas, etc.). Regardless I would highly suggest this movie, and I intend to see Part II sometime soon.",positive
the movie of all movies..,positive
Haaaa! el clasico de los clasicos de mafiosos (junto con Scarface). Marlon brando y Pacino: combinacion explosiva! - Te tengo una oferta que no podras rechazar( Michael Corleone-Al Pacino).,positive
No need to comment...I cant add anything...the movie speaks for itself,positive
An incredible piece of work here. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino really were magnificent in this picture. With a great story and a great pace. This was a truly superb film to say the least. Totally worth seeing!,positive
"Litt problemer med kvalitetet pÃ¥ DVDen gjode nok at dette ikke er en 5-stjerners film. Men jeg er klar for en reprise. Og Gudfaren part II, III, osv osv",positive
Somebody explain this movie to me in real terms. Just did NOTHING for me.,negative
everything a movie could be,positive
Reminds me of mny own family...,positive
"Simplemente GenialÂ¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡ Marlon Brando excepcional, Al Pacino en su mejor papel",positive
One of the best EVER made series!! I would have to say it is VERY difficult to choose which of the Godfather movies that I like more. I love them all! BEST TRILOGY EVER MADE!! AAAAAAA+++++++++,positive

"I can't say anything more than what everyone is already thinking, thought or dreamt over one of the BEST films EVER!!!! It is a CODE many live by and words shouldn't even be allowed to express if you know what's good for you :)",positive
"I still prefer this to Godfather II but only just - an epic family drama, superb performances and while it may romanticise the Mafia, it tells a cracking tale.",positive
"Superb, though can be a little confusing at times.",positive
Absolutely awesome. I love it.,positive
"Pacino is an unlikely hero, but his casting is a master stroke. The double shooting in the diner is one if the best scenes in cinemea.",positive
"absolutely flawless. except for Talia Shire's performance, and even that's expertly redubbed and edited around. I go back and forth as to which Godfather is the superior film, but most of the time, I think this one is actually a hair more perfect than Godfather 2.",positive
This movie is the BEST. bellissimo,positive
a nice mafia movie the best ever,positive
The best movie ever made.,positive
"THE gangster movie, uh yea. Awesome. So good that I never thought it was too long",positive
The best movie ever made (which almost makes me want to read the book...not quite).,positive
This movie sparked an interest in mobster movies I never had!!! I can't believe I only just recently saw it!,positive
la mejor pelÃ­cula de la historia dicen por ahÃ­.,positive
The greatest movie ever created in the history of movie making...,positive
"I loved this movie! It is a great classic to watch, especially when Brando does such a fantastic job.",positive
"loved it, as good as everyone says, possibly better.",positive
"I'm not sure how one can improve on this movie. The Godfather is visually stunning, the acting is exceptional, and the plot is flawless. Its three hours flow like the Mississippi and I can't think of too many films that can be watched over and over again while still managing to entertain and excite. The Godfather made the reputations of De Niro, Caan, and Pacino, but it made Brando a god among men. Unbelievable!",positive
One of the greatest of all time...,positive
FabriTIZo... No NOOOOOOOO!,positive
"Esta es una SEÃORA PELICULA...Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer...ohhh las enseÃ±anzas del Padrino, memorables para siempre...Capisciiii????",positive

Awesome movie!!!!!!!!!!!,positive

"I felt like I needed to watch it again. I think that I missed some parts. Not bad, I guess",negative
best film of all time ....or else,positive
the best mafia season ever,positive
"This movie is, without a doubt, one of the crowning achievements of Hollywood. Gangster/mobster/mafia films always try to meet the standard met by the Godfather but not one has succeeded (except the second movie of course).",positive
"Its very good, a little hard to understand the first time I watched it. Pacino, Brando, and Caan are amazing though. Watch it a couple times to really get it",negative
Perfect in every way.,positive
this is a very good fuckin movie,positive
The film sur la mafia! Les acteurs sont excellents! Et pas seulement Brando et Pacino!,positive
La madre de todas la Reglas !! Ten cerca a tus amigos PERO A TUS ENEMIGOS TENLOS MAS CERCAS !!,positive

An offer impossible to refuse.,positive
"Unquestionably the greatest gangster movie ever made, plain and simple.",positive
"Classy, outspoken and interesting. I never thought I could like The godfather, but this was surprisingly warm and inviting. Marlon Brando was fabulous, and so was the score.",positive
"Marlon Brando is unique & unusal. See the casting, you won't be see again",positive
"really great story, and the books are just as good",positive
Hay que ver y aprender mucho de esta pelicula!!! jajajajajaja es un clasico y una de las mejores pelicula de la historia,positive
love it..... its the best.....,positive
"the only real question is: which is better, gf1 or gf2.",positive
Love the movie. Love the accent and love the storyline.,positive
you have to love it~,positive
Good if you like silly slapstick fun.,positive
"Fucking classic, before Pachino got annoying as hell.",positive
very close to the book which is amazing. such a twisted tale with characters that you love to hate. marlon brando and al pacino are pretty much perfection.,positive
"I'll make you an offer you can't refuse. you will see the godfather. you will love the godfather. you will know that the godfather is one of the greatest movie ever. Now, if that was said in the same raspy Don Corleone/Marlon Brando voice as in the film, you would go and see the movie now. you should do that anyway because the rumors are true, this is one of the best movies ever. i'm talking about the original. Acting? brilliant. Directing? stunning. Writing? beyond amazing. so many things are wonderful about this movie. i've seen it dozens of times, but every time i see it on tv, i can't help but being sucked into it. The scene in the resturant with michael, sollozzo, and the cop is so intense, it is perfectly filmed. there are few words that can describe it. how about... masterpiece.",positive
"My favorite quote from this movie is when Al Pacino says, ""Don't tell me you are innocent, it insults my intelligence, and makes me very angry."" If Don Corleone told me that I would be scared. Great Great movie. =)",positive
"If you are over the age of 10, live in the first world, and aren't blind, you have no excuse for failing to see this film.",positive
"Only the family matters,,Right?",positive
I suppose I would be trite in saying it's the best movie ever made. I don't care-it is.,positive
Wonderful. Exquisite. Indescribable,positive
"This is the greatest movie of all time and never let anyone tell you otherwise. From the introduction of all the characters at the wedding through through Michael's ascension to the top of the ranks, no movie encapsulates all lthe qualities of a great story. When it comes to movies adapted from books, you often hear that the movie is never as good as the book. Anyone worth their salt should immediately follow that with the words ""except The Godfather."" Excellent cinematagrophy, great directing, a breakout role for some guy named Al Pacino are all contained within. Everything you ever needed to learn you can learn from this movie.",positive
"Are you kidding? its the godfather, one of the greatest american classics of all time!",positive
"un analisis transversal de la mafia, no solo la de new york, sino de todos lados",positive
the greatest film ive ever seen!,positive
Epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son.,positive
what a powerfull film!Brando and Pacino at their best-Coppola has also spread his intelligence all over.. The story...just tragic and moving at the same time..,positive
This Corleone made me an offer I couldn't refuse!,positive
Que guion exelentes actores expectalula trama. el maestro copola y puzo,positive
esta es la mejor de todas....,positive
"THe godfather of films, Al Pacino is brilliant as he is slowly twisted into his fathers personality and role",positive
"An amazing movie. Great story, great acting.",positive
"J'ai Ã©tÃ© surprise de ne pas Ãªtre aussi emballÃ©e par le film que je le pensais. Faut dire que la voix de Al Pacino m'Ã©nerve un peu quand il la mue en mafioso sicillien, alors c'est mal parti. J'ai quand mÃªme aimÃ© des films moins que Ã§a. Vive Coppola !",negative
Very slow movie. A little overhyped but very memorable conversation pieces.,positive
Probably the best film ever made,positive
otac bog i majka mafijaskih filmova.,positive
All I can say is wow!!!,positive
"Lo mejor de Marlon Brando en una ilustre carrera: ""Le voy a hacer una oferta que no podrÃ¡ rechazar"".",positive
"It is quite difficult to watch a film that has so greatly influenced popular culture. Many scenes that would be great as a surprise are spoilt by knowing what's coming. The characters have also been parodied so much by comedians that I was half expecting Don Vito to have the body of Jabba the Hutt (http://bit.ly/jWsILe)! Thankfully, the film is very well acted and draws you in. It's slightly long, there were a few sub-plots I didn't care for (Pacino getting married abroad) and some which were left undeveloped (Tom Hagen's story). I don't know if I could face parts 2 & 3? It also gave me an understanding of why people like Al Pacino. I've seen a lot of his films and can't stand him but in this he is brilliant!",positive
Need I say anything?... :-),positive
wow - why did it take me so long to get this one out?,positive
Rate this 5 stars or sleep with the fishes,positive
"Great movie, great story!!!!!!!",positive
No contest five stars. Two words...Marlon Brando.,positive
"Best Godfather flick ever. This, paired with G-II would have been enough to show the underworld at it's ... Finest? shall we say? (They could have skipped G-III, in my humble opinion).",positive
"Favorite film of all time, period.",positive
An absolute classic piece of cinema. This should be required viewing.,positive
"What can be said that hasn't already? The Godfather is the gold standard of mob movies. Taking the true meanings of Omerta and Family to heart, embracing them in the Italian-American culture and letting them breathe. The sequel provides a deeper emotional punch to the set-up in this movie, but this is a rich experience that never ages.",positive
Fantastic - a classic in every sense.,positive
Greatest of all time...,positive
"Legendary, no need for other words",positive
the original and best gangster movie ever made,positive
Might not be as good as the book - but this is about as near to perfection you can get,positive
"i grew up with the godfather i must have seen it 50,000 times it's still a favorite",positive
"absolutely incredible, probably the best movie of all time...",positive
The best movie ever filmed. Everything about it is perfect,positive
la mejor pelicula de la historia,positive
"As a film studies student I always felt like a bit of a fraud not having seen this movie, so I finally got my act together and watched it last night... What can I say..? A pure masterpiece in filmmaking, the camera work is something else, the final shot of Michael from the doorway is awesome... The acting is something else, the way Pacino goes from innocent to Don as the movie progresses is breathtaking and Marlon Brando!!! (wow)... I loved this film, it's not my all time favourite gangster film, but it certainly set the bar for films to come...",positive
"Of course I've seen all three films, but you can't beat this one. It captures you from the very 1st line. Al Pacino's breakthrough performance! This is one of the best movies you will ever see.",positive
A True Epic Of A Movie & One That Makes You Realise How Big A Movie Star Marlon Brando Was Back In The Day. Great Buildup & Establishing Off Characters Leaves You Glued Right To The Screen Right To The End. On A Side Note Queen's Rendition Of The Theme Tune Is Quality!,positive
perfect movie!! best movie ever made,positive
A very powerful movie.,positive
The Greatest Film of All-Time. Period.,positive
"The greatest movie ever made imo. Dramatic movie you can watch over and over again. Michael Corleone's character development in this movie is done brilliantly. Having Marlon Brando in this movie is also a major bonus. Two scenes that stand out. Michael sitting in a chair while discussing how to ""take care"" of The Turk. With pure acting, viewers can sense Michael's powerful presense, although he was a little factor in family business matters up to that point. The funeral scene was also awesome. Michael silently watching the actions of his counterparts and calculating in his head who his enemies are. In the end, this is simply the greatest movie ever made.",positive
One of the greatest movies ever made...nuff said,positive
"I finally watched it and boy, what a masterpiece. Surely there's no one like Marlon Brando.",positive
"I love Vito Corleone voice, his voice was serios killer. Very cool fellow. And Michael Corleone is the best.But i prefer Al-Pacino in this movie as he acting with some kind of cold but vry cool. His charecter was really cold cold cold but vry exciting.",positive
"Dull, time wasting, painfully worthy adaptation of a trashy novel. Maybe it's just not for me, but I couldn't bring myself to care for a second about a single character or anything that happened. As great as the elements of this film clearly are, much like Frankenstein's monster, without the vital spark that this films lacks they are just pieces of corpse laying on a slab.",negative
"An epic series which, for anyone who remotely likes gangster flix, will have you wanting the whole set with extras. Worthy of five stars for sure",positive
I had to use subtitles to understand Marlon Brando.,positive
"C'mon. You have to hate movies not to like The Godfather. The only things I don't like about this movie is how I have to guess as to who is who because there are approximately one billion characters in this film (understandable, seeing as how the movie spans over a many years), and how you are really left as to guess what Brando is actually saying. Both are excusable.",positive
"Long, but interesting.",negative
"Brando tout simplement magistral. Un film qui m'a tenu en haleine pendant prÃ¨s de 3 heures. Avec un premier plan magistral qui Ã©difie dÃ¨s les premiers instants le personnage de Vito Corleone comme une icone! Un film triste, dur, et au combien humain, un film qui en sous-entendu dresse le portrait d'une amÃ©rique noire et corrompue!",positive
"A powerful piece of cinema which portrays the culture of 1950 Italia mobsters, has yet to disappear into cinema history.",positive
"One of the best movies of all time, not just only one of the best Mafia movies.",positive
"Read the book first, and it really doesn't do the book justice",negative

I am in love with Michael Corleone.,positive
"""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse."" The greatest mafia movie ever!",positive
Perfectly observed with strong performances all round.,positive

"I had to see this movie many, many times before I could keep all the characters straight in my mind. I'm sure it's really a great movie, but it's not my thing at all.",negative
"This is obviously a movie that is hard to criticize. I found the wife in Sicily to be an underdeveloped character and generally did not enjoy the scenes in Sicily. That is nitpicking, though.",positive
Nothing needs to be said.,positive
Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are great in this movie,positive
Oranges and Willis' yellow light and shadow.,positive
The best film ever could watch all 3 over and over again along with good fellas and snatch!!,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time supberb acting by everyone in it with memorable scenes this is a movie that everyone should see,positive

The best gangster trilogy of all time.,positive
"Mi favorita, sin palabras",positive
The definitive movie....it is a timeless study of one family..Awesome,positive
Gangster movies don not get any better than this! This movie took gritty violence and gave it a name and set the standards for movie anti-heroes.,positive
wishing i hadn't seen it!,negative
Very Italian!!! I really love Marlon Brando! Francis Ford Coppola show evidence of all his genius!!,positive
got to be the best film ever purely on acting never before has there not been a weak link,positive
absolutely nothing better,positive
SOMEDAY I MAY CALL ON YOU FOR A FAVOR....UNTIL THAT DAY...CONSIDER THIS A GIFT,positive
"Tout simplement gÃ©nial, malgrÃ© quelques longueurs",positive
Just a freaking awesome movie.,positive
There's a reason why it's a classic movie,positive
It has been argued whether this is the greatest film of all time. It's arguable. Top 10? That's not even arguable.,positive
"For those who are unable to choose between The Godfather Part 1 and Part 2, let me simplify it; Brando. The ulitimate actor's actor gives a world-class performance in a movie rich with them. Classic deaths, classic quotes, classic story. A movie more gangster than the gangsters. What else?",positive
Can't you ask a better mafia movie other than this?,positive
The father of all gangster movies.,positive
No words...a master stroke.,positive
Easily one of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
"I love it. I love it. And I Love it. This is great. Brando does his best acting here, as Don Corleone. Not seen it yet? Do it - please?",positive
"A manly man movie, fantastic dialogue and story",positive
"i hate english papers, but after seeing this i wanted to write one on it. seriously, it's that good.",positive
"Le meilleur film de tout les temps. Et qu'on ne me contredise pas, sinon...",positive
"Un ""vide"" cinematographique que je souhaitais combler depuis longtemps... et resultat : je suis vraiment comblee ! Un classique qu'il faut absolument regarder, sans fin (faim) !",positive
"One of the best movies ever. So tight. I just saw it again, it had been a while, and it's just so damn tight.",positive
Truly king of all forms of Urban Gangster Cinema,positive
"I actually prefer the second one more, but hey. I gotta put the first one first. It's long, but good. I promise, everyone should see it once in their life",positive
"Marlon Brando, Al pacino, Robert du vall, Robert de niro, james cann...nuff said greatest film of all time",positive
one of the greatest movie by greatset actores,positive
Watch this or do not tell anyone you've seen enough films,positive
"I loved this movie starring Marlon Brandon, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. I love the deep, rich plot and the fact that Al Pacino plays a character who's torn between entering the family-run organized crime business and maintaining his sense of integrity.",positive
everyone alive must see this classic,positive
"A no brainer in any list of favourite films, surely?",positive
"I read this book when I was 13 because I wasn't allowed to see the movie at the time. It is a complex and intriguing story about simple and feral characters that are loathsome, evil and brutal - but at the same time completely fascinating. Unfortunately gave Italian americans a bad rap.",positive
"Que se puede decir... un clÃ¡sico de clasicos, excelentes actuaciones, excelente musica, fotografÃ­a... FFC se luce con esta obra maestra. Ademas como dice el personaje de Tom Hanks en ""YouÂ´ve go mail""... ""en el padrino estan todas las respuestas a las preguntas importantes en la vida. Imperdible.",positive
"How the heck you end up rooting for the lot of nasty gangsters is the genius of this film. ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. """,positive
Read the book. I'm not comparing the 2 media. It's just that i believe the movie would have been much more effective (in terms of Drama and Character creation) if Coppola could have stuck to the book's Story telling structure. And that really is the backbone of this story.,negative
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse,positive
El Antiguo Testamento ......,positive
The true original...no one is colder than a Corleone.,positive
la trilogie Ã  voir et Ã  revoir!!!!,positive
The greatest movie of all-time and the book is even better.,positive
"A modern American classic, though I do think it goes on a bit too long.",positive
Classic....just a classic,positive
REALLY GOOD FILM TO WATCH,positive
I'm not sure what movie Heath Placek saw but The Godfather more than encompasses the traits to be the greatest movie of all time. I do agree that Road to Perdition is a great movie,positive
"just watch it and see what you think and if you like it, dont listen to what dumbasses say about the other two being crap; they are all excellent",positive
"Almost perfect film-making, thoroughly engrossing and much imitated. Al Pacino is brilliant as a young man who loses his soul to protect his family. If you are a film-lover you must see this.",positive
The movie that you can't refuse to watch!!!,positive
"Had the final part been wrapped up with the baptism scene, this would of been a perfect ending.",positive
simplemente una obra maestra,positive
One thing I thought it was the most amazing thing in the movie is that there is no suspicion. There was no mistake. They always killed the right person.,positive
classique du genre avec des moment me rappelant ma famille...tout proportion gardÃ©e bien sur lol,positive
Great Film. Michael's journey to becoming the head of the family and his transition into the Don makes for a masterpiece.,positive
My favorite of the trio I believe,positive
....and FAB music !!!!,positive
Simply one of the best movies ever made.,positive
big movieÂ¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡,positive
Probably the greatest movie ever made. This movie started the greatest trilogy of movies ever made. I can not help but watch it every time it comes on tv,positive
Michaels transition is so smooth and seemless into the Don its's beautiful.,positive
A landmark in 1970's cinema; a benchmark in all cinema.,positive
A Classic. A Masterpiece.,positive
Greatest movie of all time,positive
i definitely have this collection at home,positive
"Only the single greatest movie ever made. I find it hard to believe that in our lifetime this movie will be surpassed as the greatest of all-time. The first time I watched it, I was not that impressed. But the second time, I completely fell in love with its themes of Family and Loyalty. This story of young Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) destiny and his path to the 'family business' is such greatness. The story of the aging Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) looking for his heir apparent, and finding it in a place he never wanted to is the story for the ages. The absolute greatest movie of our lifetime.",positive
"The best opening to a film ever, one of the finest films ever, won't be anotehr one like it!",positive
Best mob tale ever told!,positive
"If you don't like this movie, you don't like movies!",positive

Classic. Coppola at his finest! Sets up the next installment perfectly. How is this not the best movie ever?,positive
Marlon Brando is the best actor. Ever.,positive

The most quotable drama of all time. I never tire of seeing this when it comes on tv.,positive
"no tan buena como el libro , pero bien para la epoca en que se filmo",negative
Beautifully made film.. outstanding performances from everyone,positive
[color=black]The Godfather is a great mix of family and buisness and the struggle of the mafia.:fresh: [/color],positive

Puzo's crime saga brought to stunning life.,positive

"This film is so amazing..One of my personal favourites..Great play,great storyline ,great actors.",positive
Awesome. A prerequesite for the game 'Mafia'.,positive
Everyone needs to see this movie. End.,positive
"Classic. Long, Gory and Complicated- but don't worry about it. Make sure to see Godfather II - it makes GF I a lot better.",positive
"Loses half a star with me because Brando, as good as he is, was a bit hard to understand at times (watched it on TV after all). Plus it got sorta hard to remember anyone not part of the family. In any case, loved it. Fantastic acting, esp. with Pacino as he portrayed Michael slooooowly turning into the cold-hearted boss that he is by films end.",positive
"The Greatest Trilogy of them starts with a step, and this movie will show why it is so...",positive
It made me an offer I couldn't refuse.,positive
It has a terrific reputation for a reason. All the actors are just fantastic.,positive
What else is there to say about this movie. Probably my second favorite movie.,positive
classic movie. a little slow at first but its a story that seems believable.,positive
Meilleur film qui soi!,positive
simplement cine-arte,positive
Un guiÃ³n muy bien trabajado que cuenta con los actores indicados para cada personaje.,positive

my favorite movie. best movie ever made,positive
best movie of all time,positive
I grew up watching this movie but didn't really get it until college. Now I LOVE it!!,positive
"I liked it a lot more after I saw it a second time, but it's still never going to be one of my favourites.",negative
"What can I say about this,Superb storytelling,Brando and pacino,incredible music,some unforgettable scenes,...mama mia this is a classic!",positive
"A classic. Love the book and the movie. The story set in the 40s, New York. It is about the power struggle among the Mafia family. Marlo Brando and Al Pacino put up a great and unforgettable performance.",positive
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,positive
MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!,positive
The greatest movie ever made.,positive
While I can understand the negative vibes about Citizen Kane but can anyone actually hate the Godfather? I mean this movie has everything. Not really my favorite but I can definitely understand why people put it up there in the AFI List. :),positive
"So, yes, it does draw on some stereotypes, maybe...I guess its debatable. But its a great film.",positive
"i watch it every time it's on any channel. Never get tired of it! Best immortal line of the movie: ""i'll make him an offer he can't refuse"". AWESOME!!!",positive
"First time I saw this movie, I got bored half way through and couldn't wait till the end. I clearly could not see why this movie is so highly regarded that it tops IMDB's top 250. However, I gradually came to appreciate this movie, the deep clash of conscience of Michael Corleone combined with Marlon Brando's superb performance. Overall, I hold this movie in high regard, but not for it's over excessive length.",positive
"What can I say? This is a classic quality movie with great story and acting - a masterpiece of filmmaking. ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't resist""",positive
"stunning crime epic!! great performances from the whole cast, especially marlon brando and al pacino!!!",positive
Best movie in hollywood's history. I have watched many great movies but this movie is the best of best.,positive
Now here's an Academy Award winning movie,positive
La segunda mejor pelicula que e visto,positive

"One of the greatest films! A classic, beautfully written, directed and Marlon Brando!",positive
My favourite movie. Everything in this movie is magic. And so are the second and the third. This is a masterpiece.,positive
best movie in the world ever.,positive
What can somebody say about this movie that others have not already said?,positive
Life for Dummies. The ultimate how to guide on life.,positive
"Not as great as everyone claims it is. I really enjoyed both Brando and Pachino in their respective roles. Brando was excellent as the sad, aging gangstet while Pacino is an excellent innocent person that is corrupted by the negativity around him.",positive
"Wow! If you haven't seen it, see it. It's a looong flick ~3 hrs, but worth the viewing!",positive
its the best movie in my view...i wanna put it on the number 1 rank out of my total movies which are i've enjoyed....really its great...i love it so much....,positive
"This is, without any question, the best movie I've ever seen",positive
Didn't think i would but i really liked it,positive
I don't know why it took me so long to see this...But it was worth it OH how it was worth it. Fuckin loved this film.,positive
"To me, the greatest movie of all time. Enough said.",positive
I know people say these are great but they aren't my type of film :S,negative
"Simply put ""The Greatest Film of All time"". The film that defines sheer mastery of Francis Ford Coppola who along with Pacino and Brando produces the most iconic film in history.",positive
"I cant believe its taken me so long to see this movie! It was worth the wait, it opened my eyes within the world of Mafia families",positive
One of the best films ever!,positive
omg best mafia film ever.........,positive
"""Make him an offer he can't refuse""",positive
"This, along with 'The Conversation' and 'Apocalypse Now', (all by Francis Ford Coppola) is a masterpiece of American cinema. A must see movie...a big part of American popular culture.",positive
HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS MOVIE!?!?!!?!?!?!?!,positive
A perfect movie. No point in commenting on it.,positive
great movie. classic,positive
Just the best movie!,positive
Do I really need to give a review on this?,positive
"Prima di tutto, inizia una nuova generazione di film, anche e un po' vecchia e buonissima",positive
"hmm, okay i'm probably the only person who didn't like this movie All THAT much. it was good but the hype kinda brought it down a bit for me, everyone told me i should see it. The music was great and the acting was great and the plotline was interesting i suppose but i found myself pretty bored throughout... um, yeah i don't really know why, like i can't find anything wrong with the movie i guess it just isn't my style. But i would recommend it to someone, because it is a good well made movie but it's just not one i personally enjoyed.",negative
The most iconic and intriguing gangster epics of all time. A must own,positive
It truly deserves to be called a classic because even now it doesn't loose it's meaning or impact.,negative
"Wow, what an excellent film. Coppola has an amazing way of balancing the family Corleone's strife with the families business and the betrayal and backstabbing that is slowly surrounding them. Marlon Brando played an amazing Vito Corleone, very believable and sincere in this role. Al Pacino also did an excellent job. It was almost like the actor and character aged nearly 10 years. The first time we see Michael Corleone it is almost a completely different person by the end. He is so much more sure of himself and has so many things on his mind. Anyways, Like I said, excellent film",positive
Not much more can be said about the Godfather that hasn't already been rehashed a thousand times. So my saying that this film is a gift from the Gods? Been said. 4893754895603489659034 times.,positive
You should already know.,positive
I cannot say anything about this movie... simply incredible.,positive
"So classic, telling the best known gangster film ever, with fantastic performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino",positive
Possibly the greatest film ever. Classic. Pacino and Brando. Wow.,positive
"Classic. Very fascinating story, and Marlon Brando's voice makes it perfect as well musics.",positive
"As an Anglo-Italian this film shows me the warmth and confilick of family life and the harshness of life outside the bubble, gangster or not. CLASSIC",positive
tÃ¤ssÃ¤pÃ¤ klassikko joka pitÃ¤Ã¤ jokaisen tuntea. mahtavaa mafiatarinaa jossa perhe tulee kaiken edellÃ¤. rikolliset ovat rikollisia vain koska se on ainoa keino saada leipÃ¤ pÃ¶ytÃ¤Ã¤n. asiat hoidetaan tyylillÃ¤ ja rikoksesta tulee bisnes..,positive
This movie was Ill i must have watched this movie a dozen times,positive
Its a great movie and thats all I can say,positive
The standard when it comes to character development,positive
This is a classic. It's set in a time when being a gangster was civilised. Well as civilised as gangsters go.=],positive
One of the best movies ever made a perfect classic just an incredible movie over all.,positive
I enjoy the triolgy......all three of them.,positive
"learn how to managed your enemies..... ""Never hate your enemies, it affects you judgment.""",positive
amazing movie...i find it incredibly relistic how al pacino changes from the black sheep of the mob family to the ruthless head,positive
al pacino is amazing actor!,positive
"Absolutely incredible. Certainly one of the best movies ever made, period.",positive
If God directed films....,positive
Classic...the whole cast was terrific. Marlon Brando will always be the King of the Godfather role!,positive
I really wish Sonny didn't die but other than that its a 20/10.,positive
Greatest movie of all time without a doubt.,positive
I never get sick of this film. It's a classic by any right.,positive
"saw love it , hell im all for this one",positive
Jeg var meget overrasket !,positive
My favourite out of the trilogy. Brando owns the film. You can feel his prescence even when he is off screen.,positive
"Top 10 film ever. Story, music and photography reach a new level in this film. A must see.",positive
"A classic, of course, but didn't keep me as entertained as I was hoping, considering all the rave.",negative
Top 2 movies of all time!!!,positive
Truely a classic. Al Pacino is awesome!,positive
one of if not the greatest movie of all time,positive
am required as male to like this movie.,negative
"The acting, screenplay and direction are superb. One of the best movies made.",positive
"Here's the thing about The Godfather. Yes, it is extremely well made/shot. The direction here is... well, if anything has ever been deserving of winning best direction, its the Godfather. For that, I insanely respect this movie. My only real gripe I have with this flick is that its slow at parts. Meaning, most of the movie. Even though it has incredible direction, a well thought out story, and quotable dialog, it drags. You never know when its going to end, and that eventually becomes annoying. But yes, I thoroughly enjoy this film. I just think it suffers from pacing problems that really go nowhere. Long movies don't bother me, but when it feels like its chasing its own tale, its a problem. Still, when I'm in the mood for this movies, its utterly captivating.",positive
This movie floors me every time I see it. Not much more to say.,positive
this is the best trilogy ever made,positive
"It's pretty clear from the first few moments of the film that it is easily one of the top three movies off all time. It's just an all time classic. Marlon Brando dominates the screen but repeat viewings reveal Pacino to be the real star, although the performances of the entire cast are spot on. The scene in the restaurant is one of my favourite movie moment ever, alongside the baptism scene.",positive
"One of the best movies of all time. Phenomenal cast, phenomenal story.",positive
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Brilliant!!!,positive
"touche, took me a while to finally see it but it was a hell of a good movie",positive
Considered of the best movies of all time for a good reason.,positive
"one of the best films of all time. story of the corleone mafia family. "" i'll make him an offer he can't refuse""",positive
"A classic. The last movie, I hear, to be shot in technicolour. So the colours practically leap off the screen. Like the funeral scene with black suits, and a single red rose in the distance. Al Pacino is fascinating to watch...I re-watch this just for him. Wow.",positive
I did not care for the Godfather. It insists upon itself. Just kidding. It was great!,positive
EXCELENTE! REALMENTE ME FASCINA,positive
"Es una pelÃ­cula impresionante, cada vez que la veo puedo hacer distintas lecturas ...",positive
"la mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos....asi de simple, y mis actores favoritos en un inicio de saga realmente espectacular",positive
"Wanted to see it for so long, heard so many good things about it. And it delevers on all of them. The movie was very long, about 3 hours, but it goes by fast. There is a lot to follow in the plot and the movie keeps you on your toes to follow the story. The acting is also great, Pacino is amazing as is Brando, the rest of the star studded cast follow suit. Franciis Ford Coppola delivers the ""godfather"" of all mobster movies, everyone should see this movie. It is a classic.",positive
"brandos best performence, coppolos best film, and one of the best movies ever.",positive
I can't belive i waited this long to sit and watch the whole series. The first one and the first half of the second are by far the absolute best cinematography ever!,positive
The best mafia film ever.didn't take a fancy to the last one tho.,positive
"la mejor,,,una de mis preferidas la veo cien veces y iempre me entretengo",positive
"MUSIC, SCENES, CHARACTORS, ACTING, STORY LINE.... PERFECT!!!!",positive
"i had very high expectations when watching this, its a great film nicely shot and good script has some patchy acting but that doesn't overshadow the fact that its but an enjoyable film",positive
"i think this is the best movie/trillogy ever, exelent editing, story line.. exelent.. this is my favorite move of all time and i dont think thats going to change",positive
The book was truly great and the first in the triologyn is the best. Al Paciono is soo good. //Charlotte,positive
The coolest movie ever. Pacino and Brando give their best performance,positive
A great movie. Period.,positive
"Um pretty cool,kinda hard to keep up with but gotta luv the shooting and stuff lol.and that one guy is kinda cute. ;)",positive
One of the best mob film EVER!!,positive
Whoa! Awesome movie.,positive
Storytelling at its best. Francis Ford Coppola created a cinematic masterpiece and showed the world the acting chops of Al Pacino before he was the hardass we all know and love.,positive
"love the all,but brando in this pure class",positive
"Greatest Crime drama ever made. It was Brando's best not to mention Pacino. Coppola did an excellent job in glamourizing the life of the Italian mafia. it leaves you on the edge always wanting more, the baptism scene is genius. If you love movies this is a must see.",positive
"Can I add another star? With the exception of #3, the first two are one of the greatest pieces of American cinema ever!",positive
"Brilliant everyone really needs to see this one, just to see a film that truely is a masterpiece",positive
"A true achievement in every sense, and exceptional in all aspects of film.",positive
"This is one of the best films ever made - amazing cast, brilliant director and an outstanding storyline. Watch all three you wont be disappointed",positive
A movie I can't refuse 5 stars to.,positive
"To be shallow for a minute...Al Pacino was reallt hot in this. Diane Keaton was wow. Marlon Brando...I don't even really need to say, the voice! I think the movie was really well done and...I'm trying to think of what I had to say about it, but the HORSE thing. Stuck.",positive
"A classic. A masterpiece. I just adore this film. Casting is brilliant, dialogues, photography and the superb music...",positive
La mejor pelicula que he visto...simplemente IMPRESIONANTE!!!,positive
"Le top, me regarde les 3 quand je suis malade, Ã§Ã  fait une bonne journÃ©e Don Corleone..",positive
one of the greatest movies of all time,positive
"Wot can u say bout this., there are no words. 2nd is even better.",positive
Ar dar reikia ka sakyti? Juk tai sedevras,positive
Brando in one of the best performances of all time,positive
"There's a reason every character and scene in this movie has been imitated and referenced to the point of cliche. Classic, through and through with nary a negative aspect to be found.",positive
"""I'm gonna make him an offer he cannot refuse..."" <--- :)",positive
I believe in america... America has made my fortune... What else ?,positive
"All time classic. Marlon Brando dominates the screen but repeat viewings reveal Pacino to be the real star, although the performances of the entire cast are spot on. The scene in the restaurant is my favourite movie moment ever.",positive
"my favourite movie of all time, i love the drama, love and passion",positive
there aint more stars?,positive
"FANTASTIC!!! I made an effort to see all three the movies, one following the other, and yes, it took a while, but man, it is more than worth it!!! Marlon brando is an exquisite actor, not mentioning Al Pacino, or Robert Duvall",positive
"What words can describe such a milestone epic but""The Best of it's genre""",positive
i can watch all 3 parts over and over and over and over and over again,positive
An all time great. Classic.,positive
All time Fave!! The CORLEONE FAMILY RULES,positive
"Everything a good movie should be and more. Stunning performances, gritty (for its time) action, a gripping story line and superb acting.",positive
"why do people like godfather? well for one, characters are pretty badass, and yet theres more character development than bang, you're dead, you get deeper into the characters.",positive
Don Vito is history ......,positive
I'm not into gangster movies but this one is pretty good. A lot better than Scarface (1983).,negative
"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,, The greatest movie of all times",positive
greatest movie ever?,positive
Marlon Brando doing his thing,positive
"You cannot possibly over-rate this film. Perhaps the greatest of all time, any genre, any style.",positive
The rise of Michael Corleone.,positive
"Wonderfuly enthralling and atmospheric, a true celluloid gem enhanced by a superb cast. Coppola's pace of direction and haunting musical score creates an almost fly-on-the-wall insight into a Mafia family. Parts 1 & 2 are flawlessly joined - unequalled in its genre.",positive
Simplemente la mejor de todas las pelÃ­culas,positive
i love this series i could watch it almost daily....don't ask why but its the best,positive
The best movie ever.,positive
"I watched this movie today, and it instantly becomes one, if not my favorite movie of all time. The story is so good and the acting, most notably Pacino and Brando is perfect. I loved this movie and can't wait to watch the sequels.",positive
"Good movie. Exciting, but there is still a lot of talk in it. Overall, it's worth taking the time to watch.",positive
"This movie is wonderful. Francis Ford Coppola is a great...no EXCELLANT directer. Mario Puzo has a great vision for a movie as well as his novel which this movie is based off of. It also has a great cast(I can&amp;#039;t believe how young Talia Shire is!),but most importantly this is a masterpiece and is SHEER GENIUS!!! I DEFINETELY RECOMMEND WATCHING THIS. YOU WON&amp;#039;T BE DISAPOINTED!!! One of the greatest films ever made!!! Another fact is that Al Pacino is so CUTE in this movie!!!",positive
Wanderful with a word!This is favorite film!!!,positive
"A great movie. Watching it has become almost a landmark event in a man's life. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.",positive
masterpiece Al pacino is a monster here and in the second,positive
no comment monsieur coppola,positive
People would kill me if I were to give this less than 4.5 stars.,positive
"Great cast, great film, and truly an epic story. This illustrates the essence of organized crime and shows how a family involved with it can struggle between the desire to be normal and an ongoing thirst for power once it has been tasted.",positive
GF and GFII the best 5 hours on film,positive
Don't know what the fuss is all about. I enjoyed the Departed more than i enjoyed this marathon of a movie.,negative
The greatest movie of all times. Story somewhat trimmed compared to the novel but still it makes the impact courtesy the brilliant acting of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.,positive
It gets better with each viewing.,positive
Great cinematic achievement. Very touching story.,positive
What is it with men and this movie??!,positive
There's a reason it's so famous. Absolutely stunning film.,positive
"From start to finish, a great movie. Good directing on an epic story, awesome casting, and despite how long the running time never gets boring.",positive
"Finally sunk in recently how truly great this and GF II are. So much detail, nuance, and artistry but not 'arty', and tremendously entertaining. Not a glorification, a depiction of the tragic corruption at the heart of the American Dream.",positive

"9.1/10 The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes. A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are. I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together. I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them. Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy",positive

A picture that set the tone for all future gangster films,positive
You just can't top the Godfather. enough said,positive
Althouht i don`t like the sicilian way of life this is very well made film. Too slow for younger generations i guess.,positive
One of the best films of all time!,positive
"absoulutely incredible. i can't say anything that hasn't already been said about this movie, since it is, without a doubt, the greates movie ever made",positive
One of the great Pacino/Brando/Coppola movies,positive
Good movie?Sure.Best movie of all time?Hmmm...,positive

Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in the mob. Need I say more?,positive
Anyone who hasnt watched this movie its better for him to stop reading this review and stand up and go to the nearst video store and rent it or even better buy it.Best movie of all times and thats it......,positive
all i can say is its my no.1,positive
"Probabally one of the best films ever made, some of the finest acting I'v ever witnessed, The Godfather of all other gangster movies.",positive
"My all time favorite movie...of all time! Starring the greatest actor to ever be filmed on screen, Marlon Brando! There is not one bad preformance in this entire movie! Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire. They are all excellent! I always call this the video bible for men! It is the film that teaches a man how to be a man. It is the Mobster movie of all mobster movies! Did I mention it is the greatest movie ever made?",positive
It's the i Ching of the movies!,positive
"seeing Michael turned to a cold heart mafia boss from an innocent and lovely boy,it really breaks your heart and amazed the great,superb performance of Al Pacino.HE IS GOD",positive
the begginig of the best mafias movies,positive
"This film felt like it was about ten minutes long - before I knew it nearly three hours had gone past. Personally I found it a bit hard to keep track of who all the characters were, but that might just be because i was watching it at 2am. This film really is essential viewing.",positive
Here it all starts.... One of the best movies ever...,positive
"Brando, Caan, and Duvall. Don't get any better that this. Tied for my favorite Brando flick.",positive
can i give it ten stars please?,positive
2nd best movie ever!,positive
watch it. period. end.,positive
"Fantastic, slightly less enjoyable then part II, but by a slim margin.",positive
GREATEST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN!!!,positive
An offer you cant refuse,positive
Suuuper Woooowwwwwww,positive
I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. If you havent seen this film watch it now and if you dont own this film buy it now. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ive ever seen and even if you dont like mob movies you must still see this.,positive
It's taken me a long time to catch up with this flic. I don't think it's lost anything over the years. Still a great story. Dramatic and powerful.,negative
"You can easily see why this film is so acclaimed. I don't usually notice how good the acting is in a movie, but the acting in this movie was extrodinary. The scene that really stood out to me, and still stands out to me throughout all Hollywood, is where Michael has to kill the 2 men in the restaurant. I noticed in that scene that as I watched Michael essentially turn to the dark side, I noticed that my heart was pumping much faster than a normal resting heart rate. The first time I saw it was an amazing experience. This is the ultimate ""love the bad guy"" movie and that's what makes it so good. My vote: 9.",positive
"This movie sucks! I'm sorry, but it does.",negative
"what can i say, the cotton really did the trick...",positive
The greatest mafia saga,positive
This is the best movie ever made.,positive
The greatest movie i have ever seen . Gives u an idea how a family is supposed to be .,positive
the godfather of all gangster movies. thats why its called the godfather. DUR~!! only one drawback...they shouldve stopped after the second one... fyi...4.5 stars is for the entire series only cause godfather 3 sucked nads,positive
"Without a dout the pinnacle of American film production, 100% flawless and thats over three hours. Everything to the tiniest detail in this movie is perfect. A few have come close but none have been able beat this mob classic.",positive
"Las tres peliculas son buenisimas... pero en verdad me sorprende la conduccion del guion, la dreccion, las actuaciones... lo mejorrrrr",positive
I luv every GodFather movie ever made. This one had me wanting to grow up and join the MOB when I was 7yrs old,positive
"Marlon Brand, Al Pacino, James Cann, Who else do you need? This film is gonna be the one of the best films all the time. Its not only a gangster films but also its the sotry of men who tried to protect their family. I will ask my son or whoever my offspring to put in my coffien this fimls DVD or Blu-ray or whatever its called the Audio system when I die.",positive
Classic mafia film...Tho u need to have patience to sit an watch the whole trilogy to get the whole picture of just how good these films are...,positive
The best movie I've ever seen,positive
"No contest, everybody is awesome in this great story of a crime familly, the adaptation from Puzo's book to the big screen is to good for words, story telling at its best",positive
It has to be one of the best movies ever made. I introduced to several other people and said they have never saw it and they love it! So all those 3 starred reviews are unacceptable. If you knew you werent gonna like it or you gave that because it was TOO long well shame on you. You should have been paying attention to the characters and the story line. That is where the movie is great and of course the violence too lol.,positive
"A cult classic, what all films should be based on.",positive
Best movie ever... no doubt what so ever,positive
"Absolutely Classic! Everythin.. script, story, cinematography so brilliant!",positive
Absolutaly brilliant great story line and good to watch.,positive
its the Godfather1!!,positive
wow!!thats whats all i can say about this masterpiece....a whooping 5 star movie!!!!,positive
whaddya talkin about,positive
There is one and one alone -papi in La Familia:),positive
"one of the most greatest movies made, al pacino and marlon brado one of the best actors, i re-watch this movie every month",positive
"Mob movies dont get any better than this. A truly incredible story based on Mario Puzos novel, one of the best casts and acting ever to see the big screen and has more memorable movie scenes and quotes than any other movie I can think of.",positive
"The best movie of all time, nothing more to be said. The only movie that even comes in the same league is Part 2",positive
"You notice how when a few people claim something is the best ever it just snowballs into a lot of hype and all faults are overlooked. This is one of those movies. Its nearly 3 hours but the lag time makes it feel even longer and Brando is nearly impossible to understand. Its an interesting crime story but not all that its cracked up to be. Like so many ""classics"" watch it at least once to see what the fuss is about.",negative
greatest movie in my book,positive
"Considered as one of the greatest movies ever made. I don't completely agree, but I liked it too. Thumbs up.",positive
This movie is a little overrated...but all in all Marlon Brando and Al Pacino did a good job!,positive
The Godfather of movies? Definitly!,positive
una de las mejores peliculas de la historia,positive
BEST GANGSTER FILM EVER MADE NOWT ELS GETS CLOSE,positive
Great classic! See it!,positive
"flot, underholdende, bare Ã¦rligt den ikke er lÃ¦ngere....den her film er kopiret og efterlignet i snart 40 Ã¥r! ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" er nok en af de mest brugte. SE DEN",positive
possibly the best movie of all time?,positive
"Talk about a movie with a lot of hype surrounding. I was worried it wouldn't live up to its hype, because that happens to me a lot, which is why I didn't like 300 or never watched Borat. Hype ruins movies. Anyway, this movie lives up to its hype and surpasses it, by a lot. One of the greatest films ever made.",positive
"The score is good and the movie is cool, but I'm not changing my panties over it.",negative
I didn't really care for it.,negative
"greatest film ever, no doubt in my mind",positive
The Godfather Trilogy is the best of all trilogies... never get sick of watching it. I wish that I could find a man that could actually sit through the whole trilogy...,positive
Al Pacino is my favorite but I really didn't care for this one much... I should probably re-watch it.,negative
A decade of one family's criminal empire with an all-star cast!,positive
"""I have a movie, you can't refuse....""",positive
"Leave the guns, take the cannoli.",positive
"One of the best movies of all time, belongs in every collection.",positive
"Classic mafia film that I have finally seen after years of wanting to. I will finally understand all of the cultural references that have emerged from this film. A great script, acting, plot and lots of suspense and intrigue. Roll on Part 2 now!",positive
A great mafia movie and by far the best.,positive
Exceptional. Possibly the greatest Gangster film ever made.,positive
"Incredible piece of filmmaking. The characters were all engrossing, (Brando's Don Vito is a masterpiece) the cinematography totally unique, and the music classic. A must see!",positive
"This is the greatest movie ever made. Brando at his best! Vito Corleone: ""Bonasera... Bonasera... What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? Had you come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day.""",positive
...did you see the Godfather Superbowl commercial with the Audi car. Funny!,negative
a classic. whoever doesn't like this movie...well...they obviously need serious psychiatric help,positive
best movie ever made.,positive
"Its a right of passage to any man. ""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse."".....watch the movie",positive
Not a better one even if I watch another 1.000.000 films...,positive
Everyone should see this movie.,positive
Watch this movie. It is amazing.,positive
the best movie of all time,positive
"Truth be told I did not like this movie very much, I fell asleep after the first hour, woke up an hour later and just didn't give a crap so I shut it off.",negative
The definitive mafia film and a film that everyone should see at least once. Surpassed as a mob movie only by it's sequel. Brando as Don Corleone is superb as is Al Pacino as Michael. Great storyline and fantastic cinematography combine to make this one of the all time greats.,positive
BEST MOVIE EVER PERIOD,positive
Best movie ever made and possibly ever will be made. You can't beat it.,positive
"Marlon Brando has the aura of a real Mafia, slow-talking, self-assured. I won't be surprised if people took him for a real mafia. We could also see the devil coming out in Al Pacino when he shot the sheriff and the other guy in the restaurant, I believe there are no other better candidates than Al Pacino and he fully justified it. The best of the trilogy.",positive
Perhaps the greatest story ever told,positive
Saw It More Than 30 TimeZ .. The # 1 Movie In The World.,positive
The God of all mobster movies.,positive
"a film that turn a boy into a man, a Saviour in order of a family...",positive
The complete trilogy is a masterpiece! Thrilling! Intriguing!,positive

"Great, classic movie.",positive
One of the best moives you will ever see.,positive
This is the best movie I have ever seen,positive
An absolute classic and must-see for all. The gradual transformation of michael into the godfather is subtle and perfect. (i underline subtle because that's definitely not a normal description of pacino).,positive
"Excellent!!! I watch this movie twice a year. The more often I watch it, the more I love it. Bravo!!!",positive
I never really liked this movie.,negative
Thank yoooouuu Hollywood!,positive
the best of the three...classic baby,positive
It insists upon itself,positive
"This is the best movie I have ever seen. It lives up to every hype that has been said about it. Anyone who says that it doesn't is either being cynical and searching for weaknesses that aren't there, or simply does not know what a good movie is. It's long, but necessarily so. Any shorter cut would have been an injustice. The perfect movie.",positive
amazing...absolutely amazing.,positive
the best movie ever no arguement,positive
How could you not enjoy watching the Godfather movies,positive
"This is an incredible movie. This is one of the few ""perfect"" movies. Every actor performed at their best. This is the best mafia movie ever made. Francis Ford Coppola's Masterpiece.",positive
"a great movie, great actors and just a great movie",positive
"Most viewers would instantly asume that it is a film only about mafia, when in fact it is also a film about family and the choices that have to be made to protect it. It's always going to be considered one of those ""best movies ever"".",positive
Both the book and the movie are wonderful,positive
"The best actors, great storyline, great music, one of the BEST films ever !",positive
"Great film. Powerful, complex and brilliantly acted. Deservedly rated as the best ganster movie ever.",positive
The father of great mafia movies.,positive
"""Don't forget the cannoli.""",positive
A must for all film buffs.,positive
I can't even begin to review a film of this scope in a space this small. Probably the closest to perfection any film has ever come.,positive
"The classic mob story about family, revenge, and succession. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Robert Duvall lead the extraordinary cast.",positive
Greatest movie of all time! Nuff said.,positive
one the most influential films of all time,positive
Good movie a classic of mobster television.,negative
"The standard for 'Mob Movies', nothing better! Brando and Pacino at their very best!",positive

Probably the best movie ever,positive
"Words can't do this justice, but it can't get in my top 10 even though it's in the rest of the world's.",positive
Classic gangster movie by Coppola. 2 generations of Godfather have shown the difference of handling and the lines of Al Pacino have became the bible of all business. Best of mafia movie.,positive
The GREATEST MOVIE of all time!!!,positive
"MADE ME WISH I WAS ITALIAN, PLUS ITS AN EXCELLENT FILM",positive
"An intriguing epic. Nothing is bigger, nothing is badder. Coppola portrays the Mafia on such a high scale, the movie itself is a realistic commentary on organized crime.",positive
Wow! Mon prÃ©fÃ©rÃ© des trois! Marlon Brando surpuissant!!!,positive
"Very good movie. If you don't like it, you'll end up like Luca...""He sleeps with the fishes.""",positive
"One of the best reality-type action movies out there. Very well planned out, very well acted. An overall brilliant movie.",positive
"this is the kind of classic that only comes along once every thirty years or so. a great, great film. No need to even go further than that. this movie speaks for itself. and its too hard to single out the aspects that make this movie legendary. there are too many of them.",positive
One of the greatest American films of all time.,positive

"the ""suits every mood I'm in"" movie",positive
My all time favorite movie....,positive
Every second of this movie is pure perfection(overlooking Sonny raping Carlo). Unforgettable and classic in every aspect. One of the greatest casts assembled all time. Enchanting and haunting score. Easily the greatest movie of all time. If you wish to contest that then you clearly have no inkling of what you are talking about.,positive
la mejor pelicula de toda la historia indiscutiblemente,positive
"The #1 film about the mafia had lost none of it's power over the years. If anything it's gotten better with age. For all it's crime and violence, the facinating thing is that this really is a movie about family, and the importance of sticking with your family no matter what. You can't be a film lover and not have seen this.",positive
Definitely a classic although I like Godfather 2 more.,positive
The greatest film ever made in my opinion.,positive
"Brilliant, classic. What more can you say?",positive
classic classic......,positive
1 of the best movies ever made,positive
The most accomplished and perfect film ever made. Amazing at every level.,positive
"One of the greatest movies of all time for a reason. Pitch perfect from the writing, directing, score, cinematography and casted perfectly. I could not think of another movie that could garner a stronger recommendation from me.",positive
"Not quite up to par with what Goodfellas brings to the table, but all in all it is a true classic. Plus, Al Pacino gives the performance that launches him into the Hollywood eye.",positive
Cinematic perfection. Pachino's best role.,positive
"leave the gun, take the cannoli",positive
"classic. pure classic. its hard to hate on this movie. from excellent screenplay to amazing writing, this movie is no doubt one of the greatest movies of all time",positive

My all time favorite,positive
Need I say more...Beautiful...,positive
"Suspenseful, funny (in places), and immensely sad. A great piece of filmmaking.",positive
best movie of all time,positive
"I really don't get what there is to like... it was boring, uneventful, drawn out, completely out-dated...",negative
"""Where does it say that you can't kill a cop?""",positive

Whooo.... Full of Legends,positive
Greatest movie of all time!,positive
bra fimer alle samme mÃ¥ ses!,positive
"As film history goes, I dont think there will be anything bigger or better than this from Hollywood....ever. Whilst the roles of the leading actors like Brando, Pacino and James Caan have been eulogied on for long, dont miss out on the fabulous part played by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen.....essentially understated and riveting!!",positive
Some the best performances in movie history. If you ask me every family should take notes from the Corleones; and this movie gets me cuz I gotta a friend named sonny:),positive
great classic movie no one in thier right mind cna say this movie is cak,positive
Marlon Brando siempre sera el padrino por excelencia,positive

The single best movie ever made!,positive

"""an all-time favorite...""",positive
"classic, found it very interesting",positive
"Magnific! No words, as a classic deserves.",positive
aqui hay muchos avemaria,positive
"This is one of very few cinemas that have all the ingredients to be a class movie. Plots, actors, directors, story details.... The whole story was well crafted. It has been long while since I saw it first time. Lately I saw the rerun on AE channel. Still love it. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, and Abe Vigoda. Who are not great actresses or actors?",positive

"A good story, but as with most films of the 1970s, I can't help but feel that it could have used an edit. Sure, it's a sweeping epic of the family, but I felt that the plot could have been tightened up a little bit. Perhaps I would have better perspective if I had read Puzo's book first.",negative

No entiendo como es la pelicula mejor calificada de IMDb; realmente no lo entiendo. De entrada, tiene millones de errores secuenciales y eso es algo que no aguanto en el cine. Vamos, todas tienen, pero cuando es obvio, no lo perdono con facilidad a menos que la pelicula sea los suficientemente buena (en su resto) como para opacar este tipo de cosas.",negative

"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
nothing to say... cant make a movie better than this,positive
"The first and the best of the series. Italian Americans take note, this is a refined movie about the underbelly of the beast that is the mafia, a creature that consumes and ultimately destroys everything it touches in a Faustian hubris. Translation = Only an idiot thinks they'll come up a winner in the long run by getting involved with organized crime. If you're in bed with the mafia, you are doomed.",positive
"Classic, tho not the best imo, it was still a good film",positive

i can't ever seem to watch this movie enough.,positive
"the benchmark of all underworld mafia movies, Mario Puzzo's masterpiece! the first episode of the trilogy, and the best i consider by far. mind tingling, intriguing, puzzling plot, and perfect casting. must see for all movie freaks, but make sure you have enough snacks and coke to accompany you during that long hours of movie.",positive

The Mafia of Mafia films!,positive
"Great, but it's just to hard to get into.",positive
"Unbearably slow, incredibly boring, and containing a predictable plot, the only reason people love this is because they're told to. If it came out tomorrow, it would be panned across the board, but it's not going to.",negative
I love the story of this movie. Al is not yet part of the family's business but at the end of the story he avenge the death of his father.,positive
The 1srt and by far the best of the trilogy.,positive
"u come to me, on the day of my daughter's wedding...",positive
I FINALLY saw this movie and I'm glad a did. Everyone talks about Scarface and Godfathers together but this was way better than scarface.,positive
the second one was better,positive
IT SAYS IT 4 IT SELF,positive
"Taken together, Godfather 1 and 2 are probably the Great American Movie.",positive
"Brando,DeNiro,Pacino...Masterpiece!",positive
Pretty much the greatest movie ever!,positive
"A Masterpiece. This film from first line of dialogue to first and final image is, without a doubt, one for the ages. To sum it up, this is a film about America. From its analysis of power, its uses, its limits and its corrupting influence to its masterfully written characters and near- perfect narrative drive it is an epic with no peer. I love the film's focus on the family as its central thematic concern, a radical break with the megalomaniacal gangster-type of the past. I also admire its representation of evil as a series of dimly lit deals made in back rooms and the gradual and credible descent of Michael from idealist to Don. Lastly, it offers a searing critique of the destructive power of capitalism. A Classic Work of ART!",positive
unbelieveble movie!!!!,positive
Simpelthen fantastisk,positive
One of my favourites!,positive
"What can be said about this movie other th an it's a classic, that term is used too often but this film truly is one of the greatest films ever made",positive

Classic movie. One of the few that can hold my attention for three hours!,positive
Marlon Brando. James Caan. Al Pacino. Diane Keaton. Add a thrilling plot and you've got the best gangster film ever.,positive
I dont like the Godfather movies. So kill me.,negative
"classic. thats all i have to say. coppola does an excellent job of maintaining the muted lethality of mario puzzo's greatest novel. He treats the themes of family and business with equal respect. if your looking for a mindless bloodbath, go see hard boiled instead. if you want to see excellent acting all around and completely engrossing story right down to the final minute, this is a classic you can't go wrong with.",positive
this is a fine piece of art. great performances by Brando and Pacino. a lot of memorable scenes. and it just gets better with the second film.,positive

A classic. Everyone should watch this movie at least once. The directing and cinematography is some of the best i have ever seen; the only rival for Citizen Kane around.,positive
"could be one of the best movies of all time, performances and cinematography",positive
Una Pelicula Excelente.,positive
How can you not love this movie?,positive
"IncreÃ­ble pelicula. Noten el cambio en la personalidad de Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), cuando matan a Apollonia y se hace cargo del puesto de su padre. En 2 palabras... IM PRESIONANTE!",positive
Finally got around to seeing the Godfather series absolutely brilliant!,positive
"Le film n'a pas pris une ride. Marlon Brando creve l'ecran. Il n'y a pas eu de meilleur VRP depuis pour la Mafia Sicilienne (a part,peut-etre, la famille Soprano) Adieu Don Corleon.",positive
"After so long I finally watched it. It was good but admit I had trouble following some of it, following some of the characters.",positive
epic. but that everyone says..,positive
Incredible story. Incredible characters. Incredible performances. A perfect movie.,positive
"The greatest character transformation in history, excluding Hamlet perhaps. It's scary because you know Michael doesn't simply become dark, he's always had the darkness inside him. It's family. The film is tense, tender, brutal and funny, with the finest resolution I'm yet to encounter",positive
Back when Al Pacino talked softly. Great story and setting.,positive
"My Favorite Movie, period. A flawless film. The series made Al Pacino a legend.",positive

Pacino teaches film acting school on screen. Pay attention and you'll see it.,positive
Greatest movie ever made.,positive
very fantastc film Ä± ike movie,positive
These movies were AWESOME!!!,positive
"I never could get into the story, or the characters, so this was not a favorite of mine. In fact, after watching it, I deleted Parts 2 and 3 from my DVR, because I wasn't that interested any more. I can appreciate it for the acting and film quality, but not my kind of movie.",negative
classic! the godfather of all gangster movies,positive
Two words: Michael Corleone. :),positive
the movie was excellent..but the book is still better,positive
Awsome!!!!!!!! Marlon Brando is god.,positive
The one that started it all!,positive
this movie is the SHIT!!,positive
Classic. Goes without saying. Where's the dead fish?,positive
the 3 movies are superb,positive
it took me a long time to finally watch these but all three are classic epic films. Al Pacino is brilliant and it great to watch him grow through the trilogy.,positive

It was grate but not realy ma thing!,positive
I'm a bit of a Godfather freak. It's gonna be the Sicilian in me.,positive
Hands down my favorite of ALL TIME,positive
"The baptism scene is still one of the great singular achievements in film editing ever. I used to think that Pacino's character arc displayed great range, now I think his shift is a bit too abrupt, but the overall performance is really amazing. And this has just become one of if not the most significant films in the American pop cultural imagination that everyone should see it.",positive
Sin duda una de las mejores pelÃ­culas de la historia del cine.,positive
this movie is something like a legend in the international Cinema movies the great cast the great story the great idea want to explain this movie simply make me say my favorite movie is The God Father,positive
Clearly one of the best movies of all time.,positive
I watch all 3 of them over and over!,positive
five stars does not do it justice,positive
classic....must watch for everyone!,positive
"This movie represents the ideal situation of the italian mafia that existed in the mid 1900s in america. The movie focuses on the character of michael corleone who is played by Al Pacino, who is one my favourite actors, he is represented as a gentle and kind person, untill things got rough around the edges with his father which turned him into a monster wit h no mercy...",positive
"I want to be ""Don Corleone""",positive
"Hands down the best movie of all time, no challenge",positive
A movie that represents every aspect of life. Truely amazing.,positive
"Masterpiece, if you're a guy who loves movies about the mafia like myself. Ladies never have and never will appreaciate it's appeal! hah sorry for my shovenism, but it's renownly categorized as a guy-movie.",positive

wELcoME to tHE fAmiLia!!!,positive
"You found paradise in America. You had a good trade, made a good living, the police protected you and there were courts of law and you didn't need a friend like me. But, now you come to me and you say ""Don Corleone, give me justice."" But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. That line alone makes this the best movie ever.",positive

It will always remain as one of the greatest films ever. The story is timeless and every character is extremely memorable. Al Pacino's journey in this film is unbelievable.,positive
"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.",positive
this is one of the greatest films ever made. watch it.,positive

Un film culte. La prestation de Brando restera inoubliable,positive
bir mafya ailesi bu kadar karizma olabilir...,positive
"What an incredible ride this movie is. Marlon Brando is a vehicle for this movie, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale are incredible, Al Pacino is in a world of his own, Diane Keaton is brilliant. The dialogue, the lighting, the art direction, the music, everything makes this movie stand out",positive
"And God said to Coppola, ""You shall have heavy-handed symbolism, but you shall also have the most excellent actors to save your ass."" And it was good.",positive
All time favourite! =0>,positive
best movie of all times,positive

"The spawn of 8,000,000 MySpace comments between me, Danny, and Rick.",positive
"This movie is shot in shadows, and it makes you lean in to the screen to see what's in the dark. Then, it sucks you into the shadowy world of the family, and the growing darkness in the heart of the main character.",positive
Plain and simple: a masterpiece.,positive
Greatest movie ever made! The whole cast was brilliantly selected by Francis Ford Coppola. Definitely a must see!,positive
My favorite movie of all time,positive
The Godfather series is the best movie series. Period.,positive
If u have not seen dis. U have no gangsta in U. So dont front,positive
the daddy of them all,positive
Godfather is about as close yo a perfect film (on every level) as you are ever likely to see.,positive
Best movie ever made.,positive
BEST MOVIE EVER. Enough said.,positive
One of the greatest movies ever made. End of story.,positive
"Sin mas, ""La mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos"".",positive
"What can I say--despite the incessant Italian-American stereotypes it spawned, the film is one of, possibly the greatest ever made. From the writing to the acting to the cinematography to the music, a gem of near perfection. And the Baptism scene is one of the greates film sequences in history.",positive
"One of the best movies of all time. Francis Ford Coppola hasn't made a movie I hate yet. Al Pacino is excellent as Michael Corleone, the one family member who doesn't want to see anybody sleeping with the fishes. Robert Duvall is great and James Caan has one of the bloodiest death's I've seen in a while. And best of all, only guys seem to love this movie, it's the best way to get the girls away from us (I'm just kidding girls, you know we love you!)",positive
One of the best movies of all time.,positive
i don' t know who didn't see the godfather but great movie great actors to,positive
A must watch and an excellent entertainer,positive
al pacino. They dont make em like that anymore!,positive
just the best thriller.,positive
Is it everything it's made out to be? Maybe not. But you can't deny Pacino and Brando.,positive
"Truely amazing, read the book, it's even better, seriously is.",positive
The best classic mob.,positive
what can i say my all time fav movie along with the other 2,positive
A classic in every sense of the word with some of the best scenes ever commited to film. The Baptism scene is at least in my top fifteen favorite scenes of all time.,positive
one of my faves...all 3 of dem!!,positive
No Movie will ever compare....,positive
"Fantastic movie, all star cast and some fantastic acting. Legendary",positive
There is no better movie.,positive
"I don't care what people say, this is far better than the second.",positive
BEST CLASSIC EVER!!!!,positive
There is nothing I can say about the greatest drama of all time that hasn't already been said.,positive
Haha yes the hairy Sonny is classic.,positive
This is definitely a Legend,positive
Probably 1 of the best movies ever. Made even better by watching Steve and Harry play the game.,positive
i hoped that this movie would be not so cool. but i was wrong. the plot and the making were breathholding. i loved vitto corleonee,positive
"Sometimes all of life feels like a ""hitting the mattresses"" zone",positive
"THE Movie. I think I have watched it about eight times... The first scene, where Buonassera talks to Don Corleone, is just too good.",positive
"Amazing, Super, Emotional!",positive
marlon brandos best ever acting role,positive
"I heard a lot abt this movie but when i watched it, it turned out be better than anythng i had ever expected......",positive
"fantastic! love the story, the setting, the actors.",positive
An offer you shouldn't refuse...,positive
"Fascinating. A very quick 3 hours. Breathtaking storytelling, perfect acting, makes you fall in love with cinema with every viewing.",positive
Classic. Must see. This movie started it all.,positive
"I agree with Brian Poladian. if you didn't like this movie, I'd be insulting rocks if I equated you with them.",positive
never should have hired an irishman,positive
Best movie ever!!!!!!!!!,positive
the second part is better.,positive
"If you haven't seen this masterpiece then you are missing out. There is a reason why this movie and its sequel are my top two movies. Crime, murder, betrayal, and family.",positive
"Holy jeez. This movie, and also the two following it were great. Al Pacino looks amazing, and just....WOW. Such an interesting story for me.",positive
What can be said about this great film?,positive
okay so i watched the first two hours of it..then i fell asleep. (i tend to do that a lot),negative
"I could tell you about it, but then I'd have to...",positive
"If you have not seen this, you HAVE to. If you've seen this and you didn't like it...I'm sorry to say that you're an iddiot.",positive
A great story well told.,positive
Worthy of its ubiquitous god-ly level (intended pun) reviews.,positive
"movies as art. one of top five movies ever, what can one say about brandos performance ? pacinos ? duvalls ? the soundtrack haunts you. the pace is perfect, just the perfect film.",positive
Classic in the truest sense of the word.,positive
bu filme 5 yildiz vermiyenlerin ta aqqqqqq hemi,positive
"one of the best films ever made, brando is awsome if you dont own a copy then you should, you wont find a better mob movie ever",positive
make you an offer you can't refuse,positive
Not my thing. Interesting view of a poor man's rise to power.,negative
The best of the lot - Brando is magnetic,positive
The Godfather of all movies.,positive
"sometimes boring, sometimes good, but good, good...super.",positive
"Brilliant! Remember the days when even the gangsters had values? Getting whacked was ""strictly business"" - not just for the pure fun of it. Some of the best acting performances - incredible story line. I can watch it over and over and over ...",positive
Maybe best movie ever...It is as good as Shawshenk redemption,positive
This is my all time best!! Marlon Brando delivers a great performance!,positive
no doubts its the best movie of all time,positive
bring on the godfather...a must see if ure in2 the mafia style films..seen this 6times easy. a must see.,positive
A superior cinematic effort that shaped the way mobsters see themselves as much as informed society about the wickedness that dwells behind respectability. Unmissable.,positive
"Bravo,this is cinema",positive
The motherload of all gangster movies. One should not be allowed to progress other gangster movies until you've seen this one.,positive

great performance by Marlon Brando! he was just superb...but part II is still the best of the trilogy...,positive
"""Leave the gun. Take the canoli."" Enough said.",positive
my second five star award. coppola says it's a metaphor for the emergence of the multi-national corporation in the 70's.,positive
"Just an unbelievable movie. The acting is superb and the story layered. Every time I see it, I pick up something new that I never noticed before. The characters have such depth. This movie will leave you wanting to pay your respects to the Don.",positive
eeeaaaahhh...well lets face it a tad over-rated,negative
bit slow in parts but otherwaise truely awesome,positive
no comment!! because it's so good!!!!!,positive
The best movie ever made. There are 2 kinds of people in this world. Those who like Godfather and those who dont. The later definitely have no clue how to survive in this world,positive
The best movie ever made,positive
the best movie ever.......,positive
"Its a classic that everyone knows, whether they have seen it or not! Great Mob movie with good actors/acting and plenty of those famous scenes :)",positive
"No review needed, just watch it!",positive
I don't think you should even be allowed to watch movies until you've seen this one. It's just stunning.,positive
I loved the scenes in Italy...Best mafia/gangster movie I've seen.,positive
"After yeaaaars, I finally watched it. In Bandung! Talk about as FAR as the eyes can see, eh?",positive
I learn something everytime I watch this movie. Classic.. if u havn't seen it at least once your an ass,positive
"Like good bolognaise sauce, the secret to this film's success and lasting impression is that it takes its time to let the flavours of the story - that spans the decades of Mafia family life - sink into the soup and simmer just underneath boiling point. Coppola's slow, deliberate, but always fascinating and uneasy, objective eye towards the violent subject matter makes for a harrowing, but emotionally absorbing experience. Both Brando, Duvall and a young Al Pacino are great and the impeccably researched and authentic recreation of Italian-American life in the 1950's has to be seen to be believed. Leave the gun, take the canoli.",positive
Wow. Have I been missing out or what?,positive
"""The Best"" You will never get tired of watching...",positive
Five Stars. Because it's The Godfather. And it's got Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. And it's just about THE most amazing films I have ever seen. *Cues The Godfather Waltz*,positive
"Marlon Brando ,NO Doubt Is a Masterpiece Actor , The Movie Deserves His Place In The World Ranking Over The History #1",positive
"A great movie to watch. Everyone has to watch this movie. All the actors our in their best performance. First and Second one is my favourit, the ending for third one is soooo sad. you never get tired from watching this.",positive
"A beautifully selected cast makes Mario Puzo's novel ""The Godfather"" come to life. The viewer feels that they are part of the Corleone mob family as the family engages in triumphs and failures in 1930 New York.",positive
"amazing movie, classic mob movie, al pacino, marlon brando, james caan, robert duvall all r dominate in this movie, possibly the best mob movie of all time",positive
Black Humor Talking about the most brutal stuff with few bloody scene The best actor (Al Pacino) THe best ending (lies of Al Pacino) The best I have ever seen,positive
The greatest movie ever made. Ever.,positive
Absolute favorite (with Part 2)...not even close,positive
"Leave the gun, take the cannoli.",positive
What can be said? A true piece of art.,positive
The absolute best movie ever created!,positive
"It's the be all and end all of mafia movies. Everything about it is amazing, right down to the most miniscule detail. All in all, it is one of the best movies of all time. Total perfection.",positive
"marlon brando is amazing...i was worried that somewhere during a 3 hour movie i would get bored, but it never happened",positive
"If you only get to see 1 ganster film, this is the 1, just the sheer audacity of brando and pacino in the same film is overwhelming.",positive
I used to be in the camp that II is better but not any more. You can keep going back to this movie and still love it the same.,positive
"A great classic, I enjoyed the movie a lot even though it is not usually 'my thing' and I think this shows a lot about its character and plot.",positive
Marlon Brando i prefer his life more than that movie,positive
"The best film of all time ""I""ll make you an offer yoiu cant refuse ,if you choose to dis this film""!",positive
The movie that permanently placed the mob in my imagination. And therefore owns a little bit of my soul.,positive
"like i said, marlon brando is king. greatest movie of all time.",positive
"Great. I think it's mildly overrated. Brando is kind of annoying. Sometimes you want to scream ""Speak the hell up!"" There's also some underexposed scenes that are just too damn dark. Ultimately though, it's great. James Caan needs to be in more movies.",positive
Lets just forget they ever made a number 3 PLEASEEEEEE,positive
Le meilleur de toute la serie !!,positive
"Brando, Pacino ..Need I say more! The very best of the best",positive
"Not what I'd consider my kind of movie, and it moved slower than I expected, but good solid cinema and performances.",positive
The gangster movie all other gangster movies pine to be like (but can't seem to come close),positive
What do you say about one of the best movies ever made!,positive
Some day .... This is the best movie ever!,positive
one of best films ever made!,positive
Legendary. I can see it on so many gangster films.,positive
"Honestly I can't get past this movie without falling asleep. I don't get it! Last Don, Good Fellas, etc.. so much better than this",negative
"Amazing! A true classic mobster movie that is deep and real on so many levels. Can get a little confusing, but for those patient enough to sit through it, you will be rewarded with watching one of the greatest movie of all time.",positive
simply the best movie ever.,positive
"Impresionante, definitivamente una de las 5 mejores peliculas que he visto, Las actuaciones son magistrales, debo confesar que soy anti Pacino, pero por que habia empezado con alguna pelicula equivocada, desde hoy tiene un nuevo fan, Pero Marlon Brando con ese actuaciÃ³n Soberbia, que el mismisimo Sir Anthony Hopkins le debe envidiar aun despues de interpretar magistralmente al dr Lecter en el silencio de los inocentes. Si eres apasionado del cine no puedes perderte este clasico.",positive
an absolutely amazing movie that is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. every mafia movie made after the godfather triology is put against these movies to see how good they really are and only a handful make it close. a great movie all around,positive
probably one of the best movies ever made i agree marlon brando was brilliant and fantastic supporting cast,positive
What can I say? I watched this for a thousand times.,positive
i love all godfathers!!!!,positive
Pacino+ Brando= Incredible,positive
Probably the best gangster movie ever. Maybe just half a step down The Godfather II,positive
name a gangster epic better than this and ill buy u a car,positive
Its the God Father PLEASE!!!!,positive
This is the best movie ever!,positive
"Watch this movie million times and always love it.. ""lessons"" on loyalty and the ultimate revenge",positive
movie perfection. the definition of a masterpiece.,positive
Un des plus grands films du siecle pour moi et probablement de toute l'histoire du cinema. Un veritable chef-d'oeuvre,positive
"What can I say? Quite possibly the greatest movie of all time. I had the opportunity to see it at the Castro about 8 years ago. Experiencing it on a big screen was a treat, but it is just as satisfying on my home system. I never get tired of seeing it.",positive
The best film ever made ;),positive
The Best movie men ever created...,positive
brilliant-thats all that needs to be said,positive

"This brings out my inner Italian side. A must-see, Al Pacino is amazing.",positive
"All time cinetographic experience of Family, Business and betrayal",positive
One of the greatest films of all time.,positive
This movie is what separates the boys from the men,positive
the most popular greatest film of all time pick.,positive
"This is the film that defines the gangster genre. None of that Hays Code crap where we, the viewer, need to learn a moral lesson at the end. Power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely!",positive
Simply the greatest movie ever made.,positive
I could watch this movie again and again...,positive
Al Pacino is brilliant in all three!,positive
"Absolutly a classic and a must see. Marlon Brando and Pacino's acting is very good for those times, effects are still a bit week, but the story is to be told years ahead from now.",positive
Do i really have to say anything?,positive
There's no one like Marlon Brando,positive
"absolutely brilliant, enough said.",positive
"This movie made me an offer I could NOT refuse. And that movie was to watch it, or get a head in my bed. Just kidding man. I WORSHIP THIS MOVIE, better than Scarface, Carlito's Way and Boondock Saints",positive
"If your a real ""Gangsta"" you'll appreciate this",positive
"Book is better, but the movie is still amazing!",positive
"I know I should like this. But I fell asleep! Not my cup of tea then... However, all mafia movies owe to Godfather.",negative
"The best gangster film ever made, trust me, ive seen it a zillion times",positive
its a 5 star movie... need i say more?,positive
"god, i love marlon brando. ""stella!""",positive
"DON TIMMY SENDS HIS REGARDS, BTW, TATTAGLIA, BARZINI, CUNEO, STRACCI IS IN PAST, THERE IS THE CORLEONES!! don timmy ;p",positive
Never forget the family Fredo,positive
"THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!! I'm yet to see a movie as good as this! One can relate to the characters. Despite of the lives they lead, they're still human beings. Marlon Brando outshines as Don Vito Corleone!",positive
"Como se manejan, la ética y los códigos de honor no escritos en el mundo de la ilegalidad... y como el dinero y la ambición corrompen cualquier poder.",positive
"good, even though it's a guy movie. The score is amazing. I know I'm underrating it, but it's just not my constant cup of Tea. I'm glad I saw it... but that doesn't mean I'll see it again soon.",negative
The most amzing movie ever in the history of movies,positive
Mother of all movies.,positive
"The most epic movie ever made, Francis Coppola could have never guessed how great his movie would become",positive
"Absofuckenlutely amazing. I love this movie. Great acting, great plot, great cinematography... And I never knew it used to take so many bullets to kill someone. Great, great movie. Better than Boondock Saints.",positive

awesome simply awesome!!!!!!,positive
you may notice that in my fave films i tend to give them all very high ratings - THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE MY FAVOURITES! so sorry if my reviews not helping you much. this is the most classic ganster film ever. nuff said.,positive

"the godfather is the definition of the term mob movie, though the trilogy isnt my favorite of the genre.",positive
read the book and watch the movie then you can say you've lived life.,positive
Una de las mejores peliculas que he visto.,positive
This movie still rocks!,positive
"when I finally watched it, I loved it as I thought I would, looking forward to the rest of the series.",positive
"Quite epic. Dull sometimes. But all in all, not bad. Worth a viewing.",positive
Still the best Coppola movie ever.I've watched so often that I recite the lines along with the actors.,positive
"I saw this recently and thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. Great plot, characters, just everything. A movie that will be a classic in America for many years to come.",positive
Women just love bad boys...right Mr Corleone?!,positive
Great but the second one is my favorite,positive
I'm gonna make you an offer.,positive
This is quite simply the greatest movie ever made. Brilliant film-making that captures the essence of Puzo's book with perfect casting.,positive
What more can I say? One of the best movies of all time as far as I'm concerned even though it makes us Italians all seem like bad guys.,positive
Obra maestra solo eclipsada por su secuela.,positive

Easily one of the greatest movies of all time,positive
One of the best films ever made and a classic in the truest sense of the word.,positive
"""It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.""",positive
Once you start watching it on tv you can't stop,positive
"This is the first movie of the Godfather series. It is an introduction to the Corleone's Family Business and the Corleone family itself. Vito Corleone is the head of the family, Sonny Corleone is the temperamental elder brother, Fredo Corleone is the dumb with the good heart second brother and Micheal Corleone is the youngest and smartest among the brothers. While Connie Corleone is the naive younger sister. This movie is a great introduction to the Godfather series which is one of my favorite movie trilogy. However, I do feel that the sequel to this movie which is the Godfather Part II is a more superior movie.",positive
Godfather 2 was better but there wouldn't have been a sequel if not for this classic,positive
love it even though can't understand it,positive
"Very atmospheric backdrops lit by some of cinema's best actors, giving the performance of their careers. What cinema was invented for",positive
don't ever go against the family,positive
Great movie loved every second of it,positive
Your a damn fool not to like this movie. Best mob movie or movie for that matter.,positive
"Great movie, writing was good, characters were strong, and amazingly Al Pacino did very little yelling. It took me a long time to finally sit down and watch this movie, but I'm really glad I did.",positive
This movie's gonna live on longer than any of us,positive
Million years old - but a `must see` - just brilliant!,positive
"up there on my top ten list! ""I believe in america, america has made my fortune."" ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family isn't a real man at all.""",positive
Best movie ever made,positive
One of the world's finest action masterpiece ...,positive
The best movie ever. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando rocks :),positive
The Best Epic Ever Made (TM),positive
It took me 32 Years to see this but what a movie!,positive
iam always protected from these,positive
"Consistently, and accurately, rated as one of the best movies ever made.",positive
i love the music! and it's really classic!!,positive
"""The Godfather"" is considered by many to be the greatest movie of all time (others say it's ""Citizen Kane"") and it's easy to see why. This dark, wonderfully filmed gangster epic is, in my opinion, Marlon Brando's best film and one of Al Pacino's best as well. A truly great movie, and a cinema classic that will live forever.",positive
You can act like a man!,positive
Not my sort of film ...,positive
"IMDb's nr. 1, samme her!! Findes ikke bedre underholdning :-) Klassikeren over dem alle!",positive
Classic beneath the classics. The mother of gangsters movies. One of the greatest films of the last 40 years,positive
"Good. But not THAT good. Sorry, but that's how I feel.",negative
"One of the best classics, Al Pacino does a phenominal job in this movie I give it a five star rating!!!",positive
"this film is a damn legend with its cast, the most brilliant production about mafia in usa",positive
"marlon brando invento este personaje, de lo mejor que he visto",positive
"whoever puts a 4 star os less... must be the ""scary movie"" or ""american pie"" kind of stupid teenager cuz THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF A KIND!!! since its release... its always been on the top 5 best movies EVER!!!",positive
A masterpiece without question.,positive
The Greatest Mafia film ever made!!!,positive
classic. character study 101 right here. tour de force from francis ford coppola. required watching.,positive
"One of the greatest movies ever made. I wanna marry Al P. Seriously. The story is terrific and the family union also. Great chemistry between the actors, especially the Don & his sons. Pefect acting, great screenplay, very fine directing. :)",positive
You never get tired of seeing this one. Superbly told story from beginning to end.,positive
"Absolutely love this movie, its a pretty long one, but its still up there on the list of all time great mobster movies. Not a big fan of II and III though.",positive
I think the passion these guys have for their family and loyalty to their leader is what makes the movie compelling.,positive
Come on. Does this movie even need another outstanding review?,positive
Greatest movie ever made,positive
I look forward to the sequel.,positive
"If movies were food, The Godfather would be prime rib!",positive
"Absolutely brilliant, a classic and a masterpiece. If you haven't seen this then rent it now.",positive
Most amazing thing you will ever see.,positive
"The best movie ever made, period.",positive
Best movie ever...period!,positive
"It made me an offer I couldn't refuse and I took, what else is there to say?",positive
"Another movie that whenever or wherever it's playing, I drop what I'm doing and watch it. I think it endures because everyone secretly wants to be a Corleone family member.",positive
"I actually didn't remember that Diane Keaton was in this movie until I saw the starring up there. Anywho, what a great movie.",positive
"This remarkably classic film was the blueprint for mafia-based movies. Not only was the superb acting flawless in portraying the mafioso image, the movie really brings you into the life of a New York crime based family. Possibly by far the best trilogy.",positive
No hay peros. Prima di tutto c'Ã¨ la famiglia. Tu sei della famiglia?,positive
The only movie I have ever seen that captures the true mob life,positive
"If there was ever a movie to watch before you die, this is it. Adding anything else to this review would just be redundant.",positive
"Yeah, let's talk business, Mike. First of all, you're all done. The Corleone Family don't even have that kind of muscle anymore. The Godfather's sick, right? You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other Families. What do you think is going on here? You think you can come to my hotel and take over? I talked to Barzini - he says I can make a deal with him, and still keep my hotel!",positive
A Classic that will never age!!!!,positive
"depressing, 70s brown look. but completely engrossing.",positive
"For me, the best film of all time. Amazing cast. Beautifully crafted (though it took it's toll), lovely score, perfect script and a story that just pulls the viewer in and immerses them. It's one of the ""must-see-before-you-die"" films.",positive
"a little too much violence for my taste, but kind of interesting storyline",negative
literally the best movie of all time,positive
Doesn't get much better. Somewhat obligatory 5 stars.,positive
"I watched the whole collection of these, excellent films.",positive
"Simply put, the best movie ever made.",positive
All around best gangster movie. Brando what can be said? Just brillant performance.,positive
"What can i say that hasnt been said before? I can only agree that this is one of the best movies of all-time and that Brando gave one of the best performances of all time, that the story and screenplay are legendary, that Coppola his style is amazing, that Michael Corleone is one of the best characters ever to be created. The only thing i can add to this masterpiece is that the real famous quote is 'I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" not ""I'll make him"" our ""I made him"", ""I'm about to make him"", one day i even heard ""i'm going to make him a proposal"", from the 10 times i hear this quote, its 8 times wrong.",positive
Best movie ever!!! and I mean EVER!,positive
ICONIC CLASSIC MASTERPIECE BRANDO JUST A GIANT OF SCREEN,positive
If you didn't like this one...there is seriously something wrong with you :),positive

Awesome Muvee..... SOmething Rare...in the history of Cinema,positive
la mejor pelicula q eh visto en mi vida basada en uno de los mejores libros que eh leido simplemente sublime al igual q las actuaciones de marlon brandon y al pacino,positive
Even though I just saw this one last summer i fell inlove with the thick plot and the amazing film making,positive
"Excellenc defined by Coppolla himself, a godfather of film",positive
"A captivating story brought to life by an impeccable ensamble performance. Brando's Vito will forever remain one of the most spine-chilling characters of cinema. Coppola's direction sets a perfect pace, and succeeds in perhaps the most difficult aspect of the film: turning a family of murderers and liars into heroes. This film pinned me to my seat and never let go for a moment.",positive
A brilliant film. One of the great masterpieces of cinema in my opinion. I loved the scene where they're all speaking Italian. It's a beautiful film in a way.,positive
"Wow! the Godfather parts 1 and 2 among the greatest ever. Brando, Pacino, De Nero, Keaton, enough said!!",positive
"A must see and must own movie. The best movie of all time, just watch it and you'll know why.",positive
Brilliant Film! Read the book to get the characters in more detail but it has been directed so well as a film.,positive
"IncreÃ­ble, lo mejor de Al Pacino y Mrlon Brando. RepresentaciÃ³n genial de la mafia y la Ã©poca. La mejor pelÃ­cula de todas y con las mejores frases, como ""le harÃ© una oferta que no podrÃ¡ rehusar""",positive
Quite simply a brilliant film. How do you make any of those people into sympathetic characters??? FFC & the actors did. #7 on my all-time list,positive
la mejor pelicula del funcking mundo!!!!,positive
i only can say this is the god father of all movies,positive
"truely amazing, brilliant in every way the first part of the perfect trilogy",positive
The first was the best!,positive
It's The Godfather- what more is there to say,positive
"Great film in which Coppola other than making a film of the book was speaking out against the Mafia, but sadly it had the other effect in which to this day easily led people think gangsters are cool/heroes. i.e Sopranos.",positive
just a fab film and fab cast,positive
"The greatest Mafia crime drama movie of all time, it is perfect in every way",positive
"One of the greatest movies ever...period, if anyone can name a movie that has as great a cast, director, plot and delivery as this...please point it out to me!",positive
i watch at least one of the 3 every weekend. The Best Films ever,positive
Great movie. Definitely deserves to be one of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
One of my all-time favourite movies. A stunning performance all-around - a true must-see.,positive
"Not as good as the second one (and that's very rare), but the birth of the epic Mafia story genre.",positive
Brillant film of the 70's ...awesome.,positive
"A classic. The book is better than the movie and very psychological. Marlon Brando aka Vito Corleone was excellent, though. You just gotta love him.",positive
Godfather Part I Slow film but still love it,positive
quite simply the best ever film,positive
"[size=4][color=#ff0000]No one that I hang out with had even heard of ""Citizen Kane"" before that ""100 greatest American Movies"" list but EVERYONE has seen the ""Godfather.""[/color][/size]",positive
"This is just plain silliness; I am very surprised by the amount of critics who actually enjoyed this film, sensing it had a wild plot.",negative
It's THE GODFATHER. Do I seriously have to explain myself?,positive
Greatest Film of all time bar none,positive
"Someday, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But, until that day, accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.",positive
"lot of people will disagree but , i agree with peter griffin. did not like it. first of all way too long and i just lost interest. it was good however to see where cartoons like simpsons and family guy get some of there material because as i was watching this movie i was saying thats was used in this and that in this etc.",negative
"The hallmark film of cinema's second golden age; pitch-perfect casting, tour-de-force performances and second-to-none directing. Simply mindblowing.",positive
Needs no comment nor introduction!,positive
"Must watch the trilogy in one night, once a year or at leat I DO!!",positive
"i've recently watched this again, i'm still ever glued to the tv...its amazing, some may think slow paced mob movie but to me its perfect! i'm glad i bought the trilogy for someone else and kept it for myself! haha",positive
"5 estrellas, la he visto mil veces hace que quiera ser un gangster.",positive
"Synthese parfaite du blockbuster et du film d'auteur, le parrain est un classique indemodable qui assoit definitivement le statut de ""montre sacre"" de Marlon Brando et qui donne l'occasion a un inconnu de montrer l'etendue de son talent: Al Pacino",positive
"i was a child when watched it but remember how i was astonished with the combination of a good music, handsome people and an intriguing plot.",positive
A strong contender for the coveted honour of greatest movie of all time.,positive
It's the Godfather for God sake! Awesome.,positive
My all time favourite. All the series of Godfather. Classic.,positive
"bra film, men oppskrytt",positive
"It is the Godfather, what more can be said?",positive
the best ganster movie,positive

"The best movie you can watch ever. the 2nd part is great, mixed of two lifes, it show us how Vito andolini became in Vito Corleone. i love this trilogy",positive
THE GODFATHER!!! Enough said.,positive
Classic. A must see.,positive
The godfather of all gangster/mob movies. The 2nd was great and the 3rd well still great but could have been better.,positive
"a classic movie, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and a great story",positive
Masterpiece... probably one of the best movies ever made.,positive
"Crime drama + Edward = No like. That pretty much goes for all of them, and especially mob movies.",negative
Best. Movie. Of. All. Time.,positive
"A great classic. You need to see this film, one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen.",positive
long. so long. but it's a classic.,positive

This is the greatest piece of cinema of all time!!!,positive
what is there not to like?,positive
"Just Good, storyline is amazing",positive
fantastic portrayal of the mafia,positive
The greatest Movie ever made with the best selection of actors any film has ever had! Badda bing it will blow your brains out!,positive
Definitely the best movie I have ever watched. It's intricate storyline and attention to detail is second to none.,positive
Brando is so good. I love the first two but part three sucks pretty bad.,positive
"this film watches again, again, again and again...",positive
"My favorite American classic. Marlin Brando was obviously one of the greatest actors of our time. Pacino not far behind. What's not to love about the Godfather? If you haven't seen this movie, you better see it fast.",positive
the best one of the trilogy i think,positive
An offer I can never resist.,positive
Always as good as the first time I watched it....,positive
Ladies and Gent... On your knee please,positive
an offer that cant refuse...,positive
This movie just falls short of Forest Gump on my all time list. Every character is interesting the plot holds u and never lets go. The scene where Micheal has 2 shoot the two cops was one of the best scenes in movie history! This is the definition of an Oscar movie. Sunny was my favorite character.,positive
The importance of loyalty has never been explianed better than in this movie,positive
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse! Don Corleone! Love it!,positive
"greatest movie ever made about family, moral, and respect.",positive
Probably the best movie ever made.,positive
who hasn't seen it!!,positive
"You either love it, or you think its alright. Very few people don't like it.",positive
The critics aren't lying. The Gangster epic is what it is - a classic and Part II isn't far off.,positive
One of the best made films of all time. A great cast and Al Pachino was fantastic,positive
The Greatest Movie Ever Made,positive
"Brando, Pacino and a great story: a masterpiece. Maybe just one flaw: real Mafia isn't that old fashioned.",positive
Leave the gun...take the Cannoli,positive
"Absolutely amazing! I loved it! Really long, but totally worth it. Can't wait to see the other two.",positive
"Un Clasico,demasiado buena",positive
ClASSIC just Amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"Obra maestra. MÃ­ pelÃ­cula favorita. Muy parecida al libro, en la 2 retomando la historia de Vito. Pocas crÃ­ticas se pueden realizar a las 2 primeras. Brando y pacino notables",positive
the best performance of Marlon Brando,positive
it is the best movie Ä±'ve ever seen and i believe nobody wÄ±ll do same like this...,positive
"""swimming with the fishes, ""never go against the family"" and ""i made him an offer he couldn't refuse"" Enough said.",positive
greatest movie of all time,positive
"Best ganster film ever, marlon brando absolute legend",positive
"How could this movie possibly get anything other than 5 stars? C'mon!! Simply put, one of the greatest American movies ever made.",positive
My favourite film off all time. Cast is superb!!Best gangster film off all time. Class,positive
"First watched this when I was 18. Recently watched it again, another 18 years later, after having read the book. The first time, I was bored to tears. This time, after reading the wonderful novel, I enjoyed it much more but still found and it short. I accept it now as a very good movie, but still can't understand the ""Greatest Movie of All Time"" label it often receives. The second film was much better, in my opinion.",negative
The book is always better then the movie. This cause is no different. but the while the sequence was out of whack the story was told just as well,positive
"ItÂ´s a kind of ""man movie"" and thatÂ´s why I loved it. Deep, shows the emotions of ""another world"" (in many aspects for me).",positive
A movie you can watch again and again ... which is good because the networks keep showing it again and again.,positive
The original crime saga that still holds up to this day.,positive
The start of a great career (Al Pacino).,positive

Le film est un classique c'est sur, et ce grÃ¢ce Ã  sa musique, qui le rend identifiable dÃ¨s les premiÃ¨res secondes..",positive
An essential piece to American movie epics. Part of the beauty of this film is in its pace - slow and deliberate. It puts the viewer into the 1940s and keeps you there. Each transition from scene to scene is slow but that slowness offers a break from the intense dialogue and drama that takes place with the characters. Fantastic!,positive
I don't get all the buzz... It's not horrible.. but its for sure not the best movie ever...,negative
The best of the best of the best,positive
THE BEST MOVIE EVER.,positive

an exceptional movie,positive
Gets better every time,positive
"After watching Godfather Triology, everyother movie regarding the mafia styled theme or story just seems redundant.",positive
Best movie of all time. More meening than any crap out there now!!,positive
"The God of the Mob Movie, Best Classic Movie I ever had.",positive
"There's no reason why this had to be 3 hours. Everybody gives a good performance, and the film itself packs a few wollops, but it would've benefited from some tighter editing.",positive
"Far from ""the greatest movie ever made,"" although I will say it had one of the better casts. There were definitely some great moments.. but i dont know. Too many motivations left unexplained and too many moments where characters suddenly knew everything. The beginning set up a great conflict with young Michael wanting to distance himself from his family which just got forgotten along the way.",negative
"a classic movie, I tried so hard not to watch... but after a passenger wearing a movie t-shirt told me twice to watch, I surrended, watched and liked! I keep my tought, it's a guy movie, about family, but guy movie, haha. Really long however interesting, good actors. Have to watch it one more time, at least!",positive
I dare you to not wanna be in the mafia by the end of this film!,positive

No commentary required.,positive
"For some reason I just can never really get into this movie. I think it's because the first time I saw it I started halfway through, then watched the first half later.",negative
What can you say... it's the Godfather.,positive
All fans of American Cinema must see this film...simply put...Brando...,positive
beautiful. everything a movie should be.,positive
Unwritten law. Every boy must watch this at least 2 times before he becomes a man. And...you have to list this as one of your favorite movies.,positive
Perfect! That's all I can say!,positive
luca brasi sleeps with the fishes,positive
the trilogy is cinematic genius. mario puzo is the guy.,positive
Best Movie Ever Made,positive

Everyone one needs a lil godfather in their life!,positive
"Having watched this for a second time now and taken my time to understand the film I recognise that I judged this film too harshly the first time simply because for a 3 hour film there are some slower conversational scenes and Marlon Brando's raspy voice does get a little irritating after a while but these are really minor irks for a film that is quite rightly labelled a masterpiece by fans and critics alike. There are some outstanding scenes and it is brilliantly shot by Coppola before he even gave us Apocalypse Now, teaming up with Brando again seven years later. The score is terrific and so is the entire cast, particularly a very young Al Pacino but most of all Marlon Brando. Here is a man who can project fear whilst remaining perfectly calm with the same tone of voice throughout. He is essentially a crime boss who from the very beginning of the film is set up as a deeply rooted family man. It is therefore touching and actually emotional to see Don Corleone die when he is playing out in the garden alongside his son Michael's (Pacino) young kid. There are admittedly some moments where you can easily tune out but you can say that about the majority of motion pictures you see. Whilst this is far from being my favourite film of all time, I do now appreciate why there is big interest in this inspiring film. For me though, whilst we're still on the IMDB best films debate, Shawshank Redemption still beats this for me. It's more the sort of film I enjoy, what can I say?",positive
Brando and Pacino are mesmerising.,positive
Also have The Godfather part II and The Godfather III,positive
I can't stay awake through this. I've tried so many times.,negative
The best movie ever made.,positive
awesome film although not as good as part 2,positive
A classic Mafia movie.,positive
i never seem to get past the wedding part...,negative
"The quintessential 'family' film, the benchmark and Coppola's finest story.",positive
A movie I can't resist,positive
Just Brilliant...what can you say about a film with this much talent.,positive
This is IT. This is in my view the greatest film ever made. It's perfect in every way and is a truly towering epic.,positive
Greater movie! One of the best! Possibly the best movie ending of all time!,positive
Filmed in Technicolor- absolutely glorious!,positive
this is the best movie of ALL TIME!!!,positive
"Me encantÃ³ el libro, me encantÃ³ la pelÃ­cula, hermosa interpretaciÃ³n de don vito... con esta pelÃ­cula me enamorÃ© de robert de niro",positive
u want 2c an amazing gangster film then this is the 1 to watch.,positive
The best film of all time. The original and the greatest,positive
"This really is as good as its reputation would have it be -- tightly plotted, perfectly paced, brilliantly acted. I just wish that DVD rental places made sure their DVDs weren't scratchy or dirty -- I'd rather not have missed the few lines I did.",positive
ademas de ser entretenida te deja una mensaje sobre la confianza y la familia . una pelicula muy cristiana,positive
"Stanley Kubrick called this the greatest film ever made. Who the fuck are we to argue with Stanley Kubrick? Nobody, that's who.",positive

Without a doubt one of the best films ever made.,positive
better than fireworks on Christmas morning,positive
Every man needs to watch the triology before they die.,positive
Classic movie. Either you see it or your brains go across your TV!,positive

I blame everything on Connie's husband.,positive
What a film is all I can say about this film. Just epic,positive
seen them all... awesome movie,positive
"As much as I wanted to really like this film, I didn't really like it that much. The film was very long and I just couldn't stick to the story. I dozed of a bit in between some parts but I did think it was a good movie in some scenes. Al Pacino just didn't play the role right when I watched it. He showed no compassion in the sad scenes and kept a straight face. Marlon Brando was terrific in his role but someone told me that he forgot all of his lines and was reading of Q cards for the entire movie. Robert Duvall wasn't really a primary character in this film and he was only in speaking scenes and no action was involved with his character. A very violent and powerful movie, good directing but the story was too long. I'll have to watch this movie again when I'm fully awake and when I understand the Mafia a bit better.",negative
"I'm slightly embarrassed that I didn't see this movie until now. It's pretty great. Finally a ""classic"" three-hour movie that doesn't FEEL like three hours or more (I'm looking at you, Gone with the Wind and Dr. Zhivago...) I must say that the DVD transfer of this that I watched (probably done more than 10 years ago)...sucks. It's grainy and flat-looking and crappy. It doesn't look good at all, and it needs to be re-mastered. Maybe when they release it on Blu-Ray or HD-DVD. Anyway, Brando and Pacino turn in great performances here...obviously. What can I say about The Godfather. Is this movie in the top three ever made, as some seem to think? I dunno... Maybe. For one of those unbelievably ""hyped"" movies, it lived up to my expecations pretty well, which is all I can ask.",positive
Classic. Father of all mob movies,positive
If you have to ask then your not a movie fan,positive
"This is one of the undying classics that everyone needs to see. Beyond the violence, there is a wonderful and interesting storyline that shows mafia activity of this era.",positive
"The only movie worthy of the word ""PERFECT""",positive
"Romance, blood, and blood relatives...with some cannoli thrown in...",positive
truly awe inspiring in places.,positive
"Its effect is somewhat deadened by frequent parody, and it suffers from being overrated, but, yeah, it's really good.",positive
"Wow. I ﬁnally saw this from beginning to end (I had seen bits prior) and was mesmerized. The character development is brilliant, and Coppola gets down to good old-fashioned storytelling, something Hollywood does not do very well these days. The Rota themes are haunting and the score, in general, remains powerful. Brando is so-so; it’s Pacino who makes this.",positive
A Masterpiece!!!! I wonder how would cost have all these actors together now?,positive
"Ahh, super cool, ashamed I havent seen it before now. Pacino and Caan are BA.",positive
The greatest film ever made. Ever.,positive
Do you really need a comment? Hasn't everyone seen this?,positive
One of the best movies of all time. 'Nuff said.,positive
LOVED this movie! It had really awesome unexpected character development.,positive
Classic. The ending makes up for the parts that seem dead in the middle of the film.,positive
Only topped by its sequal,positive
Unsurpassable! This is it.,positive
The classic picture of Vito Corleone will forever be remembered by late Marlon Brando. Great masterpiece..,positive
"I really love the book and the film is much better,",positive
come on its the god father,positive
"some people don't know why they like it, they just do. i'm not one of them. i don't have the time, nor the desire to tell you why, just take my word.",positive
the best movie ever made hands down,positive
Who hasn't seen it? Pure Classic,positive
"This is the benchmark of mafia films. Amazing script, and acting that hasn't been better before or after. Brando is great, but he should have had the Oscar for best SUPPORTING, because as I see it he is not the lead role, Pacino is. But anyway, this is definitely a film you have to watch before you die!",positive
Love the book. Love the film. Can watch over and over again. Prefer to watch 1 and 2 one after the other. Part 2 best sequel ever made,positive
This movie is flawless in its portrayal of the Mafia gang and their influence on the society at the time. The acting is amazing and the plot is perfect. Marlon Brando especially shines here with his performance and atmosphere when he comes on scene. This is definitely the film that has stepped up the film industry as not just entertainment but as something that makes you think.,positive
Marlon Brando er filmens helt store oplevelse! Intet mindre end genial. I Ã¸vrigt bare Ã (C)n af mange super prÃ¦stationer. Og musikken er jo legendarisk...,positive
"The dialogue and story line have so many hidden meanings that you have to watch it a couple of times to fully understand it, but that's what makes a good movie.",positive
You can't say anything about this film that hasn't been said better. I watch it once a year.,positive
i am gonna make u an offer you will never refuse! :),positive

You cant mess with this movie,positive
"Godfatherfilmene er bare kult...de er gennemfoerte, velspillede og underholdende og saa kan man jo ikke bede om mere",positive
"Although most people like the second film better, I would say that this is the best. Plus, James Caan is fantastic in it.",positive
Brilliant film. Some of the best acting you will ever find in one film. The story line is perfect and to say over 70% of Marlon Brando's lines were improvised he did a damb good job.,positive
But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever.,positive

classic; the only mob movie worth watching (besides Godfather II),positive
"I keep going back and forth... is it superior to Part Two or does Part Two surpass Part One? They are both remarkable and enjoyable, so it really is a question for film experts. The more I watch it, the less of a gangster/Mafia film it seems and the more of a family movie it becomes. Although Vito takes part in organized crime, he does so with honor and respect... and expect the same of those around him. He is a stern yet loving father... he adores his family. We never see any evidence of a mistress. His wife is no shrinking violet. He greatly trusts his adopted son... more so than his middle boy Fredo. You can act like a man! A man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man. I live my life, I don't apologize to take care of my family. Never tell anyone outside the family what you're thinking again! Vito is the American Dream... and we get even more evidence of this in Part Two.",positive
All time favorite movie ever!,positive
"De lo mejor.... la actuacion de Al Pacino simplemente espectacular, sin olvidar a Marlon Brando",positive
"My absolute all-time favorite movie...Acting, directing, cinematography...Excellence all around...",positive
"""You come and ask me for a favour, but when was the last time you just came around for a cup of coffee, to talk."" I like this movie because it can be related to so easily. Better than the next two Godfathers by miles.",negative
Just one of the best old movies. A must see,positive
Who DOESNT love the godfather tbf..!?,positive

"The Godfather actually gives you some insight of the life of the mob in the early 30's, I like it, good actors, and good story",positive
the best movie ever!!!!!!!,positive
"This American classic set the bar for a new generation of the gangster genre. Long gone are the mindless bad guys of the film noir era, these criminals are smart, organized, and likeable. Coppola takes the viewer for the first time into the family and lets us all experience the good and the bad of organized crime.",negative
"Como siempre Pacino, con una buena pelÃ­cula y una buena actuaciÃ³n. AdemÃ¡s le luce el look de los 70's",positive
"Espectacular. Un clasico de clasicos..la mejor pelicula del mundo!! Las actuaciones, la escenografia, la musica, todo es simplemente perfecto y adecuado para la historia.",positive
"Classic movie. Perfect in every way. I love that scene between Pacino and Brandon in the garden ""there just wasn't enough time Michael"" god i love that line.",positive
A Story that needed to be told. Brando deserved his Oscar for the performance he gave.,positive
Marlon Brando: amazing. Al Pacino: fierceness in his eyes. A wonderful movie that has shown Italian Mafia all over the world!,positive
"i'm going to be honest. Lots of people would give five starts because its a given that this is a classic, and it is a classic, but i wasnt wowd.i think i need to watch it again. Good film, but not as entertaining as say goodfellas. but yea, built up to much i suppose. and it couldnt have been any better, so that means there was nothing wrong with it...hmmm, i'll watch it again..",positive
the best film in the world!!,positive
"The best movie of all time. Incredible, sweeping story. Some of the most classic, timeless performances in the history of cinema. Brilliant often copied cinemetography. Dialogue so famous it has entered our everyday lexicon. One of the once in a lifetime instances where luck, skill, timing and talent all coincided in a cosmic accident that created this - the best movie ever put on film.",positive
"Classic. Great performances. Wonderful visuals. Not the world masterpiece lots of people make it out to be, and Coppola is not a first-rank director, but this is soooo much better than the book it's incredible. Pacino's performance is a tour de force, though they don't give him much time onscreen for his big change. Not sure why they did that to him. The movie would probably be a world masterpiece if they'd thought about that a bit more...one cool tracking shot and all of a sudden he's a capo de tutti capi? Huh.",positive
The other side of the coin of Goodfellas - two views of the mob in American culture. Epic masterpiece. Confronts us with what is admirable and despicable about the mob - and proof that loyalty to people over ideas is invariably a formula for moral disaster.,positive

this is how movies should be like : ),positive
"it is hailed as a film of classic. I love the acting of Al Pacino, who is Michael Corleone in The Godfather. i watched this a few days ago, however it is still lingering over my mind now! I cant describe my feelings for this film clearly All i can say is that i am impressed and shocked by The Godfather=P",positive

Trilogie culte Ã  voir et revoir sans modÃ©ration. Un monument du cinÃ©ma. La scÃ¨ne oÃ¹ Michael Corleone perd sa fille sur les marches de l'opÃ©ra est la plus forte Ã©motion cinÃ©matographique que j'ai ressenti.Quel jeu !!!!!,positive
What can i say...amazing.Marlon Brando and Al Pacino immortalised themselves after this movie.,positive
"A very long movie, but worth it if you can stay awake to the end.",positive
Marlon Brando's acting. Thousands of actors have spent their lives just trying Brando's 'Godfather' moves. Thousands of film-makers have spent their lives to make a film in way Coppola did. Godfather is the best movie I have ever watched in my life.,negative
A wonderful allegory for the American dream.,positive
"The Godfarth is considered a monumental achievement in film. But to be honest with you, I just dont hold it in the same light as most of my friends. Granted, I found Pachino's performance as Michael, and his evolution into the Godfather to be stunning. But the movie as a whole had a lot of down scenes that made me ask the question ""what is the point of this scene? A good movie, hell a great movie, but i wouldn't consider it the 800 gorilla that everyone else makes it out to be",negative
One of the true modern-day cinema epics. Superb acting. Unforgettable,positive
"you know, godfather 2 was better, but damn if this movie isn't spectacular as well. the only reason this movie doesnt have the full 5 is cuz somehow the sequel surpassed it. pacino does so well going from quiet to intense back to quiet again.",positive
One of the best movies ever made! Hands down..a must have item in everyone's dvd collection!,positive
great Marlon Brando!!,positive
My favorite movie of all time,positive

"Sonny: Hey, whaddya gonna do, nice college boy, eh? Didn't want to get mixed up in the Family business, huh? Now you wanna gun down a police captain. Why? Because he slapped ya in the face a little bit? Hah? What do you think this is the Army, where you shoot 'em a mile away? You've gotta get up close like this and - bada-BING! - you blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit. C'mere...",positive
"This is a classic for good reason, it adapts the story perfectly, with great characters and acting.",positive
"Awesome. Outstanding acting, story, and music. Same goes for Part II. I'm most impressed with John Cazale as Fredo. John was only in a handful of movies before his death from cancer in 1978, bui they were all great. If not for his premature death, he'd be on just about everyone's short list of the greatest actors, up there with Pacino and De Niro.",positive
Nothing can compare to the Godfather,positive
Great great movie! I loved the three of them,positive
best cartoon ive watched,negative
The granddaddy of all crime movies. with a amazing story and classic cast it still holds up well even today.,positive
"This is so good because every time I watch it I never want the opening sequence to end--there is just so much FAMILY, and HAPPINESS, and BUSINESS, and the place they're in, the Corleone household--oh I wish I could be a part of that, I wish that could last forever...and then the rest of the movie commences and it chills me every time.",positive
The greatest gangster movie ever made.,positive
"What can I say? It's the frickin' Godfather. One of the great stories of a single man's fall from grace, from citizen to criminal kingpin. You genuinely like him before he becomes a murdering bastard.",positive

Only watch it once every year or so otherwise you'll forget why it's so good,positive
"An all time classic Mafia movie. Al Pacino is amazing, as is the rest of the cast.",positive
I always crave Italian food after watching,positive
i know i suck but i'd rather watch goodfellas about twenty more times,negative
"definately the best godfather movie, although i enjoyed them all",positive
Does it get any better than this? Engrossing and facinating.,positive
"It has the power to keep you watching for almost three hours: an ability most movies do not possess. But the question is this: does it really deserve the title 'Best movie of all time'? I disagree there. Although interesting and well - displayed, it lacks the power to rank in my Top 10, or even my favourite movies. I cannot stand Al Pacino; let's get that out of the way. He's hyperactive, shouts too much and thinks too little. In every single movie, or most of them, at least. Marlon Brando's cotton - wool - in - cheeks voice may take some getting used to, but he gives the character form like no other could. Coppola is a skilled director and has a good enough view of what will catch the eye. I'm a biggie for script and the realism of the spoken word. That 'nickels and dimes' line is perhaps the most unbelievable ever. The chucking in of Italian terms doesn't fit with the strong American accents some of the family members have adopted. The characters seem to be rather blatantly sexist (in the traditional light), but that's no fault of Coppola's or any of the actors. I understand that Gangsterism is very much a male - dominated world, but there's no need for Michael to be a dickhead to all the women he meets, or for the family to scorn the birth of a female child over that of a male. Kay sticks with Michael ultimately, though he is abusive and rude, despite her actually having a brain and being financially independent. Essentially, <i>The Godfather</i> portrays the 20th century, and is often subtly unfriendly to the female viewer. Not that this should put off any female fans (of which there are many), it just became rather apparent to me personally. Perhaps the movie's prestigious reputation is ultimately it's small downfall in my books. But just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean it's a bad film.",negative
Another classic. Gotta love it. How could you not love this movie?,positive
"A classic, and a good representation of the book too!",positive
a unique movie i haver ever seen.,positive
Everyone keeps saying that The Godfather pt II is the best of The Godfather series. But I never found it to be true. The Godfather pt I no doubt has always been the best of the series and is also one of the greatest movie of all time.,positive
"Kaikki parhaat samassa paketissa.. Coppola, Brando, Pacino.. Loistava ohjaus, paljon tilaa nÃ¤yttelijÃ¶ille ja mielenkiintoinen aihe. SivistyksessÃ¤ on paha iso aukko, jos ei ole nÃ¤hnyt KummisetiÃ¤.",positive
Cel mai bun film din toate timpurile!,positive
This tops for its genre. I love the emotional and moving stuff but also love the gansgter movies too. How many times have I watched it? Lost count.,positive
3 films to7fa al pacino the master unlimited stars,positive
The best films ever!,positive
Incredibly engaging story. Some very disturbing imagery that used to haunt me as a child. Wonderfully crafted classic piece of film.,positive
A classic. Need I say more?,positive
one of the best mafia movie ever,positive
Classic. Probably the best done movie of all time. Nothing more to say about this film but utter genius.,positive
Great performance of Brando but even more of Al Pacino who evolves from innocence to godfatherhoold (in all senses). Every single character is very dense and this what also makes this movie remarkable.,positive
It does not get any better then this. What a great movie. Al Pacino is the man.,positive
"Riktigt bra. Man fÃ¥r en hÃ¤ftig inblick i hur en Cosa Nostra-familj (kanske) fungerar. Mycket realistiskt skildrade vÃ¥ldsscener men samtidigt fokus pÃ¥ hur ""familjen"" fungerar.",positive
"I have watched this movie and Godfather II at least 25 times. You need to watch it a few times in order to follow the chronology of the story, which flashes back and forward in time across generations, as if through memories. It's the story of an immigrant family that built its success on crime. What makes the characters so compelling is their familial love for each other and the individual sacrifices that they make for the sake of the family and the American Dream. As depicted through the world of the American Mafia and the succession of Don Corleone's commercial empire through his very different sons Sonny, Michael, and Frankie. Among the great themes intertwined in this trilogy of movies, How many generations does it take to launder ill-gotten gains clean? Intense, dark cinematography, legendary scenes and acting, eerie soundtrack. Must see!",positive
The best there is bar none,positive
Do I need to explain why this is one of the best films ever made?,positive
"definitely the best episode of the trilogy.. The baptism scene was the most intense scene in cinema history and It pushed the limit of how good a picture could be, just fascinating!",positive
Mob classic. Love it!,positive
"FFC's masterpiece in a trilogy .... amazing filmwork, cinematography, dialogues, ambience, etc etc and top-notch acting .... forgot i was watching a movie the first time i saw The Godfather",positive
One of the greatest Mafia films ever!!!,positive
The near three hours didn't even feel like one. Absorbing and ingenious. Marlon Brando delivers a jaw dropping performance. Perfection.,positive
The Greatest Movie Ever Made. Peroid!!!,positive
"I was lucky enough to read the book first, which was outstanding. I then indulged in the movie only to be gob smacked by how over hyped this move is. Seems like people just have to say this movie is good....well it isn't.",negative
Maybe the best movie ever made..,positive
"I'm not sure why it's so good. The characters are unique, there's a small amount of humor sprinkled into the tension, and the mood is so thick. The momentum isn't sustainable though. I tend to turn it off after the middle part or just skip ahead to the Baptism.",positive
Best Picture! Best Cinematography! Best Editing! Best Screenplay! Best Production Design!,positive
"What can I say, it's the Godfather, and it is his character, portrayed so well by Brando that makes this a great film. Brando is so natural and gives such life to Vito Corleone just as the actors around him do with their characters, Pacino especially too. This is just a sharp film. Not too violent, not too profane, yet deeply involving in vice and illegal activities.",positive
"I watched it half way... i read the book. It seemed alright, nothing fantastic. al pacino and diane keaton both look young",negative
Epic which needs to description,positive
"great film, will always be a classic",positive
must be seen it dose go on abit but fab neverless,positive

The best movie ever.,positive
See it when I was only 4 years old with my late father. Still remember the impact it hit on me. Stunning movie.,positive
Absolutely brilliant. I'm definitely fascinated by the world of organized crime.,positive
"36 years after its release this is still THE movie. The benchmark to which all others are compared. Memorable scenes, endlessy quotable dialogue, great characters, the atmosphere throughout the film is just so electryfying. Hugely influential in many ways........and just WHAT a performance from Al Pacino. Al who.. ? You forget your watching an actor, he IS michael corleone. 5 stars doesn't even come close.",positive
..'m gonna make him an offer he can't refuse...,positive
Best of the trilogy.,positive
My number one...always!,positive
Word. Coppola is the man.,positive
I need not comment...,positive
Really nice movie !!,positive
"Great story. Really fake deaths, unfortunately, but hey, it's the 70s! Anyway, I really liked it. Didn't love it, but I can see why it's a classic.",positive
Francis Coppola made art out of a potboiler. Top THAT.,positive
"I think I would really appreciate this movie if I saw it again. For now, it just seems overrated.",positive
"one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen, period!",positive
hands down the best movie and the cast is outstanding.,positive
"What else can I say, one of the best films of all time.",positive
Another one of my gangster faves. I can't count how many times I've seen this film.,positive
My favourite movie ever. Behind the Godfather II.,positive
The greatest gangster movie ever made.,positive
"El unico ""inconveniente"" de esta fantastica pelicula es, que debes sentarte a verla, ya que todas las escenas son importantes y la manera en la que se desarrollan tiene repercusiones mas adelante a medida que transcurren las 3hrs que dura un film para degustarlo cada vez que sea observado",positive
"This is a total masterpiece, and only communists, anti-semites, and terrorists will tell you otherwise. don't trust anyone that is against the Godfather (except III -- that one blew ass).",positive
How far can each of us sink? This movie is everything that fans say it is. Who are you? Where do you come from? Are you REALLY that much different than Michael?,positive
Easily the greatest film of all time.,positive
The mother of all US Mafia movies... only few French style mafia movies also raise my pulse equally high!,positive
The epic masterpiece of Francis Ford Coppola does not need presentations...,positive
"Simply put, this the greatest movie ever made. I can safely say without hyperbole that it is 1 million times better than Citizen Kane... it was his sled.",positive
Best Mafia Movie EVER!!!,positive
The best damn movie ever made.,positive
This one is the best of all the trilogy!!! it's a must in every computer :),positive
"Love all of the Godfather moves. Truly great, great plot, great acting and that added spice of nastiness and lowness and meanness. But could any of us be forced this low? Some of the great movies of all time. The best of Marlon Brando - love his acting in this.",positive
"obviously the best of the three, what a film",positive
"The best of the 3 Godfather movies by far. Marlon Brando IS the Godfather, end of story!",positive
This is by far the best film ever made. Anyone who hasn't seen it - really should!,positive
A fascinating all time classic. Don'tmiss that one,positive

"it's difficult to watch a film about which you've heard SO MUCH!! As for it being the best film ever made, which I've heard a lot, I could only then be disappointed. My advice: keep your expectations in check and enjoy in an earnest way.",negative

Besoin d'un commentaire?,positive
"ok... soo this is arguably the greatest film ever. Voted by popular demand on varies websites. I do agree that this film is in fact a great film. I thought there was nothing that the film could have done better to improve for its time period. Although not my taste in film, i do appreciate the great level of talent in both acting and production wise.",positive
Great movie! I'm a huge ganster flick fan and a huge Al Pacino fan. This is one of the best movies ever made.,positive
I'll just say that if you haven't seen this then rent all 3 of these movies and call in to work and watch them.You won't be sorry.,positive

one of the best movies ever made,positive
sweet movie and the game is also pretty sweet pretty long but still cool,positive
"""Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever."" Classic. Just love this movie. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone brilliantly, i love the way the movie shows how the many sacrificies Michael takes for the family business changes him into a totally different person from what he was at the begining of the film.",positive
Quite possibly the best movie ever made. No joke.,positive

Hate the whole series!,negative
"Simple . ""Jue' la madre"" q movie.",positive
An absolute masterpiece!!,positive
"That which all Mafia movies, if not aspire to, at least pay homage to. Marlon Brandon's performance is eerie, laconic, and amazing. But, nonetheless, the second half of the film unravels into banality and the trilogy, too, follows suit.",positive
"excellent movie, i epic! i was enthralled by the cast and the plot. great performances by marlon brando and al pacino. one of my all time favorites...",positive
One of my alltime favourites,positive

Greatest movie ever made,positive

THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!,positive
Cannot get any better.Francis Ford directing Marlon Brando..phew!,positive
absolutley an offer you can`t refuse.....,positive
"A MUST SEE!!! The Godfather stands as a fascinating classic that can never be out dated. Don't miss the chance to see Brando and Pacino's remarkable performances. As scary as it is intelligent, as funny as it is touching, The Godfather is a prime example of the way a movie should be. It is the film to top all films, one of the finest motion pictures not only of our time but of any time. The Godfather has already stood the test of a quarter century, it will stand the test of time as time continues to plod on. As long as they teach cinema, they will teach The Godfather.",positive

The film for better and for worse established the Italian family. It faithfully showed the customs and whatnot. Integrating that to the Italian mob. Starring a great cast some known and some relatively new at the time. Pacino established himself as a great actor for the generation and Brando again gave a critical worthy performance. It's dark and *at the time* graphic mob violence.,positive
long as fuck but awsome!,positive
I don't think you're allowed to not like this movie,positive
Great storyline & movie.,positive
Godfather 1-3 great movies!,positive
one of the greatest of all time!!!!,positive
Easily the best movie of all time. Al Pacino honestly deserved that Best Supporting Actor Oscar. The Academy foolishly didn't give the Best Director Oscar. I pity the fool who don't like this movie. Five Words: Miss At Your Own Peril.,positive
Wish i could give it 10 stars,positive
It really is an offer you can't refuse.,positive
My favorite movie of all time. A true classic.,positive
This is the way that movies are supposed to be made. This is the ultimate Mobster movie and the ultimate movie of all time,positive
"una leyenda, esa pelicula es la inspiradora de todas las pelis de gangsters",positive
"Impressive story, inmortal acting by al pacino and marlon brando and one of the best directors hollywood has had.",positive
"Considered by man one of the greatest films of all time, I actually find it a close second to its sequel. Brando's performance coupled with the superb supporting cast make this less of a gangster film and more of a study familial love. Francis Ford Coppola was at the top of his game, but I point to the script, the cast and the production team a sbeing the real reasons this film became the legend it is.",positive
In my top 5 favorites,positive
"I put it on my favorite movie list just out of sheer peer pressure/mob mentality... but now that I think of it, I liked it. I really, really liked it. (can't say the same thing of part II)",positive
"da riguardare , peccato che questa epoca e finita!!!",positive

simplemente...excelente,positive
"a really good movie, i love Al Pacino!",positive
My favourite of all movies,positive
"Upon re-watching it, it's interesting to note how Brando is not the center of the film. This was Pacino's film just like its (slightly better) sequel.",positive
"one of the best crime movies on the planet. Nobody can ever match Marlon, Al Pacino was the next best thing",positive
The father of all gangster movies... Its the best and greatest tale of the Mafia uprising in the USA :),positive

One of the best gangster films as well as one of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
Respected and feared by ALL!!!!!,positive

no comment its just incredible,positive

"Holy Hell, my first Al Pacino movie..I shall forever love it",positive
One of the best movies ever,positive
A movie you can't refuse!,positive
"Everyone I knew told me this was the best film of all time, well if the best movie of all time is a bunch of Italians sitting around talking and doing nothing, than YA THIS ROCKED! But, it didn't, in fact, I found it quite boring. But, it did have some really strong points and interesting characters, but in the end, it was ok.",negative
I just couldn't get into it like everyone else. But I don't get the big deal about mob movies in general.,negative
La mejor pelicula de gangsters hecha hasta el momento... y tiene mas de 30 aÃ±os,positive
talking about doing it mafia style?? no this the bomb!!,positive
"Obra capital del cine!!! Marlon Brando es el cine, y El Padrino es no solo una pelicula, sino parte de la cultura general.",positive
"Someday, and tat day may never come, I'll call up on you and ask you a favor for me, 'till that day... accept this... as a gift",positive
I do like this movie LOVE RENEE,positive
U know...I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse...lol,positive
I'm just tryin to download that triology from torente. I hope that I will have a luck,positive
what can i say? great movie. every character (sans sonny) was understated and facinating.,positive
Great film... watch it so that you can watch the even more impressive sequel.... but pretend the 3rd one was never made.,negative
"Italian gangster movies are really all the same, but they're still cool.",positive
"I think Marlon Brando is very convincing as a hardened criminal. I don't like violence, but I have to say this movie is so shocking it must be one of the best I ever watched.",positive
dont fuck with him hell but a feckin horses head in your bed,positive
The greatest movie of all time,positive
la mejor de todos los tiempos. Each man has his own destiny.,positive
"classic movie from Coppola ,, i used to watch it when i was little kid :)",positive
FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA 10/10,positive
arguably the greatest movie ever its flawless,positive
Greatest movie ever done with extraordinary actors (Marlon brando and Al Pacino)!,positive
"A great story, turned into a f*cktastic screenplay, add some great acting, a great director and you've got yourself the best movies ever made. I'm not discussing morals, I'm not talking about innovation, I'm just talking about the art and the craft of making movies at it's finest.",positive

el clasico por excelencia del genero mafioso,positive
its just a masterpiece innit. best film ever.,positive
Best mafia movie ever...right there with Braveheart for tops,positive
excellent the whole trillogy!,positive
Definitely deserves the standing to be a classic. The only thing that takes down the rating for me is the pace. I felt like the movie could have been paced better. The character development was perfect and so was (most) the acting. I'm glad I finally got to watch it.,positive
love the fucking movie,positive

"Do I need to say it, its the Godfather, father of all freakn gangster movies! great cast, great story, but ofcourse its long as hell but its worth it",positive
Like I need to rate it?,positive
Absolute masterpiece of ganster film proportions.,positive
"All aspects from cinematography to cast are very fitting. I don't expecially llike mobster movies, yet the violence here was so timely and tactful that you cannot help but savour it. And Al Pacino is crazy hot.",positive
"One of my top 5 films of all time. Superb, spellbinding acting, direction, cinematography, and music all combined into a beautiful saga of one of the last great ""crime"" families in post-WWII America. I fell in love with Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, and Marlon Brando with this movie. The 2nd one is definitely wonderful as well, but this one does it for me because of the wonderfully written scenes between Vito (Brando) and his youngest son Michael (Pacino). If you are pursuing acting or anything involved in the film world, please see this movie. It's amazing.",positive

"C'est le parrain, baise moi la main...",positive
"I watched all three hours of this movie and noticed nothing special; nothing that stood out as vital or fresh or exciting - it's actually very by-the-numbers, and not at all visceral. It's stodgy and dun, even boring. I would say it compares well to other dramatic films which garnered attention from the academy at the time; it's well-made, certainly, but not transcendentally so. This movie has been topped probably a dozen or so times within its own genre since it came out (I still think the best of these is Sergio Leonoe's final opus - 'Once Upon a Time in America' - which is underseen and underrated because it was butchered by studio execs upon US release). I am, in fact, quite suspicious of this movie. There is a degree of romanticization of organized crime which, I think, does nobody any good. A large part of the enduring appeal of movies like this one is not so much its purely cinematic virtue, but its valorization of mafia culture, imbuing it with a cool and irresistable machismo. It may not be fair to say that this is the tone of the film - it is more sophisticated than that, but I think that is how it has come to be viewed by a vast majority of its admirers, and explains why they are so eager to identify with it. This strikes me as very naive and even dangerous. It's a phenomenon that bothers me ('Scarface' is another prominent example). Therefore, I've got to say that I do not much care for 'The Godfather'.",negative
"meme les deuxieme ou troisieme role sont jouer par des acteur stars, ou en devenir que dire de plus...",positive
"A classic movie, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando need I say more!",positive
"After hearing several of my friends say that the character of Michael was unrealistic, I was expecting another acclaimed movie that was not very satisfying at all. That, however, was not the case. This movie is great, showing exactly how far people will go to defend the foundations of their lives. It's into the top 10.",positive
"No doubt a well made movie but, if I'm honest, I was pretty bored watching it. I admit I'm not a fan of gangster/mafia movies but I was hoping it would hold my interest more than it did. I'll not be watching it again, that's for sure.",negative
One of(if not THE) best movies ever made.,positive
you wanna sleep wit da fishes?,positive
The greatest American film ever...,positive
The greatest movie of the 20'th century.,positive
Highly highly recommended. Francis Ford Coppola got this right and the cast was outstanding.,positive

full of fluffy bunnies. Not.,positive
Best movie ever made.,positive
FINALLY got around to seeing this a few years ago. Terrific cast and the story just sucks you in like a motherfucker.,positive
"This movie came out when I was 2. I remember I watch it back in the late 70's. Then all through the years, it is being replayed on TV or cable so many times, which I never did see it from start to finish. Now, I sat down, and finished it...man, this is a genuine classic.",positive
"One of the Best movies ever made. If u havent seen this shit, go fuckin rent it right now. I was one of the assholes who thought 70s movies sux. but after i watched GODFARTHER, it got me hooked up on all 70s classics and italian mafia movies. The BEST ever, period",positive
"""The Godfather"" is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema... His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal ""families,"" and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times... With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has reached legendary statues... Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime... While crime may be the first image that comes into one's mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by ""liquor, gambling, and even women..."" He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""sovereignty."" In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly... The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability... Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment ""Never to take sides against the Family."" The opening shot of ""The Godfather"" sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter... Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters: Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfatherâ steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie ""big shot"" named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer... With a beautiful score by Nino Rota immensely memorable, Coppola's motion picture remains a triumph, nearly perfect in its execution, composition, and impact...",positive

This is quite simply the best you can get. Great characters blessed by some great actors.,positive
The original mafia movie,positive
"While it's not #1 on my IMDB list, I still think it's one of the best crime dramas ever made and certainly a very important film in the growth and development of mainstream cinema. It's a surprisingly brutal movie for the early 70s and one that leaves you scarred not due to the setups but the way that the actors play their scenes with such jarring conviction. James Caan in particular commands segments of the picture as Sonny, and his relationship with Talia Shire may be the most heartbreaking part of the whole movie. Brando is, of course, completely on top of his game as the dying patriarch of the family. You see it in his face, even when he's silent. Coppola meanwhile, has photographed and structured the film with patience and a feel for suspense and dramatic explosions. The last shot, while somewhat idolized now, is still unforgettable, and note perfect.",positive
I could watch it a million times!!!,positive
"Le plus grand film de tous les temps, nÂ°1 au top250 IMDB",positive

Watched it first time only a few years bk as boyfriend is diehard fan...I get why...it really is a mafia masterpiece! It's all very fascinating and intruiging stuff!,positive
"It's the freakin' Godfather. What more needs to be said? This is a masterpiece of a movie with an all star cast and some of the best acting that could be asked for in a film. If you haven't seen this film and you call yourself a movie fan, you should be ashamed of yourself for not having seen this work of art.",positive
My favorite gangster movie.,positive
If you have to see one gangster flick in your life may it be this one. The original and grandaddy of them all.,positive
Al Pacino... The Best.,positive
great film though i prefer part 2,positive
Real man's movie as I read Mario Puzo's novel in college and I know I became to love it.,positive
"Iconic, classic tale of mob-life. Wonderful drama.",positive
"This film is very close to perfect. And to all of you who say this movie is boring, I say, ""Shut up, You stupid, ADD, action junkies!"" Brando gives a flawless performance that will forever be remembered as such.",positive
"Please, we must tell the directors to stop following my family around, The wedding scene at the beginning, I did the set design, and costuming.",positive
This along with the other two in the series are the greatest films ever made. nothing has ever been this well-casted or acted really for that matter. The direction is some of Coppola's best directing.,positive
The all time classic of mafia movies.,positive
Greatest Movie ever no question.,positive
I LOVE YOU MICHAEL CORLEONE,positive
Greatest movie ever made. Period.,positive
Greatest movie ever made. Period.,positive
I honestly did not like this film. Perhaps I should see it again...,negative
One of the best films ever made,positive
My favorite film - period.,positive
Forest is probably the most lovable character in film history...cinematography is weak...however this movie is full of character.,positive
A dark and horrifying masterpiece of a mafia family set in New York in the 1940s. Flawlessly brilliant and a legendary classic that will stick with you for a LONG TIME!,positive
Quite Possibly The Best Movie Of All Time,positive
I believe in America.,positive
"I'll make you an offer you can't refuse. Seriously, it's the benchmark for all organized crime movies.",positive
"I read Mario Puzo' s novel The Godfather when I was at 7th grade, and somehow I was really fascinated by the world of 40s New York Mafia, things that were captured in the Cosa Nostra. A few years later I saw the movie. I expected to see something that would ruin the strong memories of the novel, but on the contrary, the movie was as captivating as the novel written by Puzo if not even more captivating. The attractive darkness is not only in the things that happen but also in wonderflul screenplay - and ON SCREEN. Only thing that botherd me, when I saw the film first time, was Diane Keaton as Kay Adams: I couldn't imagine Keaton as Kay, although she played the role really well.",positive
there are no words to describe how good this movie was,positive
selon moi le meilleur des 3. J'adore l'ambiance sans parlÃ© des acteurs gÃ©niaux!! (;-) AL!!!!!),positive
"Superb movie. Not bored for even a second. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and James Caan as also Robert Duvall all were superb. immortal classic.",positive
Will always be the greatest movie ever made. Long live the Don.,positive
"We just can't stay away from this seductive, dark, heartbreaking, and simultaneously brilliantly captivating film. I cannot explain my obsession with mob flicks-although this is not just another mob flick-other than the desire for power... And Vito is truly the most powerful figure in film...",positive
I love this trilogy.... thanks Francis.,positive
a true classic. Almos as good as the second movie.,positive
what els to say? A true classic Brando is brilliant,positive
The all time Favorite Movie,positive
"Pure class, but not quite as good as Goodfellas :)",positive
"A bit dull, really. Can I say that, here?",negative
The movie you can miss in your life.,positive
"Wow The First 7 Mins. Of This Film Blew My Mind. The Sound, Cinematography and Mezzon-Syn Were All Masterfully Done. I Loved The Use Of Shadows And Colors. Props Go Out To Every One Who Worked On This Film. Marlon Brando Is The GodFather! The Action, Drama, Character Development and Symbolism was Great. This Film Rocked My World. If I Had To Make One Complaint It Would Involve The Length. Francis Ford Coppola And Marlon Brando Work Well Together. I Loved This Film But Nothing Is Better Than What Those Two Did In Apocalypse Now.",positive
No need for comment...,positive
"was not bad, damn, everybody give it full five stars!",positive
the best fil eva eva invented........amazin........my most fav film without a doubt x,positive
trop la classe !! i love all off godfathers films and al pacinoooo mamamia !!!!,positive
a genius movie that takes a genius to recognize it's ingeniousness.,positive
Var till en bÃ¶rjan skeptisk mot filmen trots mÃ¥nga rekomendationer frÃ¥n mina vÃ¤nner. Men filmen Ã¤r mycket vÃ¤l genomtÃ¤nkt och den Ã¤r inte samma action/macho gangsterfilm som alla andra filmer inom genren. Det som gÃ¶r att filmen Ã¤r nÃ¥gonting speciellt Ã¤r just det att man fÃ¥r se hur de inte kan lite pÃ¥ nÃ¥gon. Helt enkelt en mycket bra film.,positive
Most favourite movie....Ever Along with part 2 of course,positive
best movie ever made!!!! wat a legend!!,positive
Favourite ever. Just brilliant,positive
"My all time favorite classic movie, can't even remember how many times I watched this, hehe!",positive
"I love all of the Godfather films, though the book is a hell of a lot better and my favorite of all time, the movie is still damn good. Quality actors too.",positive
great all time film.,positive
"A classic, must-see film for EVERYONE, regardless of movie taste.",positive
"Not only the greatest mob movie ever made, but the behind the scenes stories are fascinating",positive
Lite överskattad är den väll?,positive
La mejor pelÃ­cula de la historia,positive
One of the best movies of all time.,positive
im the first person to not give this movie a perfect yea its a classic but the seconds better and the thrids just a perfect piece of shit,positive
way too convulted storyline needs to be rewritten,negative
"Greatest movie of all time, Pacino and Brando, cant be beat.",positive
You pick up something new every time you watch it.,positive
The one that started it all!,positive
"Great story,acting, writing, etc",positive
"I can't believe it took me 29 years to watch this movie. It's really good. Even though it's like three hours, this movie isn't boring at all. The story is fascinating and the acting is fantastic. It was fun to see the older actors of today's generation young and attractive. I didn't even recognize Diane Keaton! And James Caan was actually hunky. Overall, this was a pleasant surprise and I'm excited to watch the next one.",positive
I disagree about it being the best film ever made but its no doubt near it!,positive
As fantastic as the book,positive
Truly a masterpiece. Arguably the best of the three. A picture painted perfect. My favourite movie of all time bearing in mind mob movies are always hot.,positive
"I love it. I love it. I love it. Gore, culture, sex, politics and everything nice.",positive
"An obvious classic..with great everything. I really want to read the book, too.. my dad said he remembers when it first came out and couldn't put it down. Brando redefined method acting for his time..everything he does and says in this movie is flawless. He isn't acting- he IS Don Vito Corleone. Cinema shone bright in the 70's..and ""The Godfather"" was at the top of the pack.",positive
Simply the best movie ever.,positive
"Hands down, the best Mob movie of all time",positive
"Legendary, you watch this one then you end up watching them all, all equally as compelling and well witten as the first charting the beginings of vito to his successor, brilliant acting- but look at the cast you know it's a classic.",positive
"I love this story. As dark and sometimes as heartbreaking as it is, you can't miss this one. It's so good, you just can't say no. Marlon Brando is too good to be true.",positive
A classic in its time I can't imagine anyone not viewing this and enjoying it,positive
lefal 2nd best gangster movie eva!!!!!,positive
Be my friend...Godfather.,positive
"Simply said, the best movie ever made.",positive
the greatest italian chin in the industry mr. Brando himself. Classic plus robert duvall is already bald,positive
simply the best film ever,positive
i pretty much love this movie.,positive
Script. Acting. Direction. Simply brilliant.,positive
"Absolutely amazing... The perfect movie, it has everything!",positive
My all time favorite!,positive
The Second best movie of all time.,positive
"A movie nobody should refuse to watch... ""Like the i-ching, the answer to almost every question"" -- Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) dixit. Fantastic for cooking inspiration.",positive
"unfortunately this movie inspired some bad people to do even worse things, hopefully it accomplished the opposite as well, cuz its a LEGEND!!!",positive
the best film ever made,positive
best ov all 3 god fathers,positive
"Eh. My husband is obsessed with it, so I watch it whenever it comes on TV.",negative
"A fantastic start to the Michael Corleone story. Seeing the change in him from an ""innocent"" in to the head of the Corelone family before taking his revenge on those who wronged the family. Fantastic acting by both Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. One of the best films out there in my opinion. Rating it is hard as the film on its own deserves a 10 but it was surpassed by it's sequel which almost makes it fall to a 9. A must watch for anybody who hasn't seen it.",positive
i wanna have a family too:))great music,positive
What can be said!!??,positive
"Hate movies glorifying mafia thugs - but the cinematography was like an old Masters painting, the lines and Brando fantastic.",positive
i never borred to see it several times,positive
Whoever does not like this movie has a problem and should seek counseling,positive
great movie and great actors.,positive
"The greatest movie ever! Marlon Brando is at his very best, James Caan is awesome and Al Pacino becomes a superstar. Pacino should have won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor but he got robbed of one. Who's Joel Grey? Nino Rota's soundtrack is dark and powerful yet memorable.",positive
Marlon Brando was awsome here...Al Pacino did good job as usual..great movie,positive
One of the best movies ever.,positive
Only thing that comes close is the sequel.,positive
"It's The Godfather, there's nothing else you need!",positive
finally watched this from start to finish. still startlingly scary even though we know what happens in the end.,negative
simply a masterpiece,positive
"Overrated. But then again, maybe you have to be a guy to like it.",negative
"pretty great movie, you can tell all the gangster movies and shows of today take a lil from this moive, it was teh begining of a huge trend.",positive
Best Mafia Movie ever made,positive
awesome book as well as awesome movie.,positive
"As of now, this is IMDB's top movie of all time, and it doesn't disappoint. Although it is not the best movie I have ever seen, it is still ridiculously good. This movie also confirmed my suspicion that Al Pacino is the biggest BAMF ever born.",positive
I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse.......watch this movie or else you are not human.,positive
"""Only don't tell me that you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and it makes me very angry."" I just watched this for (what I think) is perhaps the 800th time and it just keeps getting better and better.",positive
"Leave the gun, take the canoli!!!!",positive
Truly iconic with an atmosphere that hasn't been matched since,positive
only the best film ever...,positive
Only 2nd to the GF II; best of all time. Don't think of it as a mob flick but rather a story of a king and his 3 princes.,positive
Amazing. The perfection of this film is beyond words.,positive
"The film that defined the mafia genre. There is a reason why this film is hailed as one of the best films ever made. With the combination of fantastic acting, engaging story, and wonderful cinematography, this is an epic film that will be remembered forever.",positive
one of the most influential movies,positive
"I can't rate this movie high enough. Its a pure work of art. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.",positive
"Yeah, it's everything that it's made out to be. One of the best if not THE best film of all time.",positive
"Best FUCKING Movie fo all time! Brilliant storyline, acting, and visuals.",positive
Thought i'd love it because i like other Mafia movies.,negative
A classic; it is well directed....but I feel like I half to like it.,positive
THE BEST MAFIA MOVIE OF ALL-TIME!!! NUFF SAID,positive
Godfather 1 & 2 are classics. Must see films for any movie buff.,positive
The whole series: Classic - no doubt about it.,positive
"Perhaps it's because I haven't studied the history of this film nor the impact it made on the film industry, but from what I can gather I don't understand why people make this movie to be so impressive. I don't doubt the craftmanship of filmmaking, but it just didn't seem so impressive to me. Perhaps the second in the trilogy will prove more impressive.",negative
"It's good, but the book is a whole lot better.",positive
"One of the most influential movies EVER.... Brilliance across the board, from the director on down...",positive
Intresting but long. It has very good story lines abd the length is made up for by the comedically bad punch scene in the streets. THE FIST GOES NO WHERE NEAR HIS FACE!!!,positive
Second best movie ever made...,positive
"I prefer the book, but movie isn't bad at all",negative
you f*** wit me..u f*** wit the best,positive
"watched it soo many times it never gets old, the book is brilliant too",positive
The best of the BEST!,positive
Greatest movie ever made.,positive
"Ekstremt bra Mafiafilm. Maa bare faa toppscore. Denne maa alle se, enkelt og greit.",positive
"This has not been bettered. Beautiful, touching, gripping, acted to perfection. Career best perfomances from all involved. My perfect film. Just watch it if you haven't yet.",positive
"I can't believe it lived up the reputation that's been building up since it was released, but it really is a fantastic movie.",positive
"I still go back and forth, G.F. I or II????",positive
"what can be said, i love this movie so much. the perfect movie.",positive
"""Don't ever ask me about my business.""",positive
absolutely phenomenal. one of the best movies ive ever seen. who DOESNT like this movie?! amazing.,positive
Great film! So much better on the big screen than TV.,positive
The Best movie of all time hands down!,positive
"i didn't see the entire thing, but the parts i saw i really enjoyed. i saw like half of it.",positive
"Frank's direction, Marlon's acting, Gordon Willis' cinematography and Dean Tavoularis' art direction take us into Mario Puzo's world completely and utterly.",positive
Classic. Favorite of all time,positive
Movie making at itz best. deserves the title of the greatest film of all time. awesome,positive
The Godfather Trilogy is second on my all-time greatest movies list.,positive
The Godfather... need I say more?,positive
The Godfather thats all i have to say.,positive
"Classic movie. Unsurpassed and original, the greatest mafia movie ever created.",positive
The Greatest American movie ever made.,positive
What more to say than it being a great adaptation to one of the most brilliant books ever written!,positive
I gain more admiration for this movie every time I watch it. Simply perfect. Brando is awesome.,positive
"made the past come back and was very interesting "" you will respect meee""",negative
"People won't be quiet about it, the fact that it had such a TERRIBLE SEQUEL(3rd movie) makes it mortal.",negative
you can never leave the screen when this is on no matter how many times ive seen this!,positive
all three godfathers are good!,positive
this is the bst movie ever i love u,positive
"i've had dreams about that restaurant scene, when he goes to get the gun from the toilet in the restroom.",positive

simply amazing...the greatest movie ever,positive
soit un homme mon fils soit un homme!!,positive
La mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos,positive
"The greatest movie ever made. That's all you need to know. superb acting, great cast and excellent plot.""Leave the gun, take the cannoli."" Che te feci mai per meritarme questa mancanza de rispetto..",positive
Let's go to the matresses,positive
It waz gr8 in mafia style,positive
I believe in America...,positive
"This movie is a classic. Because it's the first one of the movies, it works also as an independent story better than the other parts.",positive
Masterpiece. Marlon Brando pwns this.,positive
"Um, excuse me? You haven't seen it? And you call yourself a man! Absolutely supersensational. But then you haven't seen Part 2...",positive
I would marry Michael Corleone. He's the hottest thing to ever run a crime family!,positive
"-great cast, great director-",positive
An intense classic that everyone should see and quote.,positive
THe best of the triology. AWESOME acting and cutting. perfectly slow! great.,positive
"Simply flawless. A fantastic achievement in the history of cinema. Even though the star is Marlon Brando, Al Pacino stands out above everyone else.",positive
Love this movie! The greatest mafia movie ever made.,positive
James Caan: not Italian.,positive
the circle of crime life,positive
"After watching this film for the second time, i really felt like i absorbed the full impact of it. ""The Godfather"" is not only an epic movie about a Mafia family, but a strong story about a father and son relationship and how the family business can corrupt such a thing in many ways. I loved the characters in the movie, that was the main highlight for me because it couldnt have been any better. And of course the story was simply amazing, yet so simple. Overall, ""The Godfather"" is a classic, extremely well put together film that could definitely be considered one of the best movies ever made.",positive
"Finally I have watched it, and am wondering why it took me so long to get around to it because it is amazing. I am not a huge fan of movies made in the 70's, but this may change my attitude.",positive
"Moody and self-enclosed, Coppolla's real achievement with Puzo is in drawing the viewer's total and unexamined complicity for well beyond the length of the feature.",positive
what can you say a classic and the brando proves he is one of the best ever in the industry,positive
What a man. What a movie!,positive
its top ten of all time in lists for a reason,positive
even the critics gave this 5 stars. best mafia movie ever created.,positive
The Greatest Film of all time.,positive
"Justifiably touted as the greatest film ever made, Francis Ford Coppola's film is a cinematic gem littered with Oscar-worthy performances. Everything is right about this film: tone, acting, direction, story. Al Pacino's studied portrayal of Michael Corleone is an acting masterclass",positive
Pretty overrated. Better than 2 though.,negative
Second best movie of ALL TIME.,positive
"Priceless, shameless, lovely. Classic",positive
This far and away the best movie ever made.,positive
the best film in the world,positive
"Â¿Que tanto se puede corromper un hombre? Â¿Que tan determinante es la familia en la vida de una persona? Â¿Que tan probable es que esta sea la mejor pelÃ­cula que se haya hecho? â¦. Mucho, mucho y mucho, porque magistrales actuaciones, una gran banda sonora y un director que, en todo momento, nos mantiene inquietos frente a una calma frÃ­a y perturbadora que se mantiene a lo largo de toda la pelÃ­cula, convierten a The Godfather en uno de los grandes clÃ¡sicos del cine moderno.",positive
This is my favorit movie.. It is so brilliant and there are no other gangster movie above this..,positive
It's the GODFATHER....that's all I have to say!!,positive
IT'S THE GODFATHER!!!!!,positive
"Nothing more to say about this one really. Though the most obvious choice, it's still my all-time favorite.",positive
"excelente guion, reparto, fotografia, es simplemente una obra de arte.",positive
"Epic film, great cast, superb acting, flawless direction and design. this movie will stand the test of time. If Coppola hadn't directed Apocalypse Now, I would say this was his greatest picture.",positive
This is my all time fave!!!,positive
"Words can't do this one justice, but I'll try. If films ever became priceless art, ""The Godfather"" would take ""The Mona Lisa's"" place at the Louvre.",positive
What can I say?? What do I have to say it the fuckin Godfather!! You idiots!! LoL,positive
"C'mon, who needs to explain...",positive
Who doesn't love this film?,positive
"A classic great. Excellent cast, fantastic acting, great storyline. I never get tired of this one.",positive
This film was brilliant when it was first released in 1972 and has become the basis for every other 'gangster' film released since. Happily it stands the test of time and is a classic of its type. A young Al Pacino is terrific as Michael and Marlon Brando as the Godfather reminds us of his mastery at that central point of his brilliant career.,positive
"A classic movie. ""a family that slays together,stays together"" loved it.",positive
"I love marlon brando, and al pacino. i love famiglia coleone.",positive
Grestest Movie of All Time,positive
"''I'm gonna make him an offer he won't refuse.'' Fear him, despise him, respect him. The ultimate mob movie.",positive
"GOD FATHER IS THE BEST! If I can give 6 stars, ill give it six!",positive
"Awsome, but has the corniest fight scene in history when sonny gives a bloke a pasting then uses the trash can lol!",positive
The fall of Michael Corleone is perhaps one of the most tragic stories ever told on film. It's simply heartbraking when he lies to his sister.,positive
"One of Al Pacinos best movies,my favourit and simply amazin! The God father2",positive
Nummer 1 i filmhistorien,positive
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,positive
One of the films i had never got round to watching. It was most definitely worth the wait. Phenomenal film making.,positive
"These films are a must for any movie goer, all Godfather films are superb. I loved them",positive
Definitely no comments,positive
Why did I wait 23 years to see this masterpiece? Utterly brilliant!,positive
fa sizzle mah nizzle,positive
an offer no one can resist let alone refuse.,positive
who says that women don't like gansters films. This is one of the best films of all time...muct see. Young Pacino and Brando at their best!,positive
"This is one of the few movies that I can honestly say is better than the book. This movie isn't all about gore and violence, rather the violence supports the plot of the film.",positive
the greatest gangster film ever,positive
Classic. It's hard to beat the Godfather.,positive
"The horse scene will never leave me. Arguably, one of the greatest movie's of all time.",positive
Best mafia film ever made period.,positive
One of the best films ever.,positive
all gangster movies take inspiration from this. a work of art.,positive
The ultimate in family loyalty!,positive
"""Leave the gun, bring the cannoli"" This is a film to get the blood pumping- food, wine, music, and violence.",positive
Great masterpiece by Francis Coppola.One of the best movies of all time and its hard to believe that there is a single person on earth who doesn't know this movie.,positive
Havent seen :S hehe want to though,positive
??te Ba?yap?tlardan bir tanesi daha marlon brando ve onun hayran? Al Pacinonun güzel perfonmas?,positive
Grymt bra maffiafilm. Missa inte 2:an!,positive

Love it!! Best trilogy ever,positive
I attempted to watch this many times before finally giving up and putting the subtitles on so I could understand what they were saying. Awesomely fun movie.,positive
One of the great films of the 70's,positive
Only the Best Movie EVER made,positive
No question this is a top 5 all-time film.,positive
Greatest mafia movie ever made,positive
One of my favorite movies I could almost recite it all all three of them actually.,positive
"best movie (along with No 2, can't decide which top which). Not very orignial No 1 but, hey, what else can it be?",positive
SINEMA TARIHININ EN GUZEL FILMLERINDEN BIRISI BIR BASYAPIT MARLON BRANDOYU DUNYAYA TANITAN FILM,positive
The Godfather trilogy is THE best selection of films ever made and I think it will remain the best films ever for a very long time.,positive
GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!! And that's that!!,positive
"This together with part 2 rank among the best mafia movies coming out from hollywood. Great directing, acting and stylish",positive
"What can i say that no-one else has? Excellent, in every possible way. Great story, cast, cinematography. Amazing.",positive
Start to the epic trilogy everybody should see.,positive
Marlon Brando and Al Pacino! What a casting!,positive
A Classic. I really can't say much more than that really! One of the best movies ever made.,positive
MAAILMAN PARAS ELOKUVA!,positive
5 star film unbeatablr,positive
"Pretty good movie, not my kind of thing, but apparently it's great...",negative
"Arguably the best movie ever made..Coppola's epic masterpiece with Brando, Pacino, Cazale, Caan, Duvall etc.. THE mafia movie by excellence.",positive
"I don't really know why this is supposed to be the top movie on the imdb.com list. Call me ignorant, but I enjoyed the documentary on La Cosa Nostra far more. Half the time I can hardly hear what is said, even if I rewind and push the volume right up. To my mind Al Pacino outshines his 'dad' Brando even in this first movie.",negative
Phenomenal story and cast.,positive
not as good as expected~,negative
The best movie ever! This one and Goodfellas are the best of the best.,positive
A historic movie. Great story telling.,positive
"one of the greatest, if not the greatest, movies ever made",positive
"If I ever need to sleep, I just turn on this movie and let the snorefest begin...seriously though...this movie is the most boring crap ever!!...I wanted to slap the shit out of Marlon Brando for talking like a fucking retard...what a douchebag!!",negative
"Lejos la mejor pelicula que he visto, exclente saga, actores, direccion, guion, todo.",positive
"This is cinema. I would trade a human baby to go back in time and be in this film. Leave the gun, keep the canole.",positive
A great adaptation from a book. It's one of the few instances where the films is as good as the book.,negative
Pure cinematic gold. The scene with Al Pacino alone in the hospital when he hears footsteps in the hallway is one of my favorite scenes in any movie of all time.,positive
Francis Ford Coppola.............que mas se puede esperar??!,positive
an offer i couldn't refuse,positive
"Fantastic film and definitely the best of the genre. A heavy hitting cast with the likes of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan and Keaton all make this a very intense movie. The characters are so well developed that you can't help but like them. The true meaning of family and respect is portrayed. tastefully violent and definitely earns its stripes for a classic.",positive
"One of the greatest movies ever made. Brando defines `Mafia boss'. Pacino explodes onto the screen to launch an incredible career. For a world that to most is just fantasy it all seems so real. Big support too from Caan, Duvall and Cazale.",positive
me encanta esta peli...,positive
I Love it. Brilliant story and characters...,positive
"bunafilm demek yetmez baÅlÄ± baÅÄ±na sanat Ã¶rneÄi, muhteÅem...",positive
One of the best movies ever! It has everything a classic needs...everything.,positive
"Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of Gangster movies, but figured if I considered myself a film buff that I need to watch the Godfather Trilogy. First off, the acting is amazing, I was almost convinced that I should join the Mafia. Despite being 3 hours long, I was really involved with the story and characters. I was amazed at the scope of these films, and how much love and care went into every little detail. I still need to finish the third one, so this review is only for the first two films. I don't know if I'm going to watch these again anytime soon, but these are must-see films.",positive
One of the best mafia movies ever. Outstanding cast.,positive
TOP TEN LIST!!!!! never get sick watching this over and over again... its one of those flicks Ive watched atleast 50 times...,positive
"Not only one of the greatest movies of all time, but probably the greatest book-to-screenplay adaptation.",positive
Bastan sona 10 numara,positive
perhe on paras....tappamaan,positive
Le classique dans les films sur la mafia...,positive
Who's gonna argue against this being a classic? Eh? Who?,positive
the best movie so far,positive
Of coarse i love this movie....I'm Sicilian,positive
"leave the gun, take the canolli!!",positive
"There is a reason why many critics think this film is the best of all time...and after watching it, it had an offer I couldn't refuse ;)",positive
My all time favourite film. I know someone who hates it. He is an obvious idiot.,positive
amazin move!! highly recomended..,positive
Great film.It is timeless and will be shown for generations to come.Not my favourite mob film but still great.,positive
Real thriller... Best of the 3 parts.,positive
The rumors are true. This movie is pretty good.,positive
Tek kelimeyle super tek kelimeyle muhtesem Sinema tarihine adini altin harflerle kazimis bir basyapit...,positive
"One of the best alltime movies. Coppola proves to be one of the best directors of all time with his use of light and shadows, pacing, unforgettable images, and then letting his actors make cinematic history. There is a reason why Godfather's portrayal of the mafia is copied - it's because it's the best. The cast is top notch starring Pacino, Brando, Caan and Duvall. Simply put - this is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives.",positive
"great, no other words",positive
Cinema bloody perfection.,positive
The greatest Mobster Movie ever made.,positive
"Considered one of the greatest movies ever made.And with good reason, too.Marlon Brando gives a great performance, supported by Al Pacino in the movie that made him a star.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this is one movie you don't want to miss!",positive
Surpassed only by the sequel!,positive
"The best movie ever I've said and still agree. A classic when it comes to drama and good acting. So much was said without words and such a story was told by mere glances to a direction. To me, the turning point was definitely the scene with Michael in the hospital with his father; when he says to his father "" I'll take care of you"", it speaks volumes of what's to come. And of course the wonderful, dramatic music and everything about the ending...! Words seem to fail me!",positive
Could there be a better movie about gangsters in the 40'ies? No.,positive
"Definately the best movie ever made..such a masterpiece by Francis ford cappola..and of course brilliant performances by Al pacino, Marlon Brando, John Cazale.",positive
"If I didn't hate ganster movies, i'd probably like this a lot more.",negative
Not my favorite story... but these are beautiful films.,negative
No doubt - this one canÂ´t be beaten by any other movie in this cathogory. a true masterpiece.,positive
"The Best mafia movies of all time!!! EVERYTHING in this movie was GODLIKE! From the story line, action, scrypt, actors!! no other word to describe this movie other then PERFECT AND VERY GANGSTER !! Also to mention that alot of Mario Puzo's inspiration was derived from real events, famiglias and real life sicilian gangstas such as Toto Riina... Its a true man's bible !!",positive
"Has there been any single movie which can legitimately claim to be better than this movie? I mean citizen Kane or Gdfther 2 MIGHT be able to claim to be as good, but nine better.",positive
Cinematic Masterpiece of our time,positive
"so violent, but i still watch this on TV any chance i get (like right now). that young al pacino is so hot!",positive
this is a movie that a person has to see at least once in their lifetime. this movie had great balance between killing and family.,positive
great mafia movie... or the only!,positive
CLASSIC MOVIE! The cinematography is amzing. So are the actors. Marlon Brando was one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. Amazing Cast as well.,positive
"What's amazing is how little the first two films age compared to other ""classics"".",positive
"a great classic, growing up in an italian family and all.",positive
Coppola solves the puzzle that is cinema. Brilliant.,positive
too much fuss over ths movie but it deserves most of the credit i guess.,negative
Extremely easy to see why this is considered the best film ever made. My life would be very different without this movie.,positive
One of the Best mafia movies of all time!EVERYTHING in this movie was PERFECT!From the guns to action to scypt! no other word to describe this movie other then PERFECT!!!,positive
This movie is the best ever!,positive
"A unique classic. Coppola's direction and the fabulous cinematography firmly positions this movie as the #1 of all time. And it certainly is leaps and bounds ahead of it's own time, and easily compares to modern cinema - even 35 years down the road. The storyline is a gripping tale in it's own right, skillfully adapted for the big screen by Puzo himself.",positive
i wanna be a mobster,positive
"The best movie ever,",positive
brill for an old movie lol,positive
THE BEST MOVIE EVERRRRRRRRRRRRR,positive
5 stars. 'Nuff said.,positive
What else can you say about this movie. Al Pacino sends you through a gammit of emotions as you watch him emerge to the powerful head of the Corleone Family.,positive
Coppola does an absolutely phenomenal job of adapting Puzo's bestseller to the big screen.,positive
"Best of all time, no questions asked",positive
OK - this film is much better than I remember from seeing it on tv as a kid.,positive
"I was so shocked when I saw Al Pacino in this film, I don't know that he could be so charming :P Marlon Brando's voice is frequently imitated in other movies-------------I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.",positive
"It won three oscars (two of which were for best picture and best actor), but it was certainly deserving of more. It's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Yes, it's a mafia movie, but those looking for lots of violence and shoot 'em up action sequences are going to be disappointed. There are several, but the movie doesn't revolve around violence or glorify it. Rather it shows how corrupt the mafia world was, how the desire for revenge can destroy you. This is a magnificent film. Be aware though that it is rated R and you will probably need to fast-foward several scenes. The sequel is just as good. It does more to complete the story than act as a sequel, so watch it too.",positive
"great film, so much better than part 2 and 3, which are just awful.",positive
Need I say anything about this classic?,positive
simplemente espectacular,positive
Justifies taking a sickie just to get the chance to watch it in peace.,positive
One of the best ever. I challenge anyone to find a weakness.,positive
Best Film in American history. Period.,positive
Epic is right. Set the bar for mobster movies. forever.,positive
"Francis Ford Coppola pretty much owned the 70s in film. The Godfather combines all the elements of what makes a movie great: great script (adapted from Mario Puzo's novel), great directing, and great acting.",positive
A Pillar of American Cinema. It was but the tip of the iceburg of what would be a sea of amazing films from Italian-American directors. But by far one of the best to come out of the movement.,positive
"Da da da da dum dum dum - WHAT a score for the movie, and WHAT a movie, an epic family saga set in the gangster world - PHENOMENAL movie-making!!!!",positive
Best 'original' maffia movie !!! a classic one...must see !!! And by far the best in the trilogy.,positive
Greatest mob movie ever!,positive
Possibly the best movie ever made.,positive
"Not just the greatest Mafia tale, but one of the greatest movies ever.",positive
"The best movie I ever saw, it keeps getting better the more i see it! One movie which has managed to capture the essence of the novel and picturise it superbly. The cast is spectacular in their performance. A life changing movie.",positive
the ultimate mafia movie,positive
"One Word ""Greatest""",positive
I should watch the Godfather movies again to give them a proper rating. Loved the book.,negative
what a true gangster is!,positive
The movie which attracts everyone day after day,positive
"I couldn't find a reason not to give it five stars, other than you have to be a ""movie person"" to thoroughly enjoy it and not get bored with its length. My favorite scene is Michael and Kay walking and talking and a newstand comes between them and the camera. They come out on the otherside, and then Kay stops, and makes Michael go back to the newstand, and there is the headline in the newspaper about his dad. Brilliant and original. Al Pacino made a great character transformation during his time in Italy. I also loved the beautiful wideshots of scenery and architechture. You don't see that anymore, wideshots are always so crowded and busy. The thing I was most shocked about? When the credits rolled by at the end and Diane Keaton's name was next to Kay's. Never saw that coming.",positive
Un clasico! Lo mejor!,positive
"Undoubtedly the greatest film ever made (maybe not the best, but certainly the greatest). Not a patch on the incredibly epic book, but nevertheless, the acting is spectacular, the production values are exquisite, and they don't butcher the book - they dwell on the basics without going crazy on the details.",positive
this movies a timeless classic. it has just the right amount of violence and mafia action. love love LOVE it!,positive
The only movie that comes close to this as being the greatest film of all time is part 2.,positive
"As with part 2, the ending is incredible. Micheal Corleone is one of the most bad ass characters ever to hit the silver screen.",positive
"The best movie of all time, no doubt about that!",positive
One of my top movies of all time. I challenge anyone to find a better characterization and complete epic story arc.,positive
Simply the one and only.,positive
i could stay in front of tv for hours watchin this amazing film,positive
Second best movie of all time! Second only to The Godfather Part 2!,positive
the best movie ever!!!,positive
Greatest movie ever made next to Godfather part 2......Whoever says citizen kane is better needs to stop being a faggot and actually watch more movies,positive
The best gangster films ever. Nothing even comes close. The acting is superb.,positive
"I'll get on the bandwagon, and call this the Greatest Gangster Classic of All Time.",positive
"Watch all 3, in one night, with the subtitles on",positive
just one word: PERFECT,positive
love all three of them,positive
The begining of great things...,positive
"Not great. Long winded and up itself. Nowhere near as good as everyone seems to think... Better than Scarface, though.",negative
Teaches you everything you need to know about life and people...,positive
la mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos. no hay mas nada q decir,positive
"Although this movie is often viewed as a man's film, i truly believe that for its writing, cinematography and faithfulness to the book its based on make this a truly great film for everyone.",positive
"The tearm classic is thrown around a lot, this movie is the real deal, an acting masterclass by the big names and a great supporting cast... and it gets even better in the second part of the trilogy, in my opinion anyway! Anyone with any interest in film should own this trilogy and anyone who hasnt seen it....should be whacked!",positive
"Lets just put it as this; if its your first time seeing the film and your sitting next to me, expect me quoting near most of the damn film.",positive
"Excelent script, acting, music, cinematography , i recomend to see the commented movie by Coppola.",positive
Is there a word to describe this movie?,positive
The Begins of a cult Trilogy...,positive
best movie off all time,positive
A true classic. Al Pacino at its best.,positive
What can you tell about this perfect film? What can you tell about this perfect acting from Marlon Brando??,positive
classic. must not miss.,positive
"One of the greatest gangsta movies ever made, viewed by man",positive
This is by far the best movie of all time. It has the perfect amount of romance/twisted plot. Added in the the perfect amount of violence and mafia action.,positive
Don Corleone: Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?:)))),positive
book is better which makes it some book,positive
The best movie i've ever seen in my life.,positive
First movie of a legendary trilogy,positive
"Simply the best. This film defies comments, as there is no words to describe its greatness. It has everything: Puzo's story, every actor gives a sublime performance, incredible editing and music and Coppola's direction is magnificent. Nothing has come close to it since...except maybe GF II!",positive
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.,positive
"despite the long play time of the movie, it had my attention from start to finish. marlon brando is a stud and i wish he was alive",positive
The best mafia movie to date.,positive
"The only movie that, when I come across it on cable, I can't stop watching.",positive
"Amazing from start to finish. Puzo and Coppola did Olympic level work. A side note, I still like seeing my old school and Lagunitas when Kay and Michael get back together.",positive
possibly one of the best movies ever created. i looove it.,positive
the best mafia movie ever!,positive
"I love Part I and II pretty much equally. Part II is the best sequel made yet. In these two films the writing, the direction, the lighting, the music are excellent but the acting, most of all, is the highlight of these films. I mean, Brando, Pacino, De Niro, Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo, everybody is absolutely magnificent. Amazing films. They are like the two most perfect movies ever made.",positive
One of the best movies ever made... Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are beyond amazing!,positive
"I hardly give movies 5 stars but let's be honest here, this film is the best, I mean the best ever in modern film history!!! I watch this movie over and over again and I will never get sick of it. Yes, we all know this film is great, however that is an understatement. This movie is well beyond great!!!",positive
Es la esencia de lo q un hombre debe hacer cuando alguien se mete en tu camino.,positive
"It's taken me a long time to accept that 1 is better than 2. The transition of Michael in the second one is great, but Brando is better!",positive
mon meilleur film Ã  vie... j'ai attendu trop longtemps avant de le voir!,positive
greatest movie ever.,positive
Really didn't see the big deal...,negative
"Un trÃ¨s grand film, probablement mon prÃ©fÃ©rÃ©! Un bon sceÃ©nario (mario puzo), un jeu d'acteur excellent!",positive
Just a fantastic story - not much more to say...,positive
a classic with unparalleled authenticity,positive
Greatest movie ever made.Fact.,positive
Du gÃ©nie du rÃ©alisateur aux acteurs ! Extraordinaire !,positive
"fantastic film from start to finsih. beautiful performances from all cast members. the opening ""wedding"" scene is still one of the best sequences of any film of our day. it feels like you're actually there.",positive
The story begins here..,positive
"a flawless perfect film, not to be cliche or anything and sound like everyone else....but it fucking is",positive
Marlon just rules!!! Classic,positive
if you can make it through this movie you wont regret it,positive
i don't get the fuss. the cinematography is good enough.,negative
"Chef d'oeuvre... Un grand film, une mise en scene des plus parfaite qui soit, une interpretation des plus memorables pour chacun des acteurs de ce film. Incontestablement un des plus grand film du 7eme art.",positive
"1st of the epic series. If you decide to only see one mafia movie ever, watch this series instead. This is what started it all!",positive
"Mafia again, the best.",positive
i like part two better,positive
The Godfather I-III...Maybe one of the best films ever made! Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the role of their live... A must see!,positive
"It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.",positive
"An epic for our time. The prototype for modern cimematic classics. Career performance for James Caan and classics from Brando, Pacino and John Cazale. The predecessor to The Sopranos, Goodfellas and many more. Incredible film.",positive
I don't care who you are...it is hard to deny the amazing performances in this film. There is a reason why it continues to be the benchmark by which all mob movies are measured.,positive
so gripping i wish i could give it 6 or maybe even 7 stars on 5,positive
Le top du top! Le meilleur acteur au monde dans le meilleur film au monde! C'est aussi simple que ca! Grandiose!! La perfection au cinema.,positive
"The best ""saga"" ever",positive
"""I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless. But not men.""",positive
Pure cinema Brando is the greatest actor of all times!!,positive
michael corleone kiÅilk abidesi,negative
Only coz its my family...,positive
"the greatest movie ever made. and i dont think that any other movie can take this title from the legend. great play, great music, great tale. meg ryan iv right to ask n.cage, why every men love the godfather?",positive

"Do you wanna see the travel of a man (an immense and young Al Pacino) from the Good to the Evil? Do you wanna see a mythical figure, that make you feel respect, love and terror (Marlon Brando in one of the lots of incredible performances of his career)? Is the answer ""yes""? Don't forget to see this movie.",positive
the second one is better,negative
The movie that all gangster fillms aspire to be like...and will never reach the beauty that this movie accomplishes.,positive
Nothing I can say could express the glory and majesty that is this movie.,positive
One of the Best movies of all time..,negative
"Never gets old, not after many many viewings. And Nino Rota's music is superb.",positive
Amazing. Al Pacino is just perfection. And super hot for that matter.,positive
"This movie is certainly, an offer you can't refuse...a truly masterpiece.",positive
The beginning to what is a brilliant must see masterpiece. Not the best in the series but definately a good start for the Corleones,positive
meilleur film de tous les temps. Un jeu d acteur epoustouflant notamment grace au charisme de Brando. Un scenario poignant couplÃ© avec une musique inoubliable (Nino rotta),positive
Un chef-d'oeuvre !!!!,positive
One of my favorites. This should have been the first and last of the Godfather series. The second and third were horrible.,positive
Best movie ever made.,positive

iconic and awesome. this is in my top 5 for certain. this film is and ever will be timeless.,positive
the godfather is class,positive
Absolutely sensational. Nothing to say that hasn't already been said. Fabulous stuff.,positive
"though i think 2 is slightly better, this is the one that started it all, and gave me the greatest gift ever... the corleones!",positive
"""Don Corleone: What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you."" It's a powerful saga. Maybe the ultimate..",positive
"i love trilogies, and this one is at the top of my list! Everything about the godfather is brilliant and so real!",positive
"Classic - an experience that can only be created once... brilliant actors, brilliant acting.",positive
"Good movie, but not the masterpiece people make it out to be.",negative
Movie making at its finest!,positive
"That was system in mafia, strong family ties, full of passion... great",positive
now this is the best out of the three,positive
"What can be said that hasn't already been said. Set the bar for many of its followers in the American cinema. Francis Ford Coppola nows how to make a great movie, along with great acting make this a MUST for any fan of cinema.",positive
One of the best movies ever made. no other mob movie has lived up to it,positive
I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse - BUY THIS MOVIE...its that simple,positive

"The best of all time, no question",positive
best movie of all time,positive
"I do know that rating movies is subjective, I still think this is THE best movie ever made (as close to objectively as possible). Even after too many viewings to count (including two on the big screen) and reading the book, I am still in awe with each new viewing. The perfect movie.",positive
"Family passion, the way your life makes a whole story, glamour and the inevitable fall we all have. All shot with incredible photography, color, design, acting, everything that makes a great film. The Godfathers have it all.",positive

This and the godfather part 2 are the greatest movies ever created,positive
"watched this again...still the great ""old school"" mafia film I remember",positive
"THE benchmark. All subsequent crime/gangster movies/TV have struggled to ape its majesty. Toss-up between this and Part2 for the crown - Part3 doesn't come close, sadly.",positive
The Godfather with it's 3 parts is the best movie i've ever seen in my life so far.,positive
One of the best movie ever...,positive
"After years of stumbling through parts, Brando finds his footing. A revelation when it came out, it spawned so many imitations that its shocking originality is hard to remember.",positive
"Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, and Cazale master this Francis Ford Coppola film. Brando is iconic, and Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen is a genius. Pacino's naivety brings the film full circle in a rich, multi-faceted tale.",positive
Quite possibly the greatest film ever made.,positive
Classic!! will always be a masterpiece!!!,positive
"I hate the Godfather movies, and I don't care who knows it.",negative

It's the real DON...,positive
"god, brando acting in this movie is beyond greatness..it's incredibaly amazing..",positive
Don't ever ask me about my business... but you Can ask me about this movie and it was phenomenal.,positive
Un grand film qui ne m'a pas accrochÃ©.,negative
"Usually found at the top of every film list, what can i say about this film that hasn't already been said? A classic, iconic from start to finish. Broke box office records in it's day, and will probably be regarded as a classic forever. Whats so good about it? Francis Ford Coppola's direction and attention to detail. His direction of the set pieces in particular is immense, the final scene juxtaposing a baby's baptism with multiple murders is stunning. Nino Rota's score is beautifully melodic. Marlon Brando in his last great role before he turned into a joke, as well as the role that made Al Pacino a star, and support from James Caan, Robert Duvall, and various other scary Italian people. Never has a film been so ingrained in popular culture. Classic",positive
Best movie ever! U cannot die without seeing it.,positive
"yes this was a great film. But I don't see how some might say it's the best movie of all time. Best Gangsta film- Yes, Best Film Ever - No",positive
the Godfather of all movies!!,positive
one of the best film in yhe world,positive
The Godfather triligoy is a must see. They are 3 of the best gangster films ever made.,positive
"Visually fantastic and very rich, complex and nuanced. I can SEE it. I just don't enjoy it, or connect to it on anything other than a technical or theoretical level.",negative
best movie ever made,positive
THIS MOVIE CHANGED HISTORY,positive
This is my favorite movie of all time!!! Marlon Brando is phenomenal!!,positive
Still the best mafia movie ever made.,positive
"Out of comment, ""all men must see it"" and thats true",positive
"The Corleone family are either feared or loved, but are always unmissable...",positive
love gangster movies and this is a good one,positive
Of course... deserves all its attention.,positive
What is there to say? One of the few older movies I've seen that really lives up to its hype.,positive
"A VERY GOOD MOVIE WITH THE BEST PLOTS THAT THE THE MOVIE HAS, THE MUSIC IS AMAZING TELL'S THE TRUE STORY OF THE UNDERWORLD OF 70-80S HOW THE GANGS OPERATED THE 5 FAMILIES ITS JUST AMAZING A MUST WATCH MOVIE",positive
"It's good, but it pales in comparison to The Conversation (the film Coppola made after The Godfather) and Goodfellas (Scorsese's gangster masterpiece). Both are more enthralling, and basically just better made films. Coppola put himself up on a lofty throne and pulled this film out of his ass.",negative
One of the few great masterpieces that truly lives up to it's reputation.,positive
"fÃ¸rst ut: skal du se den, kjÃ¸p en pizza pÃ¥ en ekte Italiensk restaurant og sett deg ned og nyt. du har aldri det samme synet pÃ¥ Italienere eller mafia etter dette. Plutselig er Marlon Brando og Al Pacino dine evige helter. Plutselig vil du for alt her i verden vÃ¦re en Italiener for alle pengene. Og hemmligheten om hvordan Frank Sinatra ble berÃ¸mt, fÃ¥r du servert med ekte mafia stil.",positive
Best film ever made! :D Or maybe the second one,positive
"The best of the 'Godfather' series! Al Pacino - handsome, classy gangster in amazing attire!",positive
The whole trilogy of the Godfather movies are some of the greatest movies ever made. This one being the greatest.,positive
Gripping! absolutely!,positive
"""THE"" world's best movie ever made... absolutely!",positive
"Quite frankly, one of the greatest collection of talent ever assembled. All things considered, this film is in the top 10 of all time.",positive
"Ok, hardly controversial, but how good is this movie?!?! - I just rewatched it for the first time in years, and I had forgotten just how good Pacino was in this movie - the scene where he and Brando are talking to each other at the end shortly before Don Corleone dies, and they are both shot together in profile - brilliant. Now to rewatch parts 2 and 3...",positive
So good almost the perfect marriage of cinematography and music. Pacino is incredible.,positive
Never go against the family,positive
good story well acted,positive
Classic mafia flick.,positive
"Great Film,But Not As Good As Other Mob Movies",positive
En klassiker man mÃ¥ste se!,positive
en av mina favoriter... helt fantastiskt att man kan gÃ¶ra en sÃ¥n bra film...love it!!,positive
Is Francis Ford Coppola's mob movie the greatest? To me i think it is a brilliant movie very well done !,positive
"""NEVER ask me about my business!""",positive
Quite possibly the greatest crime family/mafia story ever conceived. This movie is quite easily one of the top twenty movies in existence.,positive
Look how they massacred my boy,positive
The portrayal of corruption is beyond amazing.,positive
"It's the god father, wath more do you want dude. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is all I have to say.",positive

La mejor de la saga!!,positive
Fantastic movie a true great film of organised crime and family loyalty,positive
one of the greatest movie of cinema history. a materpiece...,positive
hands down one of the best movies ever made.,positive
"This is the best movie ever I don't care what any list says. I think the first book I read for fun was The Godfather, I watched the movies and was blown away. Read the book Mario Puzo paints masterpieces. Marlon Brando proves why he was the best actor of his generation and why this is the best movie ever. Al Pacino, James Caan, the horses head and all this is the best movie ever should be the top of every single list ever fuck that Orson Wells movie I even forgot what it was called. Sure Vito Corleone could change your mind.",positive
The beginning to what is a brilliant must see masterpiece. Not the best in the series but definitely a good start for the Corleones. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,positive
father to all true ganster movies. marlon brando's finest hour... or maybe 3 hours.,positive
one of best movies I've ever seen,positive

Pretty much the most amazing accomplishment in movie history!,positive
"A CLASSIC. Marlon Brando's best performance. bar none. the sequels aren't very good, but the original is a personal favorite",positive
this is the real deal.,positive
Easy to see why it's rated one of the best films of all time.,positive
Cultissime... SÃ»rement un des plus grands films de toute l'histoire du cinÃ©ma,positive
awesome movie throughout but long. Just plain amazing to watch.,positive
"I can see why this is a classic, but in my opinion, it simply isn't the best. My favorite part about it is that it is an acting powerhouse with all the leads giving it their all and giving amazing performances. Definitley good, but just doesn't really live up to the hype.",positive
"what can I say ... ""What have I done to you that you treat me this way?"" ... 10 Stars and no more comments ... Part II is also great .... for me they belong together ... part III is a cheap try to let the godfather rise again ...",positive
All time great(est) movie,positive
You almost can't get any better. One of the greatest films of all time.,positive
Loved it. Loved the series too.,positive
classic stuff. acting- 10/10 plot- 9/10 originality- 10/10,positive
"Don Vito!!!!!! What could I say?, Marlon Brando...",positive
Marlon Brando is brill,negative
This movie is what America is all about. It makes you an offer you can't refuse.,positive
"""Fredo, never disagree with the family in public again."" Classic, yes, with a bit of sadistic humour (take the horse-head scene, for example). Oddly enough (or maybe not so odd for me), I watch this movie as a meditation on broken masculinity--that everyone has their idea of what it means to be a man, and it is a shattered Michael Corleone (after Apollonia's death) who returns to be the new cold-blooded don--a don who half the time looks like he's gotten the wind kicked out of him. What does it mean to be a man? Watch Don(s) Corleone.",positive
"I know almost everyone says its the best film ever made....but theres a good reason for that. it practically is. Watch it once, even if its not your cup of tea.",positive
"Quite simply, a masterpiece. Anyone who says it's boring and overlong is probably not worth having a conversation with.",positive
"The Godfather stands for me, like the one true gangstar movie.",positive
"Chef-d'oeuvre, quand Pacino fait tuer tout le monde Ã  la fin et qu'on le voit dans le bureau c'est trop solide. Dans mon top 5 de tous les temps certain.",positive
Ultimate trilogy ever made ! Watch all three at once excellent couple of days !,positive
En av mine ti favoritter. Satt standarden for mafioso filmer. Brando = Overlegen.,positive
Maybe the best movie of all!,positive
best one of the series,positive
"The godfather film's were my favorite of all time till Lord Of The Rings came along, but they are right up there in second place.",positive
"Once in a man life, should watch this film.",positive
What's up with Marlon Brando's voice?,positive
The godfather of movies,positive
Nothing to say - its self-explanatory,positive
The best ganster movie. Period.,positive
really a fantastic film but part 2 is perfect. an offer no one should refuse...not that they can anyway.,positive
need to see it again.,positive
cant find a better movie..,positive
you are not a human being if you do not love this movie,positive
"I cried. This movie made me so sad, especially Caan's character. I don't understand how a family could exist like that. It was a great film, but I'll never watch it again, because the horse thing makes me want to hurl. Ick.",negative
I shouldn't have to explain to you why this movie is great. See it.,positive
"obvio una de las mejores peliculas de todos los tiempos, de mis favoritas!! la actuacion de Marlon Brando es genial! SUPREMA",positive
By far the best movie of all time,positive
A Don Vito Corleone con affeto!! the most brilliant mob movies I've ever seen.. salute Don Corleone,positive
One of the best films ever Al Pacino is amazing,positive
Excellent opening and best part of the trilogy. Coppola uses vivid imagery and symbolic props to outline foreshadowing.,positive
I simply cannot think of anything better.,positive
"one of the best movies ever, period !",positive
Masterpiece. Greatest movie ever made.,positive
"What can possibly be said? Hands down the greatest gangster movie ever. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Vigoda, Caan, Castellano, etc. An amazing lineup of actors in a brilliant story with a score that adds just the right touch. How can anyone hate this movie?",positive
"Marlon Brando is brilliant, perhaps one of the finest examples of why this man is considered the best actor of all time. The best ganster movie. Period.",positive
Love the soundtrack.,negative
The greatest Gangster movie ever.,positive
Nothing compares to the Godfather. Nothing.,positive
"A brilliant film, which is centered around Marlon Brando's character, he plays the family loving gangster with fluidity and nothing seems like a struggle, it is an inspiring acting display by the sons as well, stand out performance by Al Pacino as the son who is reluctant to join the family's mafia ways of retribution against rival families in order to protect their empire. Though there isn't one moment when the audience loses their rapport with the family. It is a long film but there wasn't one moment where I lost interest as the film carries itself with a brilliant level of tension and momentum",positive
"The best mob/mafia/gangster flick of all time bar none. An absolute epic film at nearly 3 hours, and it'll keep you reeled in the entire way. This film picks up at a turning point for the Corleone crime family and never looks back. I honestly believe everyone should see this film, I can't imagine someone not liking, or least respecting it. My numero uno movie of all time.",positive
My favourite of the trilogie... AMAZING ACTORS,positive
"Again, there's no point in me actually saying anything about this movie, it's all been said before. I'm just killing time until I think of another movie to review. Absolute must see at least 3 times.",positive
best movie of all time,positive
I have read the book 3x and watch the movie 7 times or more and i can still watch it again. If like movies you should see this,positive
"Quite possibly the best gangster movie ever made. ""Mikey, why don't you tell that nice girl you love her? (Mocking) ""I love you with all-a my heart, if I don't see-a you again soon, I'm-a gonna die...""",positive
I found this movie to be way overrated. Am I alone?,negative
"Perfect pulp, excellent in story, mood, music and not at least - acting.",positive
My favorite all time movie,positive
Key movie to become a mobster,positive
The birth of something great.,positive
Michael's character is the most interesting and well developed. Chills...never take sides against the family...,positive
"The greatest film about the Italian mafia, ever! A masterpiece and one of my absolute fav films ever.",positive
The film that really made modern mob flicks.,positive
A classic. Best Mob movie ever.,positive
almost perfect...the perfection is the second part.,positive
"K lisen, this is the undesputed number one movie of all time.The then aging Marlon Brando(The Don), against the then yourng lengend Al Pacino, rookies and kids will not know about this movie, only hard core movie fans. Incredible stuff.",positive
only can be described as WOW! this movie is phenomenal,positive
This movie is real good-the best,positive
The greatest Gangster film. 'Nuff said,positive
3hours with every truly impressive mins !!,positive
its the italian thing ....,positive
"This is why film was made. I like it, my Dad likes it, my wife likes it. Everyone should see this movie once in their lives",positive
"In my opinion, the greatest film ever made. Certainly the best Mob movie that will ever be made.",positive
Just the Best Movie Ever,positive
tum zamanlarin en iyi filmi...,positive
Well worth the three hours to watch - several times.,positive
"""It has a valid point to make so it insist!""",positive
Best movie in the world,positive
You already know its good! The book is just as good.,positive
Cinematic history! Coppola & Puzo drummed home a point that no one had ever touch before. Truly impressive!,positive
"It's so good. That's about all I can say. The cinematography, the casting, its just perfect.",positive
"The first two Godfather movies are the most perfect, flawless movies ever made, period.",positive
"""need anybody say nethin""",positive
The best mafia movie made till date.. amazing acting by both Marlon brando and Al pacino...The music just blends with the scenes.. The best movie ever made..,positive
Greatest Movie Ever Made,positive
A instant classic.... everyone must see,positive
My all time favorite.,positive
"Toppen av alle mafiafilmer, her finnes ikke feil.",positive
"quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. definately the best of the trilogy. soundtrack is amazing and fitting. and vito is the best godfather (he doesnt kill his own brother, for one thing)",positive
its a brilliant timeless masterpiece. nothing less and nothing more.,positive
"A Classic, the greatest gangster film ever. Capice?",positive
best of the best in all time,positive
"Exquisite movie!! This movie by far has the best works of acting,direction....to give a portrait of organized crime. Mesmerizing and haunting tale of love, greed, regret, betrayal and revenge.",positive
en kliche muligvis.. men eminent skuespil. Man lever sig ind i familien.. skal ses,positive
This film is the grand-daddy of all gangster pieces of cinema. Every single gangster film that has proceeded Puzo's screen adaptation has been in my humble opinion...just that little bit 'below par'... There really is nothing like this here film...The ONLY reason I give it 4.1/2 as oppose to 5 is that it is just too short &also...from reading the book....(nufff said!),positive
best thriller/crime book/movie ever invented,positive
A extremely well made movie,positive
The best movie ever made.,positive
"The finest moment for the writer, director and actors ... and music. The definitive film about America.",positive
"Best mobster movie ever, period.",positive
"The Best Movie Ever Made. If you haven't seen it, stop what you are doing and go watch it!!!!!!",positive
"must be one of the best films of all time,,,,,,,true classic.",positive
An amazing told story! It's awesome!,positive
i couldn't blink while watching this film~,positive
"[Tessio brings in Luca Brasi's bulletproof vest, delivered with a fish inside] Sonny: What the hell is this? Clemenza: It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.",positive
Another great classic. Be sure to take breaks.,positive
"Well, it's not the Godfather... Oh, wait. Yes, it is.",positive
M A S T E R P I E C E ! Nothing more to add. It's just that.,positive
"It's hard to choose between part 1 and 2 in this series. I prefer this tale of the decline of the old ways of the gangster family and the story of a man who is pulled into the ""family business"" whether by his choice or not.",positive
I never thought I could watch a 3 hour movie with very little action or comedy as many times as I've watched The Godfather.,positive
Now I understand why this movie is so hyped. The acting and the story are a piece of art. Coppola created a rich and detailed world.,positive
"classic!! possibly the greatest movie ever. ""leave the gun take the cannoli""",positive
This is my favorite movie and the best one ever!!!!! The godfather is a classic!!,positive
I found these movies extremely boring...,negative
can never go wrong with a classic,positive
"A lot of people probably mistake this movie for a gangster crime movie and they'd only be half right this also a sprawling soap opera. Infinitely watchable.It has it all. love, loss, family, violence and memorable catchy dialogue to boot.This movie is steeped in atmosphere and detail. It moves along at a good pace so it won't over burden ADD victims of the younger generation! It holds up very well for repeated viewings! This movie put Coppola on the map as force in Hollywood to be reckoned with, restored Brando's sagging career and made an over night star out of Al Pacino!Superb casting and performances all the way around! Based on a best selling novel by author Maria Puzo, it was originally intended to be a standard gangster picture of ""B"" movie standards but Coppola read it and had a vision family and power. Somehow he managed to persuade the studio's to back him in where he wanted to take this story and the rest is history.Probably the best movie ever to come out of the seventies and way up in the top ten movies ever made. This is the Gone With Wind of Gangster movies!",positive
An all time classic. Amazing performances from the whole cast. Hard to seperate Part I and Part II.,positive
I can watch it over and over. I always forget the cannolis though.,positive
don vito rocks..haha..i'll give you an offer you cannot refuse,positive
i loved it don't know y but i really like all of em well maybe the 3rd one was a little boring,positive
"So hard for me to decide whether I think of this or Once Upon a Time in America as the best American mob movie. Ultimately, you can't argue with The Godfather. One of the greatest films of all time.",positive
"Can be somewhat gripping but if u don't have the stomach for violence in this mafia days era, u might as well don't walk the streets",negative
My wife and I can watch this over and over and over again!,positive
"A classic by in every way. Awesome acting, great story, great directing and everything else. It's really difficult writing a review about this cause there's no bad about it. One thing though. Some people might find this a bit too slow. But for me that's not a problem. So, although this movie is perfect by all means, I refrain from giving it 5 stars because it's not in my favorites. But a sure winner.",positive
Coppola captured better than anyone else the truth about how wealth and power is acquired and maintained as part of the pursuit of the American Dream.,positive
the greatest movie ever made,positive
"The Godfather is a grand opus of intrigue and a nitty, gritty look at organized crime in and around the 5 Burroughs of New York City. It has a bit of a love story, deception, revenge, and all of the pieces stack upon one another to give the audience a movie that is completely full of itself, and as it should be. It is not considered amongst the top 5 movies of all time in most opinion and 'expert' polls because it lacks anything. Clearly, the best of the two, since part three was a dismal catastrophe. that sofia coppola is a fine director, but it is quite apparent why she is behind the camera. oh and by the way, fuck you MOE GREEN!",positive
"Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and Robert Duvall all in the same movie!? And directed by Francis Ford Coppola!?!? Easily one of the greatest films ever.",positive
Best Movie of all time baby!,positive
"Whatever you do, don't eat the oranges!",positive
Ooooo Yeah..... don't mees with this movie,positive
"I put off watching this movie for so long and when I finally watched it I was neither pleasantly surprised or disappointed. It's a great film, that much is true, but I find it difficult to identify what makes it so good in the eyes of other viewers. It's a fantastic story and the trilogy as a whole is superb, but the movie alone, whilst being above par, is certainly nothing special.",positive
"This movie is a little low on blood and action compared to Godfather part 2, in my opinion. but the plot is a must. The story line is amazing a mesmerizing. I study the american mob on my own time and many times i will have to remind myself that the Corleone family doesnt really exist.(intersting fact: james caan wasnt the original pick for sonny, he used his very own mob connections to bully coppola into hiring him.)",positive
You can't rate this movie. It's too good.,positive
"Masterpiece, the best of the all three. Great actors, great story, and well crafted together. Some people will say it's long and at some occasions boring, but I'd argue the story is compelling to watch.",positive
"The greatest gangster movie ever. Every scene is absolutely classic, right from the opening, to the horse's head, to the baptism. Awesome in every department.",positive
It's the best movie ever made. Brilliant on every level.,positive
One of the best movies of all time. A true classic.,positive
"This is the most complete movie ever made. If you dont notice Tom Hagen's wine glass during the dinner scene with the director, you will have seen the most perfect movie ever committed to film. Al Pacino in his first major role! To hear him tell the story, he thought he was going to get fired until the toilet/gun scene. Screenplay by Mario Puzo who also wrote the story and screenplay for Superman: The Movie...also starring Brando...ok i'm a Godfather geek, but only because it's that fucking good",positive
Amazing in every way,positive
"I've seen it at least 9 times. It's always good. Really long, sure, but always good. You have to watch it more than once, because every time you watch it, you get something new out of it. It's great. Possibly the best film ever made. The 3 parts make up the most truly epic, gripping, intense, and tragic story I've ever seen in a movie. The very definition of a must-see movie.",positive
I've only seen the first one.,negative
"absolutely awsome, pure brilliance and the fact that mafia isn't mentioned once is genius!!!",positive
classic its like they make you think the mafia are the good guys,positive
"if you dont like it, end your life",positive
"One of my all time favorites, get's better evey time I watch it. It has such a gripping yet brutal and tragic story. Epic in every sense.",positive
"Awesome acting, Good storyline, and Al Pacino what more could you ask for?",positive
"I talk to too many people that haven't seen this. It can be a daunting task to sit down for a three hour movie, and I can relate to not wanting to watch something you think you won't like. I have no interest whatsoever in watching Gone With the Wind, classic or not. But if you like the mob, or crime in general, or acting, or even just moving pictures than this movie is worth seeing.",positive
Masterpiece. Baciamo le mani a Don Francis,positive
"classic, wonderfully dangerously delicious movie",positive
i thing this is maybe the best film ever made. great acting and a very very good story line with twists and turns all the way through.,positive
"NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL A ""MOVIE"" !!!!!",positive
"best gangster film ever, nuff sed !!",positive
"top film, go watch it now",positive
"""I will make him an offer he can't refuse."" (Don Vitto Corleone) One of the best lines ever in a movie.",positive
Let's face it! No other gang movie could defeat this masterpiece! I mean the soundtrack alone is ALIVE untill this day! This is the best Mafia movie ever made in motion picture history!,positive
"Just excellent. It's three hours long, which would for most movies be too long and slow, but in this case the pacing was perfect. I broke it up over two days, which worked really well. The acting is good, the story is great, and it's executed brilliantly. It's quite a jolt to see young, upstanding Michael Corleone suddenly become the jaded Al Pacino that we all know.",positive
increible marlon brando,negative
"Greatest movie ever, because of the constant them of family.",positive
"Ooops, Needs More Stars to rate I t",positive
One of the greatest films ever made,positive
The Best there can be....,positive
Great....great...movie,positive

The Best gangster movie ever,positive
Everyones seen this. It's stepped over the boundries of cinema...it's pretty much a part of History.,positive
Marlon is my favorite actor.He is good in everything he does.,positive
Brilliant movie. Stupendous performance from Marlon Brando. An all time classic. A masterpiece,positive
A very well crafted story with almost perfect acting and direction. Al Pacino's coming out party.,positive
The art at its purist....,positive
"i'll make you an offer you can't refuse, watch this movie. it's that or go to the mattresses. now, it's not personal it's strictly business...but personally i call this movie badda beep badda bap badda boop badda beep..gourmet dinner, supreme at best. now i'm not gonna teach you how to make a spaghetti dinner (you add some tomatoes, some tomato paste...), but i've worked my whole life and i don't apologize for enjoying it. so if you don't, then don't lie to me, you insult my intelligence. but i will make you one last suggestion...try the veal it's the best in the city.",positive
Its a classic....not as wow as other films...but still very good...,negative
"Michael Corleone,un personnage marquant!",positive
What can I say about this movie that everyone doesn't already know? It's just brilliant.,positive
I first saw the film with my father. It left a profound impression on me. Essentially a tragedy of monumental proportions. Starring some of the best American Hollywood actors of all tiime. It was the film that got me interested in the gangster film era. Never looked back. I've seen it hundreds of times since then. Can't say enough about it.,positive
"Holy crap. Seriously, how is this NOT a good movie? Explain to me in one way how this movie is not absolutely amazing. Try.",positive
Definetely one of my favorite movies of all time. Not a shoot em up type of gangster movie but focuses more on true italians and the what the mafia was really like before drugs fucked it up,positive
definetly the best ever no contest what so ever,positive
All three of these are stellar.,positive
"One of the best movies ever made, story and acting both top notch",positive
"Two words, ultimate classic.",positive
wat a film i`ll make you an offer u cant refuse,positive
"Puta que barbaro, es la mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos, obviamente no es para gente ignorante porque la trama es complicada, pero uf, que barbaro, increible, no no, para verdaderos cinefilos",positive
possibly the greatest film ever,positive
"Obras de arte, sobretodo la 2.",positive
"Absolute classic u gotta love it, the king of all movies! If u havent seen 1-3 yet u gotta watch it!",positive
"I can't believe that I waited so long to see this classic! If you haven't seen this...you have to. Now I am on the hunt for II and III although it sounds like II is the best and III is a bit of a flop. Pacino, Duvall and Caan are amazing in this film....not to mention Brando of course. I want to add this tilogy to my collection.",positive
"A fucking classic. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. If you haven't seen this movie, then you haven't seen true film.",positive
The offer you couldn't refuse.,positive

Burde have 6 stjerne!,positive
oh yea. mafia films are class,positive
Let's just be clear here- number 1 and 2 are all that counts... 3 was for Hollywood (thus the reason it's sucky.)... the best way to watch em: SAGA!!! And 1 & 2 are two of the best films EVER!!!,positive
What can't you say? Other than a bad review of course.,positive
"One of the greatest, if not the greatest movie of all time. The horse head scene is priceless.",positive
Didn't live up to the expectations I have heard of it over the years.,negative

"All round good film, has to be viewed as a trilogy, although the 3rd one lets it down a bit.",positive
Not the best of the trilogy but the blueprint for any attempt at an epic to ever follow it regardless of genre.,positive
mmm just about the best ever legendery,positive
Classic. Nothing more to say...,positive
"Classic, this was the best one of all. Just a perfect mob movie.",positive
One of the greatest movies ever made. I think I have seen it more than 10 times and it is never boring. The sequel was even better!,positive

Greatest movie i hv ever seen,positive
"Got a love it, a powerful well told story with some amazing acting",positive
i wonder why al pacino didnt got any awards in this good movie,positive
"Plot : A coming of age story about a family operated mafia. Story : Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the Don of the corleone mafia family , times are changing - but he refuses to dip into the up and coming drug buisness : which starts big problems. He also has four sons - Micheal (Al Pacino) a war vetran who is only one of his brothers not in the family ""buisnesss"" - Sonny or Santino (James Caan) the son who would take the Don's position once he passed away - Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) adopted at an early age , he is the family's consilgere - and finally Fredo (John Cazale) who is seemingly half in and half out of the family buisness. As tensions rise with the Corleones refusal to help out another family with the drug dealing - people are killed and new oppurtunities are presented. This is one of the best character driven films of all time , it's characters and setting are thrown at you at incredible speeds : it took my a couple viewings to understand who all the characters were - but once I did , I saw the huge signifigance of the entire story. Visuals : Lots of amazing long shots and action scenes. Though not very out of the box - it's masterfull lighting and well designed settings will defintly keep it realistic. Sypnosis : This film didn't get it's reputation as the best out of nowhere. I doubt there's a person out there who won't enjoy this film.",positive
"Part I was awsome. Part II was excellent, but part III was very disappointing. I am sorry to say this but Pacino's performance in the role of Michael Corleone pales in comparison with Dugall's in part II.",positive
a Reality in these times,positive
"Classic. Incredible cast. So many have tried to capitalize on it's popularity, but to no go. I was really surprised at how much I liked this movie. Only downside is Marlon Brando's dreadful accent.",positive
lots of killing people.,positive
The book is miles ahead . Decent movie,negative
"I thought this was a very good movie. One of the best mafia movies ever! I especially like the fact that right before something bad happens, you see something that's orange. The plot for this movie and the others that follow can get complicated and I'm pretty sure that I would have been lost if I didn't have John sitting next to me explaining it.",positive
"Super marvellous, the series is my all-time fave.",positive
"Simply put, one of the best movies ever made. A true masterpiece in every aspect - script, direction, acting, cinematography.",positive
"Still the ""Godfather"" of mafia films. I can watch this one over and over and never get sick of it.",positive
"How to rate such a magnificent movie... One of the, if not the, greatests movies ever. Everything, the acting, the directing, the editing, the soundtrack... A total hit.",positive
"What can you say about this movie. It is spectacular! Not just a great mafia/gangster movie, but one the best movies ever made. I loved it.",positive
Very good movie about Mafias GREAT!!,positive
"How many people try to do Brando impersonations based on this movie. How many people quote ""Make him an offer he can't refuse"" - this, the next one, the last one - all very, very good.",positive
greatest film ever made,positive
Marlon Brando for ever,positive
"d GODFATHER of all mafia films, along with goodfellas",positive

A crime masterpiece.,positive
The best mafia film!,positive
Incomparable movie...everyone must watch it.,positive
"best movie of all time, hands down..",positive
"The ""Godfather"" of all mafia/action movies...its the quintessential movie to indoctrinate those of us who would like to get a glimpse into, but never actually venture into the big bad (almost exotic) underworld...!",positive
"Brando, Pacino, Duval, Caan, etc...what more can you ask for? I watch it repeatedly...I am a Native New Yorker so it does have a familiarity to it. Outstanding performances.",positive
One of the best films ever made!,positive
moi j'ai trouver ca long mais bon c'est bon pereil lol,positive
I love Brando but this was not as tight a movie as Godfather II. I think James Caan's acting was over the top.,positive
Loisto leffa kaikinpuolin.,positive
The greatest movie ever made,positive
Perfect in every was possible.,positive
"Mr. Corleone never asks a second favor once he's refused the first, understood? Still many many years after the first viewing this still is an excellent film. Truly. In so many ways.",positive
"Watching the Godfather felt like watching an asylum inmate weave a florid patchwork quilt. Moments of genius side-stiched with elements of over-eagerness and mis-steps. Despite that though, it is a really enjoyable movie. if you are into the ol' ultra-violence. Hmm. Maybe I shouldn't have read the book first.",negative
"the best move ever....... great, absulotly great. i have wached it over 70 times and stell i wana see it evry day",positive

La mejor pelicula de la historia del cine. Una oferta que no se puede rechazar.,positive
"Brando, Pacino were awesome. The story is awesome. And I'm a Deigo. It's impossible for me not to like this movie.",positive
An absolutely essential landmark in American Cinema.,positive
"Deservedly regarded as a cinematic masterpiece, this is a brilliant study in human weakness and brutality. Everything about it is outstanding, but what really stays with me is how convincingly Al Pacino portrays a sympathetic man's descent into ruthless, cynical plotting and cold-blooded murder. He has never surpassed this performance.",positive
Marlon Brando is a real Godfather... The Best film I have ever seen...,positive
Still the Gold Standard,positive
"Stunningly directed from a flawless screenplay this film, once seen, stays in the memory for ever. Pacino gives a masterclass in acting which he has never quite bettered.",positive
The definition of a great movie,positive

"moments of suspence and violence,superb acting and directing.....",positive
"why anyone wouldn't want to see this, I will never understand. The Best Movie of all Time.",positive
Why do they even bother offering to make this anything but five stars?,positive
"This movie is perfect. It does everything right and is the defining example of what movies should be. In fact, this movie is so perfect that it speaks for itself, so I'm cutting this short.",positive
Another classic movie,positive
"Sheer Genius, one film thats more fun than the book",positive

i love gangster movies! everyone has to see this movie at least once in their life,positive
The classical of the classics! Must be seen no matter you are a man or woman!,positive
I resisted the Godfather for so long. I tried at least 4 times to watch it before I made it the whole way through. This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. Better than Citizen Kane because of the action.,positive
"En av de filmene som en mÃ¥ se fÃ¸r du mister synet! Gidder ikke Ã¥ skrive mye om den, annet enn at den er god og at du burde se den om du ikke har sett den enda.",positive

This movie is the shit! I've always loved this sort of Mafia action and this movie is the best,positive
"I really admire this film, its tonality and reality, its italian mood",positive
Can't I give this six stars? Please?,positive
"Classical storytelling meets a new brand of filmmaking in Coppola's undisputed accomplishment, one of his many in the 1970s. The sheer audacity of the project took the world by storm, and a cast of old favorites and new talents met with a bang, providing a new breed of acting the film just couldn't do without. Particularly, James Caan and Marlon Brando turn in performances of masterful strength, but the whole cast- Pacino, Duvall, Cazale, etc.- do magnificently. Like all of the emerging ""movie brats"", Coppola injected his stories with a thick sense of nostalgia, a longing for the organized look of classical studio projects; but there is at the same time an unrestrained madness to his method which can be felt as well as seen, and which would only escalate throughout his oeuvre in this decade. This provides an unpredictability, a passion and a freedom, which audiences were immediately drawn to in 1972 and which continues to transfix them today- and it is this invisible force which makes this a singular vision.",positive
Simply one of the best films to be made from the 1970's.,positive
this is the best movie ever,positive
"Sometimes, things are massively popular for a reason, that reason being that they really are that good.",positive
"script, screenplay and acting makes this movie perfect. THE movie.",positive
The movie that codified the La Cosa Nostra Lifestyle in the United States. Simply a classic...,positive

I'm probably the only guy on the planet who doesn't like The Godfather.,negative
best movie ever. the whole trilogy is fantastic!,positive
The Godfather trilogy is just amazing!,positive
Fascinating mafia epic,positive
"This movie always makes me really hungry. I think it's less about the blood, and more about the rich, warm colors that Coppolla uses...helped by the fact that it's all on semi-hazy 70's era film stock - the moving equivalent of getting a matte finish on your photographs.",positive
There are no words to describe this film! Evergreen and Best Ever!,positive
Matched only by Part II,positive
What needs to be said?,positive
"I finally saw this a few days ago... very well-made movie! My expectations were very high, but I was still impressed... which means it must be good!",positive
As close to a perfect movie as you will ever see.,positive

":) If u haven't seen it before, then u don't deserve to watch it at all.",positive
"I'm gonna make you an offer, you can't refuse!",positive
"It defines,what you call ""the passion for cinema"".For the people belonging to this part of the world,it is a film school in itself!",positive
"Another member of my four-way tie. If you've seen it, you'll know why; no need to explain. Holy crap, it's good.",positive
possibly the greatest movie ever,positive
"complete powerhouse of a film-everything is perfect, acting, script, characters, score, photography etc. The concept, the quotes, the storyline sets the baseline for all future crime films, though never bettered",positive
"Es las mejor de la trilogia, la trama , los dialogos , el vestuario , la banda sonora , los actores , la historia , las matanzas , son fuera de serie de serio que me encanta!!!",positive

"The acting from the entire cast, the script, the photography, the score, the direction- it's all fan-damn-tastic!! No other film has ever portrayed dealings with one's family and crime as well as, ""The Godfather"".",positive
A Benchmark for rating other movies,positive
"After getting through the terribly long (30 minute) wedding scene at the beginning of this movie, I thought this was an awesome flick. 10 minutes would have been more than enough for that opening scene though.",positive
Best. Movie. Ever. Simple as that!,positive
Un film titanesque !!!Une fresque mythique avec la grande composition de Brando !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive

"This movie story line, still in some countries they are following. Considering the year the movie was taken. Stunning story.",positive
is like the book of mafia..,negative
"What an exceptional masterpiece. The story is flawless in its thoughtfully paced delivery. Francis Ford Coppola is a gift to this industry and performances by Pacino, Duvall and Brando are excellent.",positive
"Even though the film was released over 30 years ago it is still, one of if not the best Gangster films of all time. The casting was brilliant, Marlon Brando most notably played an absolute diamond in his portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. 5 star film!!",positive
Brandon verran parempi kuin kakkososa.,positive
The best mob movie. Well directed and acted. Not much to be said. This movie will always be in my all time top 10 list,positive
"""And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look RIDICULOUS!""",positive
completely lives up to the hype.,positive
"Masterpiece !! Don Corleone: We've known each other for many years but this is the first time you've ever come to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is Godmother to your only child. But, let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship and you were afraid to be in my debt.",positive
Great plot and great storyline,positive
Probably the best movie ever. Ever.,positive
A masterpiece... but everybody know that already.,positive
One of the best movies i have ever seen... One of my favorite movies of all time,positive
"A stone-faced look at life in the golden era of the American mob. With Marlon Brando, James Caan and Al Pacino bringing this story to life under the watchful eye of Francis Ford Coppola, it would have been hard for this film not to have become the classic it is today.",positive
La mejor obra cinematogrÃ¡fica de la historia por lejos. El paradigma escencial de la sociedad norteamericana y el universo invaluable de la familia como un todo social.,positive
"oooo, this is violent. the language is surprisingly sparse. i had to watch it twice to catch everything with all the sicilian names & so many characters. young al pacino is very good.",positive
"Classic. What else needs to be said? If you haven't seen it, you should.",positive
"""Leave the gun, take the cannolies!",positive
Well done movie. It's great.,positive
"The film started out slow for me, but I quickly became emotionally engaged. Wonderful, three-dimensional characters and a complex, yet still realistic storyline. Great performances by the always underappreciated Talia Shire, John Cazale and especially Al Pacino.",positive
AMAZING. BEST MOVIE EVER.,positive
it all the about the characters.. amazing.,negative
One of the Greatest Mafiosi movies Ever.,positive
Greatest of all time,positive

"BÃ¤sta filmen ever, felfri.",positive
Everything in life you need to know can be learned from The Godfather.,positive
MArio Puzzo Number One Hit. Take you in Journey of how to dixcover your MOB charecter that u wish to dig out of your soul.,positive
which is better- the book or the movie? usually such questions have only one answer: the book of course. but with coppola's adaptation of puzo's masterpiece there can be no easy answer...both the book and the film have sought rather blatantly to glamorize the mafiosi; neither offers any regret...but they do it with such unbridled panache- class even- that one can't help but fall in love with the Godfather...brando no doubt steals the show with his unique hanky-stuffed-in-mouth portrayal of don corleone...,positive
Legend - 'Sonny listen',positive
100% MAFIA---VERY GOOD,positive

"Simply put, this is the most complex, well-told, and entertaining film yet.",positive
What more can i say?! Marlon Brando's performance is simply momentous! Some may say Part II succeeded it but i absolutely disagree!,positive
"All time greatest, nothing comes anywhere close to this masterpiece...the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of Cinema",positive

"A good, sophisticated film that defined the gangster genre. Rather difficult to follow in places, so all attention MUST be paid.",positive
"An excellent gangster film, just not quite as good as Goodfellas.",positive
Aboslutly perfect...no wonder it got Best Picture in 1972...and Godfather Part II got it as well,positive
"probably the best trilogy ever created, THE GODFATHER is an epic tale that captures the reality of mafia life throughout a 40 year span. The Godfather trilogy is full of life lessons, ,trajedy, triumpth. It is a true American classic",positive

"Very, VERY good, but I really can't say it's the best movie of all time like so many people do. Some scenes were very well executed, and I loved seeing Diane Keaton when she wasn't 60. One thing I was impressed with is how little it has aged, like so many old films.",positive

Simply the greatest movie ever made. Iam Gonna make him and offer he cant refuse,positive
"the most overhyped movie of all time. Undoubtedly a great film, but - maybe it's just the genre itself and the glorification of guns and death that riles me. Beautifully shot and acted (a bit over the top perhaps but so many deaths and dying scenes for the Stanislavsky recruits to get stuck into. I love Pacino but prefer Scarface, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon to this. Also, there is no hook - what do i have in common with these people - family? don't think so... So there you go - you are all wrong about this film so stop banging on about it.",negative

"It has taken some time for me to finally fully appreciate this movie. I have been somewhat prejudiced against the movie because of its cult status and the fact that people laud it as the best movie ever, which it by no means is. However, The Godfather is and epic movie of honour, betrayal and family and everyone owes it to themselves to see it at least once in their lives for it truly is a masterpiece with all the superb acting and direction that follows such a lable.",positive
Excellent show by Coppola. Al Pacino was still a young guy in the film. A film with excellent actors like Marlon Brando and Al Pacino should never be missed.,positive
"Bonafied classic gangster pic. of the early 70's so clearly laid how the Mafia works that countless other directors have been borrowing from it for the past 35 years. Brando is the ultimate don (if anything, his perf. is equal to DeNiro's Vito fro G.F. 2). Pacino got a gret oppourtunity to strut his stuff in his break-thru, again with comparisons to Coppola's '74 sequel. And look at all the other standouts; Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Shire as the much- abused Connie, Cazale as a runt in a litter of lions, Vigoda as the brooding Tessio and who could forget the towering Lenny Montana as Luca Brassi (who unfortunately got to sleep with the fishes well before his time). You almost HAVE to wath G.F. 2 directly after this film to appreciate all both films have to offer. Never turn your back against this motion picture.",positive
"Definitely the best movie ever made in my humble opinion ... Everything is close to perfection : from the story to the acting ... The evolution of Michael Corleone from a young and promizing war hero to a ruthless Don is what makes this movie so incredible .. and who can forget the incredible and unforgettable Nino Rota's score. """,positive
how is this movie a classic? i can't stand even five minutes. color me uncultured.,negative
I can understand why this movie is a classic.,negative
Marlon Brando and Al Pacino wot else do you want and they ve with them Roberto De Nero,positive
Al-Pacino and Marlon Brando is one of my favorites actor...they are good...!!,positive
The greatest Gangster tale ever told. You forget they are murdering crooks as the story is about a family and their relationships. Best cast ever.,positive
"Story, Casting, Score, all is close to perfection",positive
It's Al Pacino's acting that lifts this film to a higher level. He is absolutely sensational in this film. Marlon Brando also does one hell of a job.,positive
"Don Vito Corleone: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive

"I know, I know. But I just can't sit through it.",negative
"I believe I saw this movie many years ago, but it was good to see it again with more adult eyes. So many scenes have made movie folklore. It is so cool to see some of the older actors as they were 40 years ago. The Godfather stands the test of time.",positive
Yeah. It's a classic & very good. I just can't feel the love...,negative
Excelentisima. Hay que tomar decisiones y actuar.,positive
"Classic, epic and thoroughly engrossing. I can't tell you anything that you want have heard a million times already",positive
This film is a masterpiece. It was the first film to have an anti-hero. Michael Corleone goes from American Hero to American Nightmare. The greatest script Shakespeare never wrote.,positive
Greatest movie all time. Considering it was made in 1972 when the likes of Beware! The Blob were also produced.,positive
"Amazing cinematograpy, great story, captivating characters...Maybe the greatest film ever...Part II is as good maybe bettter...",positive
la ams grandiosa de todos los tiempos,positive
"/sigh booring I lost count of the times I fell asleep during this so called ""masterpiece""",negative
Great portrayal of the gangster lifestyle during the height of the organized crime era. Unmistakable characters with catchy lingo makes it easy to understand why this flick is held in such high regard. The original gangster movie.,positive

One of the greatest films ever. Only paralleled by the second part.,positive

The Godfather of all gangster movies,positive
great calssic love this movie,positive
gut gut dah neh pelem,positive
Soz. It's actually rubbish. Look at Brando's face there. JUST LOOK AT IT. He needs the toilet! That doesn't make a good film. Now go back to your homes and have your tea. NOTHING TO SEE HERE.,negative

"again you? yes. why? i came to kill you,hahahhahaha...",positive
CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC. Brando is amazing.,positive
"Took me forever to get around to seeing it and the whole trilogy... like only in the last year. It was great though, if not quite as good as I thought it might be. Very glad to have seen it though!",positive
Its the Godfather. Need I say more?,positive
The quintessential Mob movie. Fuck Scarface.,positive
Francis Ford coppola unleashed on this series. Marlon Brando does an acceptional Job as well as Al pacino... GREAT MOVIE,positive
"Probably the best film ever make! Alur ceritanya bagus, bercerita mengenai mafia Itali di Amerika. Dan Marlon Brando memainkan Don Vito Coroleone dengan sempurna. Gak salah kalau dia diganjar Oscar untuk perannya itu.",positive
One of the greatest movies ever made. Shocking gang violence.,positive
i adore the Corleone(s)!,positive
the perfect movie with an aeesthetic that has held the test of time a movie that I can watch back to back and never tire (actually a holiday tradition for me and my mom to watch this movie every christmas),positive
The most handsome movie ever!,positive
Absolute classic! Never has there been a movie this good (besides part II) and there will never be another to match such greatness! I will always remember Marlon Brando as the Godfather and Al Pacino as one of the greatest actors of all generations.,positive
"One of my all time favorites. Absolutely a must see. Every actor in this movie is great, the whole thing is brilliant. SEE IT!!!! ""Drop the gun, take the canoli""",positive

Kylla klassikko katsomista kestaa.,positive
"Amazing, truly worth the wait and struggle to get a copy",positive
Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.,positive
Another good Gangster film but not the best,positive
"Absolutely outstanding! Sad at times, mostly dramatic and even a tiny bit of humor infused throughout has made this one of the best movies ever made.",positive
amazing best gangster film ever,positive
oh god ... here we go,negative
A flawless Masterpiece.,positive
Classique des classiques. Immanquable.,positive
Existe un antes y un despues en mi vida con esta pelicula. La cago,positive
"Probably the best movie ever made. Regardless of if you like the subject matter displayed, the way it is filmed and the work of the actors is beyond anything you've ever seen. It just moves so well that you're on the edge of your seat at every moment. Marlon Brando 101",positive
"If he believed in America, then I believe in America myself",positive
My second favourite film,positive
the best movie at all,positive
"The first time I watched it I fell asleep (for the first half an hour). The second time I watched it - I did not understand why I would ever fall asleep for this movie, and I watched it for the third and fourth..times, classic.",positive
Could a movie be any better? I think not.,positive
So amazingly over-rated,negative
Clearly the greatest movie ever!,positive
"One of those films that everyone loves. There's good reason too, absolute classic.",positive
This is an offer you can't refuse!!! WOW ! I love this movie i can watch it over an over. Actually i like the 3 parts almost equally.,positive
"Anyone who thinks THE GODFATHER is simply a ""gangster movie"" has completely missed the point. It is an epic about royalty, heritage, family, and power.",positive
"A brilliant take on the ganster movie, best for viewing when going to the mattresses...",positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
"Genius Masterwork. I don't know why I love this film so much ... in fact the mafia or any kind of big scale criminals are nothing you should enjoy watching ... still, an epic story about power and family .",positive
I dont think i deserve to review this movie..the best ever...i feel a Corleone myself now that i've seen the movie a million times,positive
This is and will always be by far one of the best Hollywood movies ever.,positive
"class book, classic movie",positive
"The first one and the best one. One of the best cast ever Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and John Cazale. Brando's ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""-line is already worth the money alone.",positive
"getting better everytime I watch it, can't get enough. The best movie ever.",positive
I know it's a classic. It's also a GUY thing.,negative
I'm speechless. the only thing that comes to my mind that it's LEGENDARY,positive
"how can you not love mafia movies i mean the cast is packed with top notch players like Brando and Pacino. plus it has the best lines in movie history...I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" or ""Take it to the matress"" or ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes"" just pure brilliant",positive
"Best. one word says it all ""BEST""",positive
Top 5 movies of all time.,positive
One of the best (If not the best) movies ever made,positive
best movie ever made,positive
Best of the trilogy.,positive
The Best Movie I've Ever Seen...The Baptism Scene Was Just BriLL!!,positive
"A brilliant film, with flawless acting and seamless direction. Best line? ""Leave the gun... take the cannoli"". Rent this and Part II and watch them right after the other. Then rent Part III and burn it outside without watching it because it is so heinously bad. I can watch I and II over and over again and find new nuances and things I didn't catch the first 3,000 times I saw them!",positive
Along with The Godfather the greatest movie ever made...!!! Al Pacino's transformation from the start of the first part to the end of the second is an acting miracle nd marlon brando makes and offer no one can refuse!,positive
great movie...an american classic,positive
La mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos.,positive
Min 70-talsklassiker!,positive
Phenomenal. The ambience of the film is amazing- I soaked into the world of Corleone family.,positive
"A fantastic movie and realist look into the mafia lifestyle that was prevalent in those days. Great acting performances all around in what has to be one of the most suspenseful and gripping movies of all time. The only complaint I can think of is that the women in the film were too ugly. Would it have killed the director to find a hotter woman to play al pacino's mom. Diane Keaton though, damn sexy! Second best movie ever, behind of course, SUPERBAD!",positive
one of the best movies ever,positive

You can't argue with this.,positive
"What can I say...one of the best maffia films ever. Scarface very good, Goodfellas, Casino...this one though has that style and ofcourse the soundtrack and atmosphere are at a lonely height",positive
"Yes, it's that good.",positive

I don't know...I just found it boring...,negative
"its the godfather, enough said",positive
"Dare I say...Too long.... I liked the first hour, but the two hours remaining... It was cool to see Al Pacino when he was young though. Storyline was cool but just too long for me!",negative
"Tajuton leffa! ""What have I done to deserve this disrespect?""",positive
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.,positive
Best movie ever made!,positive
"Engrossing Italian-American mafia epic does as much to tell the story of the American Dream as organized crime apologetics. Also, technically established a new lighting look that revolutionalized cinematography. It's called ""Top Soft.""",positive
"As someone who has read the book, I can't LOVE this movie, but it's not terrible either. Marlon Brando is my image of Vito Corleone, but Michael and Kay were just bad casts. Pacino, great, Keaton, great. But as the characters, no! GOD! I am the ONLY person to have read this book?",negative
"of course the greatest film about the mafia, mob, La Casa Nostra, whatever you want to call it. just soooo well writen, and acted out sooo well anyone who has not seen this movie should be whacked. this is without a doubt one of THE top movies since the first camera started rolling.",positive
"Am I missing something here? I mean, I liked it. Brilliant performances and all that but it was just a story to me and I didn't get that much from it. All it seemed to do was set up the other two movies. I don't really have a bad word to say about this film, but it didn't blow my mind...not even slightly.",negative
classic never die! the greatest 70's movies...,positive
godfather of all movies,positive
Best film of all times!,positive

"A classic, perhaps the greatest film ever made.",positive
"Join our GODFATHER group, visit my site and join",positive
A classic of American cinema. So many great actors. Brando is prue genius.,positive
Quite possibly the only perfect movie ever. A must watch for everyone in their formative years.,positive
"There is a reason that on top of most people's lists of all time best movies lies Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather combines perhaps the best acting performances from the prestigious careers of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with memorable supporting roles from James Caan and Robert Duvall. The artistic vision of this film is superb, capturing the 1940s Italian Mafia atmosphere to perfection, supported by a rich soundtrack. The evolution of Michael Corleone's character through this movie and the Godfather Part II is a cinematic masterpiece to behold, and Al Pacino captures the character perfectly, from the naive 'college kid' to the Mafia boss he becomes. The Godfather is not your run of the mill 'mafia film'. Themes of family and duty run strong through the trilogy, and even through Michael Corleone's fall from grace, you cannot help but empathize with his character. The Godfather is quite simply the best of all time. Peerless in every regard, an epic in every sense, and a classic to endure the ages.",positive
"this is one of those that you canÂ´t miss.if you havent seen any of the trilogy, i urge you to do it! itÂ´s unbelievable how you end up lovin the corleone family n understanding their ""business"".. they are just protecting their family! excellent cast.",positive
over long and overrated,negative

"I bought this without ever having seen it, and have never regretted that decision. This film is so good I can't believe how I missed it for so long.",positive
overrated pile of fermentum.,negative
Best movie ever made!!!,positive
"Great Acting, but very slow moving.",positive
awesome movie performences were really amazing,positive
Book and the movie + F.F.Coppola= OMFG!!!,positive
"This is my favorite movie. The older I get, the more it's story and family archetypes resonate with me. In many ways, it is the story of America told from the perspective of one family's rise and fall - The Corleones.",positive
Favourite part is the horse head!!!,positive
Marlon Brando is a GOD!!!,positive
The start to the greatest trilogy ever made.,positive
it was okay...too bad brando's character had to die.,negative
Pour moi le meilleur du genre,positive
the best. what more can i say,positive
"This movie defines the term good dialog. The entire cast gives an amazing performance, but James Caan is completely amazing. His portrayal of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone is simply awe inspireing. A definite must see.",positive

Marlon Brando er den ultimate gudfar. Ingen tvil.,positive
"Beautiful. The story runs with the conflict of Michael not wanting anything to do with the family business, and it being his duty to take up. Simply brilliant.",positive
"I think if I don't give this five stars, I get kicked off of Flixster, and the people at IMDb will burn my house down. Such an important movie, and the movie that set the trend for 70s greatness to come.",positive
"Great movie, but i don`t think it`s the best one ever!",positive
The Number one of Gangtser movies! A true genius Marlon Brando as Don Corleone and the excellent talents of a young and charismatic Al Pacino as Michael Corleone the best Godfather for me.,positive
A classic. Nuff said.,positive
"This is definitely my favorite movie of all time. The Godfather is truly an amazing movie, and if you haven't seen it, I absolutely urge you to see it, Buy it, rent it, kill someone for it. I don't care. Just watch it.",positive
the very best of all time,positive

Honte a celui qui n'a pas vu ce film (on pardonnera si pas vu les 2 autres),positive
"Perfectly written, film, acted, scored. This movie does not take a single misstep. Its perfect. It forever changed the way we view the Mafia and is a intensely sympathetic story of a group of people without a shred of common morality.",positive
I don't have enough space to even write exactly what I think of it. It's simply just a GOOD movie. Not the greatest ever.,negative

The greatest movie of all time,positive
Perfect in every way,positive
"Great film...some brilliant moments. Some of the best use of montages I've seen, as well as progression and character. With having said that, i cannot help but find a lot of inconsistancies and flaws within the film. Enough to make me realize that the film isn't the American Masterpiece it's coined to be. Unlike 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film suffers from the director I believe. Coppolla has never completely won me over as a director (other than Apocalypse Now), and the film's character behaviors do not entirely ring true and believable to me. The transformation with Al Pacino's character is many a times flat and unconvincing. If you want to say he got over his Italian wife's death and just suddenly jumped over to US an married is ex-gf, then let's get a little of that, because that jump is just flat out rude to the character. The film did keep me glued for almost its entire duration, with a consistent sense of emotion...Im excited to finish the trilogy, and everyone owes themselves a chance to see a milestone filme. The Godfather picture is def. my favorite mob/crime/gangster film out there, next to Once Upon A Time In America & Goodfellas, even though that particular genre isn't my cup of tea. 8/10",positive
"Great acting, riveting story, intense drama. You have to see this and the Godfather II to appreciate the Corleoni family saga.",positive
My Bible. Two and three also. I don't watch it unless I take the whole day to watch all three. Did u know Robert Deniro was going to play the Don in the first one?????,positive

Actors actors and actors.,positive
"The greatest gangster film of all time, number 2 is probably better to be honest. All men should watch and then follow the code of the Godfarther, i live by some of the wisdoms in these films. Francis Ford Coppolla is a legend, Pacino, De Niro, Duvall, Brando, Caan, Talia Shire, Jesus, you just cant get a better cast. Heavenly!!!",positive

"A true classic. This movie has it all from the cast, to the story, to the action. It does not get any better than this.",positive
Best film of all time. Absolutely amazing. great story and actors.,positive
The greatest mafia film...enough said!,positive
"There's not a whole lot I can add to praise what is often considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time. Every time great acting is brought up, The Godfather is brought up. Every time great screenplays are brought up, The Godfather is brought up. Every time great music is brought up, The Godfather is brought up. And The Godfather deserves every bit of the praise it gets. There's just not a whole lot I can add to this. What I will talk about is my experience with this movie. Upon my first viewing, I loved The Godfather, but I found a flaw: a lot of the characters were hard to keep up with. The plot, at times, was a little confusing. Even so, not long after my first viewing of this masterpiece, I longed to watch it again. And when I did see it again, a wave of new understanding hit me. Details I hadn't noticed before suddenly stuck out at me like a sore thumb. I loved the film. And every time I revisit The Godfather, there's more that I understand and more that makes me go ""Oh yeah! Wow!"" Quite simply, this is one movie that genuinely gets better with each viewing. And I love watching it over and over again. That's what makes this movie so fantastic. And with multiple viewings, all of the flaws fade away and I am left staring at film perfection. That's my experience with this masterpiece. A film that ages magnificently, The Godfather will always remain as the pinnacle of movie greatness. 10/10",positive
The best movie dealing about the Italian mafia. Marlon Brando makes a historical performance.,positive
"Considered to be one of the greatest american films ever made. Brando and Pacino are gold. ""It's Gold Jerry! GOLD!""",positive
"If you are a guy and you haven't seen this, you should: 1. Not admit that 2. Watch it!",positive
A very special film for me. Reminds me of my summer holiday when my cousins and I played Italian mafia after watching the movie hundred times.,positive
A must-watch! An absolute classic by Coppola. Highly recommended.,positive
"If you ever want to start understanding a man, you HAVE to watch this, plus, YOU will end loving it as well.",positive
"i mean , i'm type of crazy abt this movie and of course the book.",positive
"The perfect theme song, the perfect actors (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, even Robert Duvall), perfect story, perfect movie. This movie makes La Cosa Nostra look like a party, and i want to be invited.",positive

"Malo mi je nerodno, ker sem ga gledala sele letos, ampak je res ful dober.",positive
I grow up with this film! and I love it!,positive
"The only man who can out act a young Marlon Brando is an older one! 2nd Best theme song of all time. The 1st being Star wars of course. ""But I always thought that when it was your time that you would be the one to hold the strings. Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone. Something."" - F%&*@#$ brilliant!",positive
My absolute favorite movie of all time! I can't say enough...,positive

A Movie Masterpiece!!,positive
"It took me hours to get past the first ten minutes but luckily the rest made up for that. It was good, but I don't see it as the greatest American film",positive
one of the best films ever made,positive
"The Godfather is a timeless classic that transends cinematic history. It was however (in my opinon) too long. On a side note, Marlon Brando is a pussy and a hypocrite for not accepting his Oscar (because, as he said, Native Americans were mistreated/misrepresented in Hollywood) when he was often quoted for his stereotyping of Jews.",positive
The textbook definition of a classic.,positive
"Take a national bestselling crime thriller. Trim the unnecessary subplots for pacing. Add copious amounts of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and Robert Duvall, all under the directorial auspices of Francis Ford Coppola. If what comes out isn't one of the closest things to perfection the film industry has ever seen, I hereby renounce my life as a cinemaphile.",positive

Set the bar for Gangster movies that is yet to be reached.,positive
"tanto la 1, como la 2 y la 3 son exelentes. Nada mas por decir",positive
Possibly the best movie ever made. I really can't say anything more than that. It's approaching perfection,positive

"O.K. look i know you've probablly heard so many time ""the greatest movie ever is the godfather"" it gets tiring and boring hearing it over and over again.

"Huh paljon parempi kuin muistinkaan. Lapsena jÃ¤i mieleen vain yksittÃ¤iset hienot kohtaukset ja murhat yms mutta nyt kuin katsoin niin elokuva on tÃ¤ynnÃ¤ moniulotteisia asioita ja teemoja. Sellaisia juttuja mitÃ¤ ei vÃ¤lttÃ¤mÃ¤ttÃ¤ osaa arvostaa ensimmÃ¤isellÃ¤ katselukerralla. En ihmettele yhtÃ¤Ã¤n miksi tÃ¤mÃ¤ on IMDB:n listan ykkÃ¶nen. Tietenkin on naurettavaa sanoa, ettÃ¤ joku tietty elokuva olisi kaikkien aikojen paras, mutta jos jonkun elokuvan pitÃ¤Ã¤ olla ykkÃ¶nen, niin olkoon se vaikka sitten ensimmÃ¤inen KummisetÃ¤. Kertakaikkisen hieno elokuva ja omassa genressÃ¤Ã¤n selkeÃ¤ ykkÃ¶nen kautta elokuvahistorian.",positive

A great movie that follows the ups and downs of the Corleone family. A classic indeed!,positive
One word - Masterpiece!,positive
You have no idea how i love this one. Its a masterpiece,positive
This is what family is all about as far as I'm concerned. Check it out.,positive
perfectly written. pefectly directed. perfectly acted. perfectly scored. perfectly influential.,positive
One of the best movies of all time. it should totally come before Citizen Kane on AFI's greatest movie list.,positive
One of the best movies ever! has everything!,positive
hay ofertas que no se pueden rechazar algunos moriremos de viejos ? no se ustedes,positive
"A cornerstone of cinematic progress. The acting is good while never over the top. The story is fascinating and brilliant but a bit hard to follow. The brutal methods of the Mafia will leave you cringing and waiting to see their next vile plot. The only small gripes I have about this movie are the length (even though it almost never stops entertaining, three hours is just a really long time), the fact that it does drag on a little bit for a few short moments in the middle and end, and the complexity of the story that left me having to look a few things up even after trying to pay close attention. These complaints are nothing compared to all the pluses in this movie. A must-see.",positive
One of the most popular and greatest movies of all time!,positive
who doesn't give this 5 stars?,positive
The best damn movie ever,positive
MASTERPIECE! Bravo!,positive
"arguably the greatest film of all time. For a reason. It is so good, as a film lover, it is actually intoxicating. Gritty, shocking - even now.",positive
Best movie ever made period.,positive
"be-e-a-eutiful movie, & all of it's sequels. not overrated as some have said (jerks...wouldn't know good acting if it bit them in the a$$), a true mafia classic",positive
"The Godfather is a movie that I can watch it on an on, and every time I learn something from that.",positive
"""Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter... """,positive
"Theses are the best movies in the world, they of course made number one out of the 100 best movies of all time. They are a masterpiece to say the least, and I would advise everyone to watch them!",positive
A perfect movie. My favorite.,positive
Along with the original scarface the best gangster movie ever. What sets this apart for me however is the depiction of the characters and the relationships in the family - makes me want to root for them! Not to mention the brilliant score...,positive
the best film in the world the story fantastik,positive
The best trilogy ever!!! its like the bible for men hahaha,positive
One of the best movies with one of the best casts of all time. There is so much to talk about this movie. A movie like this does not come around to often and its a must see.,positive
"Pretty solid film (as some have noted in the past). Well acted and well written. Revolutionary in its portrayal of mobsters and the Mafia. Has had obviously an enormous impact on culture since its release. I enjoyed the characterization of Michael Corleone, to me that is what makes the movie worth watching. Brando was spectacular as the Godfather, maybe my biggest complaint would be that there just was not enough of him. He seemed to be more of a supporting actor than a lead. Definitely in an elite class of films that come to mind instantly when you think the word ""classics.""",positive
"Simply a Masterpiece !! Marlon Brando is spectacular, and Al Pacino is amazing !! The music is wonderfully full of emotions !!",positive
"One of the great stories of all time in movies - the king and his sons. The acting is nuanced and affecting, the story captivating, the violence still eerily scary 3 decades ago. Coppola directs with inspiration right down to the music at the wedding party. Bears repeated viewings.",positive
the best movie i ever watched,positive
ErittÃ¤in karismaattinen nÃ¤yttelijÃ¤kaarti kantaa leffan massiivista juonta ansiokkaasti eteenpÃ¤in. MyÃ¶s ohjaaja osaa asiansa. KuvakielellÃ¤ saatetaan korostaa tiettyjÃ¤ asioita tai harkitusti johtaa katsojaa harhaan. JÃ¤nnitys tiivistyy loppua kohden ja jÃ¤ttÃ¤Ã¤ paljon tilaa jatko-osille. Mafialeffojen kliseet selkeÃ¤sti lÃ¤htivÃ¤t tÃ¤stÃ¤ leffasta mutta tÃ¤mÃ¤ tuskin haittanee ketÃ¤Ã¤n.,positive
favoritist in the worlddddd!,positive
"Yes, at times it runs a bit slow, but this is the greatest mob movie ever, and all of the acting is top notch.",positive
Perfect movie. I can watch it again and again and again and..,positive
Greatest cast assembeled in a movie. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give iconic performances. The rare occassion when the movie surpasses the novel that its based on.,positive
The greatest movie of all-time.,positive
"One of the Greatest Movies ever. If you don't get it, you don't get to watch movies any more.",positive
perfect Al Pacino... I love that movie but every time I see Marlon Brando speeking he looks like a bulldog :/.,positive
Det er jo bare en af verdens bedste film - se den med det samme,positive
It's Godfather FFsake!,positive
Best Movie EVER CREATED,positive

Marlon Brando is an incredible actor. My conclusion : The perfect movie.,positive
"The perfect movie. Get's everything right. A must see. Has become one of the benchmarks of filmmaking, creating a world of violence and crime that before had never been seen on film.One of the greatest films of all time. Performances are unrivaled. The movie is beautifuly shot and scripted. So many memorable scenes and a well paced story.",positive

The Original Gangsta Flick..ANother must have in the DVD Collection,positive
A classic and a must-see.,positive
A great classic to watch.,positive
"Marlon Brando was the best actor. The Godfather is a movie that I can watch it on an on, and every time I like it more. I read the book, (Mario Puzzo), I couldn't put it down, I thought the film might not be as good as the book, but you know what? Bingo the Film IT'S GOOD....",positive
Is there even anything to say about this movie? I think it speaks for itself,positive
"ah brando wonderful movie , pacino and duval potray an epic saga of mafiadom...Coppola masterpiece a must watch",positive
"A complete movie, incredible cast, screenplay and direction! I can watch this any number of times!!!",positive

You must love Al Pacino after you watched it....,positive
AMAZING IN EVERY WAY,positive
Just watching it and seeing how young all the actors look is great! I sat down and watched all three with my father a couple summers ago and we loved em all!,positive
wow!c'est la mafia qui inspire le film ou le film qui inspire la mafia?,positive
"I'm Italian. What can I say, I live to love this movie.",positive
"Brando is probably on the top of his method-acting, this word is probably used since he first appeared on the scene. Pacino and de Niro seem to be little kids in BrandoÂ´s shade. This story and the ambience can catch you for a lifetime.",positive
"The perfect movie. Get's everything right. A must see. Has become one of the benchmarks of filmmaking, creating a world of violence and crime that before had never been seen on film. A monster success and the Best Picture of 1972, if you see one film in your entire life, make sure it's this one.",positive

This is the Best movie ever made in the History of hollywood. There is no other movie which can be compared to it.,positive
"Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, they are the man",positive
"Michael: My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Kay Adams: Do you know how naive you sound, Michael? Presidents and senators don't have men killed. Michael: Oh. Who's being naive, Kay?",positive
"I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather.This is my number one,saw it a hundred times and will see it a hundred times more...",positive
"This perfect film not only boasts on all elements of cinematic principles, but the very presence of power carried by Vito Corelone (Marlon Brando) is extremely attractive at a very fundamental human level. This film is the very epitome of cinema.",positive
Absolutely fantastic! Amazing cast.,positive
Everyone should see this movie - twice!,positive
there really long but Godfather is cool,positive
what an way of life...dialogue...style..Tribute to Coppola..for the trilogy,positive

"One of the best movies ever made. You must see it at some point. Amazing actors, amazing plot, and the best movie of the 70's in my opinion.",positive
"No one in Hollywood wanted to make this movie. No one wanted Al Pacino to play Michael Corleone. Francis Ford Coppola put his soul into this film and made ""The"" classic!",positive
Best movie in american history!!,positive
Best film of all time in my opinion,positive
Well-crafted from the very beginning to the last word said in the movie.,positive
"I hate violent films but this is a genuine masterpiece, a perfect story told with a perfect cast acting at the top of their talents. Pacino is superb and Brando gives an incredible performance - the scene where he gazes on his dead son's body is so moving.",positive
Absolutely brilliant epic! Its quite slow in its storytelling but it never gets boring! id like to rate the whole trilogy as one though,positive
"Truly a great movie, I love the cinematograohy, and I do like how things happen slowly, but I feel that it fell into the same pacing trap that I hate about Brokeback Mountain which is that things happen slowly but that the movie still covers an enormous amount of time. Definitely a must see movie for anyone that considers themself a movie buff. Also not only are Pacino and Brando fantastic, but I feel that James Caan's role was the role that established his career as an awesome guy, even as it typecast him.",positive
Great movie!! Must see classic!!Liked all actors performances. Al Pacino was amazing in this movie!,positive
This movie and the ones following it are amazing!,positive

"C'est l'adaptation du roman de Puzzo. Plus qu'un film sur les gangsters, ce film est beaucoup plus profond et narre les relations complexes de la famille d'Italie du sud qu'elle soit sicilienne ou napolitaine Ã  travers l'exile vers un autre pays pour echapper a la misere insupportable et la poids de la mafia. Un chef d'oeuvre",negative

Ã  revoir encore et toujours,positive
"The Godfather is a such powerful film on so many levels. It's full of themes that appeal to everyone. Family, Love, Betrayal, the pursuit of money and power and the ""American Dream."" Not to mention superb performances by the leads, an incredible script and Coppola's best direction of his career. This one deserves six stars.",positive
"This is honestly just so excellent in every conceivable way. I'm almost convinced Francis Ford Coppola invented the crime epic. Here he takes the story of the mafia and transforms it into a story of pure honor and glory with characters that are relentlessly flawed and equally as sympathetic. Al Pacino really is the glue and the center of the catharsis that holds this movie together, but having Marlon Brando as Don Corleone just enhances the power and sophistication of the film tenfold.",positive
Love this movie... not the best in the trilogy though,positive
Seen it...can't get into it,negative
"""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse."" A movie kind of hard to not like.",positive

Ask my friend Bill Reilly . . .,positive

"""Marlon Brando at his best, powerful and moving, brings us through darkness and light."" I might as well update this review having re-watched this movie this past week. What I said before is true but this is also a testament to Coppola's attention to detail in his scripting and direction. He is a master of juxtaposition here. A wedding mixed with a request for murder, a baptism against multiple killings. Coppola brings to the screen the contradictory lives of mobsters, businessmen who have a honor and a loyalty that is worth dying for and killing for. One side is Vito Corleone, the Godfather, a man from the old order and way of life. The other side is Michael, the man who wants nothing to do with the family business but as everything he holds dear is attacked he slowly descends down into the world he defied at first. A winning cast, score, and brilliantly shot, this is the crime film.",positive
"QUE SE PUEDE DECIR??..UN CLASICO....LA MEJOR PELICULA DE LA MAFIA NORTEAMERICANA QUE SE HA HECHO, SIGUE PASANDO EL TIEMPO Y NINGUNA SE LE PUEDE IGUALAR....LOS CORLEONE SON Y SEGUIRAN SIENDO LA NETA...DIGO Â¿QUIEN NO LOS CONOCE?",positive
Corleone just rules the world.. LOVE IT..,positive
No mobster epic -- not even 7 years of The Sopranos -- can match this. I could watch this movie everyday for the rest of my life.,positive
Mi casa es tu casa..tres tres bon film,positive
"""The best movie ever!!!!""",positive
the ultimate epic about power and family - every shot perfection,positive
"This film is very good, but I'm not ready to call it one of the best films of all time. Maybe this is because I watched it many years after it was made, maybe it's because it's been hyped by many, or maybe it's because it can't truly be appreciated by someome in our time. With that being said, it IS very good movie. Coppola uses some very interesting choices to tell his well-woven story full of deep, engrossing characters. It's obvious that Coppola had the ""big picture"" in mind when making this film as it says so much about life as a whole and furthermore creates an opening for the next movie. Brando and Pacino are great in their roles with a strong supporting cast to fledge out the film. The one person I didn't care for was Diane Keaton. I've never been a fan of her, and this film didn't help. She was too flat for me, and I would have liked to see a stronger actor play her role. The Godfather is a brilliantly told story of the New York Mafia and everything that they represent. It's easy to draw from these characters and situations to relate to our own lifes and choices... just on a smaller scale.",positive
A really really good movie!,positive
best gangster movie made! Marlon Brando is top notch and ofcourse Al Pacino 1 of my fav. actors,positive
"Elokuva, josta ei vain voi kieltaytya. New Yorkin mafia vaikutti aikoinaan suuresti elokuvan esittamaan kuvaan Mafiasta. Kun kasis ei miellyttanyt, menivat studioporukat lakkoon. Kasis korjattiin ja johan alkoi leffanteko sujua...",positive
"THE Masterpiece. The greatest film ever, nothing to add.",positive
Wannabe a mafia? I suggest you to watch this first before committing such acts. This classic documentation is an ace and a must watch for everyone who are into a gang + crime + adrenaline rush movie. Kudos to Mario Puzo for the amazing storyline and Francis Ford Coppola for being such a creative director!,positive
You cant beat the original gangster movie,positive
Francis Ford Coppola était sur le point de faire faillite avant de faire le parrain. Ce film le remettra sur les rails. Une pléthore d'acteurs. Une histoire fascinante. Le parrain est devenu un film culte.,positive

best movie ever(apart from the sequels),positive
"Tremendous flick. Saw it again recently and it is just so captivating and engrossing. Everyone of the performances is close to faultless and the balance of characters is perfect. James Caan as the hot tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the moral and trustworthy Michael, Brando as the Don etc. I don't think it is the greatest film of all time but it certainly is close. However that is irrelevant. The only fault I can really say about this film is that it is quite different to the book making it a little inaccurate, but hey, who cares really? Additionally, the best bit of the film is not where they are all executed at the end, the best bit is where Michael makes his first kill as the train goes by in the restaurant. Pachino and his iconic eyes. Awesome!",positive
this movie will always be the best the story of this movie is great i love it,positive

"The best mob movie ever made. More memorable lines than a Mel Brooks flick. Even though the characters are evil you can't help but admire these people. That's why the film is so good, it makes you view the mob scene from their point of view instead of your own. If a movie can make even Diane Keaton look good it's got to be one worth seeing.",positive

"The foundation of all mob stories I suppose. Deep well constructed, multi-layered movie. Interesting even now - must have been mind-blowing when it first came out. Still very good today considering all the other mob-movies that exist",negative
"Bravo Brando! What can be said of Marlon's comeback breakthrough performance as the puffy faced Don Corleone (an effect achieved with moth balls in his mouth). The winner of best picture and best actor for Brando. Sammy the bull saw this film upon its release in theaters and was stunned, he said simply-thats the life. Francis Ford Coppola had to fight the studio head to allow a young al Pacino to play the role of Michael, shoot on location in new york and to also make it a period picture. You have to admire the cunning and brilliance of Michael and the masterful score by long time Fellini film composer Nino Rota (Coppola's wife also helped compose on the film). I could continue but i'll end my review with a interesting story..the author of the book Mario Puzo once attended a dinner party and the host insisted he meet ol' blue eyes(Frank Sinatra). Puzo tried to resist but when the two were introduced Sinatra became furious and he called Puzo many bad things. Although he never cursed the worst thing he called him was a pimp and refused to greet Mario Puzo due to the fact that there was belief the johnny Fontane character was based on Sinatra himself.",positive

La mejor pelicula que hay,positive
How can you not love this film?,positive
Very good but over rated.,negative
A Movie i can't refuse.,positive
Easily one of the best movies ever made,positive
It began my love of the crime drama genre and is still near the top of the list for the genre,positive
"Minus .25 stars for the times when Marlon takes things a little too far. Minus .25 stars for leaving out women and victims of mob crimes (and by extension, how the film glamorizes its subject matter). Fucking awesome movie in every other way. Yes, a masterpiece, I'd say. Need to see Godfather II now.",positive
i'll just never get tired of watching these - that's what i love about moveis with lots of layers - i always find something new,positive
Riktigt bra hade antagligen varit Ã¤nnu bÃ¤ttre om inte Sergio Leone hade tackat nej till att regissera den,positive
"I'll give him an offer he can't refuse! Uhh, it makes everybody shit their pants!",positive
Go to the matresses.........,positive
Episk film. Faktisk er alle 3 film super. Dog er de 2 fÃ¸rste lige en klasse over 3eren.,positive
I believe in America. Justifiably lauded.,positive
"This movie needs no explanation as to why I gave it a perfect five star rating. If you have not seen this movie, crawl out from underneath the rock you have been living in, drive to your nearest Blockbuster and watch it.",positive
"Kubrick himself stated that this was the finest film ever made, in his opinion. I'm hard pressed to disagree.",positive
Simply the greatest ever film,positive
Absolutely the BEST movie ever.,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
LO mas !!!!!! imperdibleeeeeeeee,positive
"Without doubt, the greatest film ever made!!!",positive

La obra maestra de Francis Coppola. Una trilogia respecto a una familia de italianos mafiosa en EE.UU. Tiene todos los elementos.,positive
Just look @ da cast...,positive
What can you say about this movie that hasn't been said a million times already. Al Pacino's (Michael) has one of the greatest character arcs ever in film.,positive
top 10 movie of all time,positive
Chef d'oeuvre intemporel.,positive
"The greatest movie of all time. A timeless story, brilliant acting... brilliant all around. This film should be required watching in high school justl like Shakespear is required reading.",positive
its ok. i will watch the others out of curiosity. its ironic how he dies via chocking. you would expect a gun to the face or somethign in that region.,negative
"Just lay back, watch and enjoy. I could easily spend a whole day watch all three...consecutive.",positive
"No la entendi muy bien, quizas por eso no me gusto tanto...Tengo que volver a verla",negative
The legendary existence of the trilogy speaks for itself. One of all time's best. I watched the trilogy back to back and was not bored of the 7 or 8 marathon hours.,positive
It is the best film ever. It has all what a perfect film needs...each and everything. Marlon Brando as the Godfather...you can never ever forget him after watching this movie......this movie continues to rule on every film lover's heart. Hats off to Francis Ford Coppola!!,positive

authentic. Impressive for 70s,positive
It's the perfect movie!,positive
"Great to see the re-issue of this. The sound and subtitles are certainly much improved, but there doesn't seem to be much new material and the few segments including poor footage (like the plane landing in LA) are still there and unchanged. Still a fantastic movie, though - I'm looking forward to the re-issue of part II.",positive
"l'ascension de micheal, le tout premier de la sÃ©rie, mon plus meilleur Ã  moi",positive
Classic by Francis Ford Copolla. Watch all three parts! Great MArlon Brandon in the first!,positive

muhteÅem Ã¶tesi bir film..izleyenlerin asla akÄ±llarÄ±ndan Ã§Ä±kmayacak karelere sahip.. her Åeyiyle dÃ¶rt dÃ¶rtlÃ¼k..,positive
"The best mob film ever and the 2nd film is just as good, some say it's better. Not keen on the third film though.",positive
"I think this is the best of the Godfather films, closest to the book (which I love)",positive
"For people who want a more in depth guide of the Mafia. In comparison to other fast paced movies such as Goodfellas and Casino, The Godfather goes in detail.",positive
aaa un gros classique,positive
it's my favourite one!,positive
"Wow, I saw this again after a while. It is utterly amazing. The tranformation of al pacino... damn!",positive
A classic. 'Nuff said.,positive
le meilleur film ever!!!,positive
It really deserves more than just 5 stars but this movie is KICK ASS!!,positive
When you watch the entire trilogy...you can appreciate the work a lot more since you see everything that this world does to Michael Corleone.....but if you just watch part 1...it's alright but f'n long and some dead parts in the movie.,negative
BÃ¤ttre Ã¤n sÃ¥ hÃ¤r blir inte en film.,positive
Le meilleur film jamais realise sur la mafia. un des meilleurs casting italien jamais fait encore. Merci Francis Ford Coppola !,positive
"Mi pelÃ­cula favorita!!! la primera vez k la vi kede impresionada y hasta ahor alo sigo, la mejor pelÃ­cula de ganster que haya visto!!!!",positive
"Arguably the greatest movie of all time. Brilliant story, characters & cinematography. A film that must be respected for what it has done for the industry.",positive
"Preferred the second movie to the first. But huge, sweeping films and Pacino shines for me more than Brando. Duvall is awesome as is James Caan.",negative
This is what a perfect movie should be like. It's got everything. This is one movie nobody can refuse...,positive
"En film der har absolut alt. og sÃ¥ er alle skuespiller pisse gode i den film! Don Corleone: ""Good. Someday, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But, until that day, accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day""",positive
One of the greatest movies ever,positive
Best movie of all time....no contest,positive
The second best movie ever made. Equal to its sequal!,positive
Greatest movie of all time.,positive
"graet movie,best of the best",positive
Maybe if my joke's good enough those sexy Italians will come to my doorstep.,positive
"Marlon Brando is amazing, as always, but in my opopnion this movie is seriously over rated. I can see how its in the top 100 films of all time but the top 5? I'm sorry but I couldnt relate to much in it",negative
I love this movie. al pacino is great. so is marlon brando but he's kind of freaky,positive
Increible. Una de las mejores peliculas de todos los tiempos.,positive
como barndo solo brando,positive
One of the best movies ever made.,positive
"A true Mafia movie that all others are measured against. Marlo Brando in his greatest role ever with a an up and coming actor at the time in Al Pacino not to mention the hot headed Sonny aka James Caan. I can still watch this today after 12 or more times and still love it as I did the first time. A movie of truth and fiction, which is which ? John Fontaine = Frank Sinatra ???",positive
La Mejor Pelicula de todos los tiempos,positive
The only movie anyone ever needs to see....,positive
Mucha.. pelicula.....,positive
another great Pacino movie,positive
"Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Marlon Brando, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall...what more do you want?",positive
Juste pour la prestation de Marlon Brando... vraiment excellent!,positive
I never miss it when it is on!,positive
"it's kinda hard to fallow, but it keeps you interested",negative
Best business movie!!!,positive
"I'm a man, hence, this is the best movie ever made.",positive
Timeless. Classic Love Michael Corleone.,positive
The gangster film the beats all the rest,positive
"Allright. You go to the restaraunt, you eat, talk for awhile and relax you get them relaxed. You get up, go take a leak....no better you ask for permission to take a leak. When you come back, come out blastin'. Dont take chances. Two shots in the head apiece...don't forget. Two shots in apiece in the head. then let the gun slide out of your hand and walk out fast. dont run just walk out fast",positive
"one of my favorite movies of all time, nothing beats the godfather",positive
Just perfect! wedding scene - sicily countrysite - family diners & gun fights are shot with te same accuracy . A proposition you cannot refuse...,positive
Quite possibly the greatest thing Al Pacino and Marlon Brando have ever done.,positive
This is definately a classic. Al Pacino really plays the part of Michael well. This movie portrays Italian Mafia very well. An all-time favourite in my book.,positive
"Yes, I'm strange for liking the Godfather, but it's a good movie, violence aside. Although it does glamourize gang violence, its got a good plot, interesting characters and is based on the real 'five families' of NYC.",positive
Classic all time movie,positive
One of the best movies ever! Marlon Brando's acting is just glorious!,positive
"James Caan steals show for me, but the best line: ""Luca Brazi sleeps with the fishes!"" get in!",positive
"cannot fault this movie - superb acting, beautiful score and geniusadaptation of the novel! a must see.",positive
"best movie in modern history,",positive
"from the opening wedding sequence to the baptism at the end, this is a movie that is almost flawless. It is invidious to single out any performancebut Pacino has never surpassed this in a career which has been filled with many fine performances. But most praise must go to Coppola who,in his early career showed true cinematic genius. Nothing since apocalypse now has, regrettably, lived up to the promise",positive
"great, enjoyable, cool all 3 parts. the music, story and speeches are the best i've ever see",positive
The greatest movie of all time,positive
second one was better but i love these movies!!!!!!!,positive
Bu gÃ¼ne yapÄ±lmÄ±Å bir baÅ yapÄ±t kesinlikle seyretmeyen kalmamalÄ±.,positive
I believe in America.,positive
Best film ever made A classic,positive
"The original, great book, great movies, great director. This is a true film classic.",positive
classic gangster film,positive
this film is amazing. it is a hands-down classic and i could watch it over and over and over again.,positive
Unreal performances by so many actors and great directing. A very prestigious movie.,positive
"extremely vile dysfunctional family, and i will happily never see this again.",negative
One of the greatest films of all time and true to the book. a great tale of family loyalties and revenge.,positive
Den fÃ¸rste og derved den bedste,positive
"One of the greatest movies ever made, based on a true story, best mob movie you can watch",positive
"not particularly my style of movie, but it is very good - wonderful acting and directing!",positive
"The most manly movie ever, it's like a way of life for man!",positive
One of those films you really wish you could hate because it's so worshiped by pretentious types. Unfortunately it's every bit as good as its reputation suggests. Fab.,positive
they don't make movies like this anymore.,positive
The best of the trilogy. Marlon Brando and James Caan are just fantastic. One of the best films ever made - unmissable!!!,positive
wtch again again again.... you can dicover more different things...,positive
michael corleone is the hottest thing to hit this earth. yeah baby it actually did justice to the book. and the way the don dies is cool.,positive
i'm gonna make him an offer he cannot refuse... bacci padrino,positive
Definitely the best of the three,positive
"Just epic, haven't seen the others yet but this was long and great all the way",positive
"A true film classic unmatched even by today's standards. It stands the test of time as one of the best Gangster Movies ever filmed. Brando, Pacino, Caan and Duvall deliver their best roles. Coppola and Puzo bring the novel to life! And who can forget the theme music?! Fact: The scene with Sonny (James Caan) getting shot up by machine guns cost over $100 000 to film in 1972. The car had explosive charges planted in it that fired from the inside out. Caan was scared to death about filming the sequence as he was rigged up with small explosives and fake blood packs. There was only one take to get it right no computer generated effects like today!",positive
Best film ever people who say its bad realy need to go for rehab,positive
The greatest film ever made simple as that! great production values fantastic screenplay supreme acting.The movie is more then just a run of the mill gangster flick. Some of the greatest ever actors star in this great production. messers Pacino and Brando. must see!,positive
Perhaps the greatest movie ever?,positive
Definition of classic,positive
The very essence of cinematic integrity accented by the lead actor not neeeding to be told how good he is!,positive
a man is not a man if he hasnt watched this movie. the best movie ever.,positive
Al Pacino le dio al personaje de Michael Corleone todo lo que necesitaba!! La mejor pelicula de la historia del cine!!!! :),positive
"If you have not, SEE IT!",positive
There's nothing that that Film can't do.,positive
Take them to teh mattresses!,positive
bad ass movie cannot mess with this one.,positive
Its all about who I was with for me...,positive
mind blowing performances....the best ending ive ever watched in film history and my 2nd favorite after godfather part 2,positive
A move from the youuth to manhood,positive
This movie just over flows with class the whole way though. Legendry film that is a must watch.,positive
"rien a ajouter, un chef d'oeuvre!",positive
"not too bad, too much violence though",negative
Did not like it. Deal with it. Its the most boring thing I have ever been forced to try to watch under peer pressure.,negative
The Greatest Movie ever made. Enough Said.,positive
the best movie ever.,positive
"La mejor Peli de la historia . Si no la viste no viste nada !!! es solo mi opinion, es la unica que se me ocurre recomendar a cualquiera , cualquiera sea tu gusto",positive
"Not a huge fan of Mafia movies, but this wasn't bad at all.",positive
Yo creo que si no es la mejor es una de las mejores de todos los tiempos ....,positive
"Perfect in every way. Directing, set design, writing, cinemtography, acting (right down to the smallest roles). There's not a hair out of place in this masterpiece. Vito's death might be the most artfully shot scene in cinema.",positive
The all time classic,positive
one of the greatest movies ever made!,positive
"""I believe in America""",positive
The greatest movie of all.,positive
"Really good, it was kinda long but it still kept me interested",positive
"Honestly, one of the best out there. No reliance on senseless violence. Pacino can scare you just by yelling.",positive
Power packed performance...,positive
Motherfucking Classic. No words to desribe,positive
The best mob movie of all time. It had a rich mixture of the Italian culture both in America and Italy.,positive
"one of the greatest of all time & this 4sure the greatest part of all the trilogy... if u haven't seen this movie,or think anything bad about it ... go 2 hell & kill urself dopey !! fro me it's all about Marlon Brando he's sooo brilliant in his role ... also Nino Rota's music score is unforgettable ....",positive
"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.",positive
One of the best movies of all time. One of my personal favorites of all time. Can I give 6 stars.,positive
What can I say...I love Italian!!!,positive
without a doubt the best one of the series,positive
I do not need to explain why this gets 5 stars.,positive
Marlon Brandon Idolo!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"certainly a flawless film. there is simply nothing about this movie that wasn't just about perfect. terrific writing, amplified by wonderful acting (anyone who denies brando's greatness, should not be allowed to watch another film). directing is artistic and meaningful, and the action is done tastefully, and never gratuitously. the theme of family is strong throughout, and everything seems to develop it well. for some reason, however, upon the first viewing it didn't resonate with me. i have no complaints, it just didn't really speak to me. this is why i had to keep it from a perfect score. i'm sure in the years to come, i will come to appreciate it more and more, and eventually raise the score, but for now, it just didn't impact me, and i have to dock points for that.",positive
"Flawless ...in every, possible way!",positive
Without question one of the greatest films of all time.,positive
"well, really nothing much to say other than that, it's simply the best movie ever made. it set the bar for great cinema.",positive
Greatest Mob movie ever. Period.,positive
"what a film, must c!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive
I think this one especially and also the second even the third one are both the mother& the father of all the mafia films..,positive
"this is a classic, and probably one of the greatest movies of all time.",positive
Quite simply one of the greatest films of all time!!,positive
"My favourite of all time i have to say.... Marlon Brando, Al Pacino.... classy film....",positive
An amazing movie and one of my favorites,positive
"The original gangster movie, everything since this has been a poor imitation",positive
Sencilllamente lo Mejor de lo MEjor!,positive
"""Neven seen better.""",positive
Tout simplement gÃ©nial. Le regard d'Al Pacino vous ferais glacer un verre d'eau en 30 secondes.,positive
It's not certainly boring. It is one of the best movies of cinema history.,positive
mafiosi et classe se retrouvent,positive
Totally agree with duggy the sequel is amazin but nothin beats the original. pure cinematic gold,positive
undoubtly one of the best mob movies ever made...the basis on which every other mob movie is judged upon.,positive
"Yksinkertaisesti hyvÃ¤, piste.",positive
the best movie ever!,positive
"One word...'absolutely brilliant', thats three, i cant count... My favourite movie, its just so good, brilliant script and brilliant storyline",positive
"Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and the nefarious Butcher Scene saved the movie.",positive
Las naranjas nunca tuvieron mejor sabor.,positive
No 2 favorite movie of all time!! CLASSIC!,positive
One of the best movies ever,positive
"This is the one that started it all as far as I'm concerned. Marlon Brando, James Cann, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire give outstanding performances in each of their roles. This is the story of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his place as the 'head' of all the families. The alternate plot is how his son Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) came into power. 'I never wanted this for my son Michael', Vito expresses with disappointment. This is a movie you have to watch - for if you don't - Vito Corleone will 'make you an offer you can't refuse'.",positive
Basically the perfect movie.,positive
Best Gangster Movie Ever,positive
best gangster movie of all time nothing will come close,positive
"Some people said that this was boring, but I defeintely didn't think so. It wasn't an action packed movie like many guess it would be, I really felt for the characters by the end. Making this by far my favorite movie.",positive
"No review needed, classic film, allows you to fall in love with the worst of the worst.",positive
one of the best gangsta movies-- characters are so vivid and it truly is my fav in the series..I especially like the ending scene,positive
one of the best movies ever,positive
"It insists upon itself, lol",positive
"Before you watch this movie, read the novel first so you'll get to know each character better and you got the idea how Vito Corleone turn out to be a gangaster from an unknown poor Italian Immigrant..",positive
ahh...luv.luve this movie! marlon brando..al pacino..robert duvall..i think they really played d part great!,positive
Make me an offer I can't refuse.,positive
simplement magnifique,positive
best film of all time,positive
Nothing to be said. The greatest movie ever made.,positive
Such a classic. This is what moviemaking is all about.,positive
"Number one all-time mafioso flick.Incredible cast,fogetaboutit!!",positive
"A masterpiece of modern philosophy. Great story, scenes, cast and music. The movie, together with other two parts makes a handful of morals.",positive
The ultimate crime saga ....a legend of a film.,positive
when it comes power its alwayz a man with a gun in his mind...marlon brando's and alpacino's true believe and intensity in the characters as godfather has made the movie an outstanding and a must see one,positive
"hard to be on the top,harder to stay there for long.",positive
"The film shows that evil and good are mixed in all of us. ItÂ´s not what we wanÂ´t to do, but what we end up doing, that really matters. Family bonds are good when you do good, but devastating when they make you do evil, all in the name of family, nation or religion.",positive
"La trilogie parfaite ! Une interpretation magistrale ! Une ecriture brillante ! Une realisation classique et inegalee ! Bref, vital ! Ai-je besoin d'ajouter qu'il s'agit de mon film prefere ?",positive
Amazing film! 2nd one is quality as well! Best film i've seen in ages!,positive
"Un des meilleurs films que je connaisse ! (par contre les 2 autres sont moins bien, a part la partie sur la jeunesse du Parrain dans le II)",positive
I saw it for the first time a few months ago and it is easy to see how it stands the test of time as one of the all-time cinematic masterpieces.,positive
Good movie... The story of the movie is very good. Acting is awesome especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino did a great job. I like it.,negative
"this is a great epic movie, a very powerful film.. even i didnt like the story of a mobster, but this film portray the love for a family.. and all the cast delivered they character magnifically.. and i love al pacino here..",positive
"An interesting take on the Mafia experience that urges the viewer to understand the mafiosos as something other than mindless guido thugs. It urges the viewer to think deeply about why people do seemingly stupid things, like joining the mafia.",positive
"Although The Godfather II might have been more intense plot wise, The original Godfather captured such a pure and real feeling to its characters. It also showed that a movie about the mafia doesn't have to be cheesy, cheaply produced and contrived.",positive
"One of this ""must see movie"". Brilliant!",positive
mi 4th favorite movie in the world,positive
Best mafia film. Fantastic performance by Al Pacino. great atmosphere.,positive
The Classic Gangster Movie,positive
"One of the most outstanding movies ever made in the history of cinema,with unbelievable performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino",positive
So close to perfection its just not funny.,positive
"Beautifully shot - brilliant cast, and a compelling story that's less about the Mafia, and all about a tragic hero, Michael Corleone.",positive
"If your a guy, this is a most own. Mario puzo's mob book could not of been better. Lighting , acting, directing,the music score, everything is so well put together in this movie. You like the sopranos, scarface, empire, kingpin, you name it this movie is the grand daddy of them all.",positive
"An amazing movie which started my love of mobster movies and Al Pacino. And of course, Brando is amazing.",positive
Excellent movie. Classic cast. Great story.,positive
"Quite possibly the best movie, ever!",positive
The theme song is on constant replay in my mind. It's my favourite movie (and made the year I was born).,positive
"copolla is slow, but that's ok",positive
he i'm gonna offer that you can refuse,positive
I will make him an offer he can't refuse...,positive
welcome to the family? welcome to my list of greatest films,positive
"Great movie, but not so good as second one. Anyway, great characters like Brando, Johnny Boy and Pacino.",positive
Epic. Too Epic though. It even seems like mafiosi are good guys.,positive
Marlon Brando Jr. is by far my most favorite actor EVER!,positive
"A little on the slow side, but a very good ride none-the-less. Very intellectually stimulating, and it has some great suspense scenes to boot. Keeps you glued to the screen the whole way through, rooting for the bad guys the whole time. Doesn't get much better than this.",positive
"I guess I just don't get it. This movie is the most god-awful boring thing that I have ever sat through. Literally, the only reason I watched more than 15 minutes of it is because we watched it in a class and I couldn't leave.",negative
As good as crime drama gets.,positive
"best i've seen marvellous,powerfull,i adore it",positive
"The movie offer I am gonna make you, that you can't refuse. Arguably (we still have Godfather 2) the best movie ever.",positive
Arguably the best ensemble cast ever.,positive
"The beautiful cinematography means this is a classic that improves with repeated viewings. I swear there are scenes which, when paused, look like old master oil paintings.",positive
You know what i think...,positive
"Great story... great actors,actress and La scilia...",positive
Classic. can watch it anytime.,positive
Simply a classic..set the standard in Mafia Series,positive
The best of the three in my opinion.,positive
Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece features Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in powerhouse perfomances. Taking the themes from Mario Puzo's novel the Oscar winning film gives a compelling view of the Sicilian Mafia.,positive
I'll give him an offer he can't refuse.,positive
it's the Godfather. it's the best. period.,positive
Tek kelime ile bir saheser...,positive
The best Godfather movie,positive
DON CORLEONE IS THE SHITS!!!,positive
This is a movie you can't refuse!,positive
Simply the best film of all time.,positive
the best fucking movie ever made,positive
Best gangster movie ever. Not even Scorsese can top it.,positive
...I'm probably the only person who fell asleep during it.,negative
"Amazing film, amazing story. The choreography of the Baptism and Murder scene is awesome.",positive
Did Brando have mumps? Did he have marbles in his mouth? No wonder he don't get no respect.,positive
Nothing can quite compare.,positive
not as good as EVERYONE says,negative
It's the kind of movie that I can't not watch when they play it on TV--and they play it on TV often...,positive
This and II are as good as movies get. A MAsterpiece.,positive
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse,positive
Classic movie for all real men! 5 Star rating hands down. The whole cast pull their own weight and there is a good emphasis on the story line. All in all its a realistic depiction of the Mafia realm of the 40s.,positive
this is my #1 favorite movie til i die,positive
part II is the best movie i've ever seen,positive
"the best film ever. Marlon, Al pacino, James Caan are superb. I watched it when I was too young. Later I watched it many times. Also you should see other sequels. If you are interested in crime movies, you must keep it.",positive
Speaks for it self....,positive
best I've seen yet. Liked 2 also but 3 was a lttle weak.,positive
Marlon Brando with cotton wool in his cheeks is still the world's greatest movie actor of all time. As for the music.... Wonderful.,positive
"Classic - the Baptism scene is the best movie scene ever. If you haven't seen this movie...well, what are you waiting for?",positive
"Lets get one thing straight, you have to watch the whole movie in full and pay close attention to the story. Hands down THE BEST MOVIE EVER IN MY PROSPECTIVE.",positive
defalarca izledim ama yine izlerim..:),positive
Simply the best gangster film ever made. Flawless throughout.,positive
no comment wonderful!,positive
"This movie is outstanding in every single respect. Amazing cinematography, brilliant acting, supreme script, steady pacing... it's almost impossible to find anything wrong with this film. I mean, I'm sure you can, but that's because you're a dick, and you probably think Crash, Garden State or Eternal Sunshine are better movies. This movie is always in the discussion for ""Greatest Movie Ever,"" and with good reason. Because it is. I mean, sure, you can dispute it, but honestly, what kind of argument can you throw towards somebody that will sway them otherwise. That's right, you can't. The Godfather is an absolute masterpiece. If you think of yourself as a ""movie"" person in any regard and haven't seen this, you're lying to yourself.",positive

"Original mob masterpiece in Coppola's trilogy is still an awesome movie to watch, whether you've seen it or not. Brando is at his best, and Al Pacino was beginning to hit his stride. James Caan has one of the coolest death scenes in cinematic history.",positive
J'aime cette trilogie de facon inegale mais je n'aimerais qu'on y change rien !,positive
The best movie ever made. One of the rare movies that gets better with time.,positive
5 dogos... marlon brando se roba la pelicula....,positive
There isn't much to say about this movie. Just watch it.,positive
"Good movie. I identify more with Casino, I don't know what it is. I don't understand how it's the greatest movie ever. I know it's got some American Dream aspect to it, some immigration commentary... I don't know. Maybe I'll watch it again.",positive
Best movie ever made.,positive
Forse la trilogia piÃ¹ celebre della storia del cinema,positive

no t podi morir sin verla porq es impresionantemente buena,positive
"Perfect, perfect, perfect",positive
great movie. They didn't even want Pacino in the film origanally. They didn't think he was good until they did the scene where Al shoots the cop in the face.,positive
The Greatest movie of all time. A must watch if you have never seen it. A masterpiece in Motion picture and every scene is memorable truly great.,positive

The best movie ever!,positive
"Recommended..highly..I once spent a whole day watching the trilogy, and by far this was the film out of the three that was really 'something' a beautifully made film, very dark and slick, classy and stylish mise-en-scene in almost every shot, great performances from Al Pacino and the late Marlon Brando, on the whole a great film..",positive
a perfect movie with perfects actors,positive
"I've always loved mafioso films, and this is the king of those all.",positive
"My all time favourite movie of all time. The Godfather is perfect in every aspect of filmaking (acting,directing,writing,etc) This is what films should be like",positive
Stunning. Just stunning.,positive
"It's not about murder and it's not about mobsters, it's about family and destiny. No matter what Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) does to prevent it, he must fulfill the role his father always wanted him to avoid. Bare witness to the transformation of an American Patriot to an American Gangster.",positive
"The story of a King and his three sons. One with his aggressivity, with his childish innocent, and one with his cunning intelligence. Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall delivers a sublime cinematic experience.",positive
amazing i dont want to get on the wrong side of Al pacino,positive
One of the best all around movies of all time. No words can describe it.,positive

one of the best movies in history! Marlon Brando and Al Pacino all the way! You suck if u never seen this movie,positive
"POWERFUL !! Classic gangster flicks about New York italian mob. It's great, I loved the whole serie. Directed with great actors, simply a beautiful WORK OF ART!",positive
"One of the best movies of all times. Great dialogue, storyline, character interaction.",positive
"One of my top 10 movies. It has it all! Great actors, great scenery, great story and great music. If you are going to see one mafia movie ever - see the Godfather!",positive
"""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse""",positive
Top 5 All Time Best. Perfect.,positive
this is the best of the trilogy,positive
"Not as good as i expected it to be, far too long, basically an extended episode of the sopranos.",negative
"Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are stellar. Most people like II, which is good, but I liked this one best. The creation of Michael Corleone is a fascinating insight.",positive
"Great movie from a great series. This film has it all. The cinematography is brilliant, but in a very subtle way. The way the movie is filmed is brilliant in a subtle way. The shots are all well planned for dramatic effect. The score for this movie is very good. The only reason I rated this as a 4.5 stars instead of 5 was because I thought it lacked a certain level of realism at points. I think realistically, mafia-related movies need to have more internal gang conflict to make sense, when in this, most of the enemies are obvious and relatively distant from the main character. They also do very little to establish what exactly, besides whacking people and later, las vegas, was making all the money the characters had.",positive
The only Godfather I really sat through to the end without skipping anything. It's alright.,negative
Best Mob Movie EVER! Love it!!!!,positive
A classic Mobster movie and #1 on Bravo's Best Movies Ever list,positive
"classic and unforgetable. if you want to see a film about the glamour, nobility and heirarchy of cosa nostra then watch this, but if you want to see a more honest film about more common sicilian thugs watch goodfellas",positive
Has to be the greatest mafia movie ever made. Pacino is phenominal,positive
No doubt one of the greatest films.,positive
The most amazing movie ever. Dont you miss the days when parts 1 2 adn 3 of a movie were all good.,positive
The Corleone family in all their destructive glory!,positive
Best movie ever made!,positive

"Brando, Pacino and James Caan in a classic epic. The first of a brilliant series of three.",positive
"Not much to say. The greatest film in the history of the art. Marlon Brando delivers the most unforgettable performance by an actor ever. (apart from Arnold in ""Batman & Robin...)",positive
brett & i love to watch this movie together. it is pretty much the most amazing movie ever made.,positive
"I admire the books, and the movie ofcourse is not as good, but watched it witg delight",positive
The horse's scene is the wave!,positive
"Classic, stylish, an example of brilliant American filmmaking.",positive
I Believe in America.,positive
I can say nothing about Don Corleone.that was my favorite.,positive
"Absolute classic. One watches this movie, and is almost saddened by the way most movies nowadays don't even come close. You know its a good movie when the Don finally dies. This man was absolutely wicked to the core, an evil mobster, but with the way the scene is built up, upon his death, you get the feeling a truly great man has passed, and that things would've turned out differently had Michael been more like the Don.",positive
"Klassikko. Suosikkina ""Enzo the baker""",positive
number 2 just takes it...............i think but its close,positive
The best movie classic EVER! love Don Clorleone....,positive

Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh School of Life.,positive
"can never be surpassed , except the godfather 2,",positive
"Classic. This movie has it all, drama, comedy, violence, tragedy, and funny comedy thats dramatically tragic. If you havent seen it yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up.",positive
What can I say? This is a breakthrough film about some of my ancestors and the government within a government they tried to create to take care of their people. Awesome!,positive
The best movie ever made!,positive
"A man who does not spend time with his family, is not a real man!",positive
Clearly the greatest movie ever made... nuff said,positive
"Just saw this for the first time last weekend. I can see why it became a classic -- incredible acting, interesting story line, and what is up with Brando's jaw? ;)",positive
In this film Marlon Brando demostrates how Method acting and stanislavsky's acting can be really successful. The film is like playing a video game you just want to play on and on till the end of the game.,positive
"classics. 1&2 are fantastic, 3 was needed, purely 4 closure. 4 those who haven't seen them theres obviously something very wrong wid u.",positive
"The greatest movie ever made, bar none!",positive
"I still say that Marlon Brando has the most hilarious death scene in this film, especially compared to the violent end other characters have.",positive
"Great performances all around, gets better after each viewing",positive
Needs no intro from me... A classic even if you hate the genre,positive
chyba nawet moglabym tym bossem byc.,positive
One of the all time greats.,positive

"If you havent seen this, I oughta slap you. Truly one of the superb pieces of art to come from earlier cinema. A must-see must-have for the ages.",positive
An offer I couldn't refuse...,positive
great movie...but not true to life and alot of people don't know why its great,positive
"An Epic showing the Pacino Magic! Simply stunning work that gets better with age. Considering the cast of Caan, Duvall and Brando it was a sensational effort to steal the show.",positive
"Que pelicula, mi favorita de todas",positive
This movie is the real deal.,positive
Wow. This movie is one of the most perfectly made movies ever. It is top notch and outstanding. I could go on and on but who actually reads these,positive
"I have seen this dozens and dozens of times, yet I have no recollection of it at all. But I hear it's good!",negative

I don't even have to say anything. Never go against the family.,positive
best mafia movie i have ever seen i grew up on this movie since i was 6 or 7. Al Pacino is awesome,positive
"What can you not lov about this canoli-eating-mafia-killing-family? ""Leave the gun, take the canoli""....awesome movie",positive
I think this is the best movie ever!,positive
"This is not just a movie with excelent actors and actresses. It is a movie that teach strategy. It is amazing how this kind of think happened in the real life, without guns but the rest similar.",positive
The Godfather is everything that is good and right in the world.,positive
Coppola's masterpiece! The best movie every produced.,positive
"no review is needed, if you havent seen it, you have a problem",positive
"La mejor, la unica, increible, hizo historia, marco una nueva era, lo tiene todo... creo que voy a llorar",positive

My favorite movie of all time. Simply great!!!,positive
Recomiendo a Todos mis Amigos ver esta pelÃ­cula como parte de su vida... Aunque eran mafiosos eran conscientes de algunas cosas... Prestar suma atencion a la primera escena de la pelÃ­cula...,positive

My favourite movie of all time! A movie everybody should see atleast 1 time,positive
One of the best movies ever made. Watching this movie is like watching a chess game where the pieces are all criminals and you never know where some people's loyalties lie. The transformation of Michael from love struck kid to the head of the most brutal family in New York is why Pacino became who is today.,positive
"I love the second one too (well the Vito flashbacks). Vito is an admirable villain (I feel bad for even calling him that), but Michael is just cold.",positive
If you are out for dinner with Al Pacino...never EVER let him go to the bathroom unaccompanied,positive
what can i say that hasn't been said? THE mobster movie.,positive

"Un film culte. Image, histoire, musique, tout est (presque) parfait.",positive

"clasico de los clasicos, me quedo con la segunda parte, al pacino se las manda",positive
The only good one in the over rated series.,positive
great movie! this movie will live forever and every generation will love it!,positive
"Few films deserve the title ""epic."" Coppola's brilliant adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel certainly earns that designation. The first of a trilogy, The Godfather is a timeless story of family, struggle, love and loss. As gritty as it is opulent, the Corleone family rules an empire that is charged with timeless conflict. Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall, Keaton...fantastically cast. My favorite quote? ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" Definitely on my top 10 of all time.",positive
All the italian I know comes from this film. Fantastic!!,positive
All you Scarface fans should watch this...I mean food for though get a plate!,positive
"best movie in history, without a doubt. nothing will ever beat it.",positive
"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" Don Corleone",positive
"The scene where Al Pacino revenged the attempted murder of his father made me reflect on my own coming of age. I didn't have to kill anybody though, just wear a made in Italy suit and learn to knot a tie.",positive
Any full-blooded man should watch this.,positive
THE.BEST.FILM.EVER.MADE.,positive
A true classic...who couldn't love this movie?,positive
Maybe Brando's best performance and of the greatest performances in the history of movies. Also Pacino is outstanding in the role that made him famous.,positive
One of the best ever made... by some of the best actors to have ever worked.,positive
One of the two greatest movies ever made!,positive
The Corleone family stays with you once you've let them in,positive
"Classic, a must-seen",positive
The best of all Godfather movies,positive
Marlon Brando is soooo cool.,positive
"In the top three best movies ever!... Vito Corleone, need I say more.",positive
"The Godfather est surestimé mais ça reste du très bon cinéma. Les acteurs sont merveilleux, en particulier Brando et la réalité du crime organisé est peint avec beaucoup de réalisme.",positive
Really great performence by Marlon Brando,positive
a masterpiece seen it 5 times!Marlon Brando IS the Godfather!,positive
marlon brando is fantastic,positive
One of the earlier work of al pacino that labelled him as the godfather of hollywood. A must see if you're interested in the life of a mafia,positive
"Un excelente reparto, clasico del cine",positive
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse,positive
What can I say. Having a Dad from this region of Italy shows just how well this film has captured the essence of Southern Italy and family life. Stellar performances from the whole cast. I can watch it and watch it and.................,positive
"Well,it's Coppola. I think that says it all.filled with talented actors and great directing work this movie is a classic!",positive
No words needed to be spoken here.,positive
izleyin ve sonra Ã§ekilen tÃ¼m mafya filmlerinin ilham kaynaÄÄ± olduÄunu gÃ¶rÃ¼n,positive
"Powerful mafia epic which all though lacked in direction in spells, is still enthralling watching this, at times, immoral family. The heart of this family was shown in full in the sequel.",negative
The perfect movie...,positive
"Thought I wouldn't like this, but I did",positive
"If you have not seen this movie, you must do so now.",positive
THIS IS MOVIE GREATNESS!!! I mean how many movies have sooooo many quotes that apply to so much in life!!,positive
the greatest movie ever made hands down and no one can say anything else about it.,positive
Maybe the greatest movie of all time. Perfect filmmaking and acting on every level.,positive
"One of the best movies ever made, The Godfather gets everything perfect and has an intangible quality that has never been recreated, other than in it's sequel",positive
Maybe the best film ever made.,positive
Dude. Don't mess with Corleone.,positive
The family is the most important thing for a real man,positive
"Perfect, just perfect!",positive
"My favourite movie of all time, and i dont give a fuk if it is obvious or unoriginal, theres a reason ppl think this movie is awesome",positive
"As always, a sweeping, beautiful, and macabre film...the only sad part is part III which does not measure up on any level, this is only reason for four stars.",positive
"If i know someone that has this movie placed below four stars, we WILL be having a chat. One of the best American made movies by far. Francis Ford Coppola was amazing here. Acting is impeccable. Definitely in my top 5 #2 on the AFI's Top 100 Movies",positive
The best movie ever !!!,positive
What an amazing film. And many have stolen from it since its release.,positive
absolutely incredible,positive
"This movie is amazing. The acting of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Roert Duvall, and others is outstanding.",positive
Fantastic adaptation of the book!,positive
If you havent seen this trilogy. You're not worth breathing,positive
"greatest movie of all time. hands down. if you haven't seen it, watch it. if you have, watch it again. i can understand why some think it starts off a little slow, but just stick in there and you'll find yourself loving it, too.",positive
best movie of all time,positive
"I tried to see it 3 times, and I couldnÂ´t. But when I did it, I saw the other 2 in a couple of days. Finaly I understood why this film is considered one of the greatest movies of all the times.",positive
"since i've never seen this movie, i will instead review ken burns' 18 HOUR BASEBALL DOCUMENTARY which originally appeared on pbs in 1994. i am doing this because flixter does not include BASEBALL. i actually have very little to say about it aside from the fact that i totally love it and in disc 2 you get to learn about both the MERKLE BONER and ty cobb. disc nine include a bit about the 1986 mets, but does not mention their rampant cocaine use one bit. my one major complaint is the lack of coverage of larry dahl, the ty cobb of 1970s spanish independent league baseball. i was hoping that flixter would cut me off at some point, forcing me to continue this review on the godfather 2, but that seems unlikely at this point. =(",positive
"No me canso de verla, es una pieza de arte",positive
classic. the godfather of all mafia flix.,positive
"An American Classic and one of the greatest films of all time for that matter finds Al Pacino as the reluctant heir to a mafia organization after his threatened father and inept brothers fail. With drama and violence at every turn. Beautifully and realistically photographed. Featuring great performances by all, especially Brando whose performance is imitated often but always comes up short.",positive
This is the best movie ever made!!!,positive

"One of the best films of all time. Starring Brando as Vito Corleone, the head of one of the NY mafia families, and charts the rise and fall of his empire as he struggles to control the family empire after an attempted assassination. Pacino plays the son who is forced to choose between a promising career and taking care of his family business. We see the switch in the epic scene in the restaurant as Michael retrieves the gun from the cistern and kills the corrupt cop and the rival mobster, thus sealing his destiny forever. Based on the Mario Puzzo novel, and with a mesmerising score, this is as good as it gets in movies. The sequel just gets better.",positive

I'll make you an offer you can't refuse>,positive
"Very well done. The scenes turned out to be almost exactly as I had imagined them when reading the book! But because I read the book first, the movie seemed quite rushed. The fast pace is obviously understandable because the book is so detailed that it would take 10 movies at least to truly cover the entire Godfather world. This movie is definitely a must-see for everyone, especially those into the mafia-type movies, games, etc. The book is infinitely better though, so if you know how to read, you better read the book too. You won't regret it!",positive
"Great movie, although you should watch the movie before you read the book, or else you'll be sorely disappointed by the movie.... like me",positive

There aren't enough stars for me to rate this properly . . .,positive
"My favorite activity if I have 3 hours to kill is to pop in The Godfather trilogy special edition DVD [a must have for every man's home] and step into the late 1940 adaptation of New York mob life. The chilling waltz, the raspy voice, a well represeneted version of the novel written by Mario Puzo. The legend, the saga, this is my all-time favorite movie. Go to the matresses.",positive

"The best Mafia film ever - and the ""behind the scenes"" stories are amazing..",positive
Well made and very interesting... if you don't find this movie interesting your probably suffering brain damage of some sort...,positive
"All this movie really is is just a bunch of bad folk killin each other off, left and right, or just screwing with each other in general. It's like watching a rap beef, except a bit bigger than that, but not quite as big as like, a genocide or something. Except, you know, it's fake. So, you know, why should I care? About these fake bad people fucking with each other? You know? It's micropolitics on a scale so small involving subjects so dumb and nonexistent, I have a hard time with that caring thing. Don't get me wrong though. It does have its high moments. It's just... the moments that aren't are usually so boring and so damn dragged out. I still suggest you give this movie a try at least, form your own opinion on it, but for me, this flick was mad, mad, mad, mad, madly overrated. I wouldn't blame you if you can't finish it though when you attempt to watch it. I only made it to the part where the dude gets shot in the cornfield while the other dude takes a leak. A little after this point, I came to the conclusion that the movie wasn't going to get any better, was mostly boring up to this point anyway, and I really didn't care that the man in the car had just been killed. So... I turned it off and did something better with my life. But still. Try it at least. See if you can make it through 45 minutes to an hour of it, at least. If it's still not your bag, just turn it off and keep going on with the rest of the world.",negative

"I love every second of this movie. Like eating the best food, it never gets stale.",positive
greatest mafia family tale ever!,negative
Simply The Best Movie I've ever seen,positive
This is one of the best mob movies in the world. I love the scene with horse's head. That's a classic.,positive
Perhaps the best film of the '70's.,positive
Pacino's overnight transformation from straight arrow to mob boss just isn't believable.,negative
ill make him an offer he can't refuse... best line ever,positive
"A flawless film, classic in every way.",positive
"The greatest movie of all time, you better believe it!",positive
"A great movie, perhaps my all-time favorite, not only for its epic storyline, which in its own right is truly moving, but for the manner in which it allows us to see an other facade of the stereotyped ""mobster"". Great movie, in every sense of the word.",positive
the best mob movie ever,positive
I was a Corleone in my previous life. =),positive
"Marlon Brando, nuf said!",positive
"probably the best movie in the world, intriguing and meaningful",positive
mÃ¼kemmel Ã¶tesi 5+ yÄ±ldÄ±z :D,positive
Like Goodfellas it is not perfect but a 5 star rating for me means top 10% and this most definately is.,positive
Classic all time favorite,positive
"Perfect. Pacing, depth, and character development is all perfect.",positive
"The best movie ever made. The performances, the pacing, and the story are all on the same level. This an example of a movie where all the tonal decisions were made correctly -- perfect direction.",positive
best movie ever made,positive
sooooooooo good. my fave,positive
Arguably the best movie ever made.,positive
"Perhaps the greatest film of all-time. Should've been #1 by AFI. from the incredible acting, including marlon Brando, a young Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, t o the cinemetagrahy, them music, the writing. This is not just a gangster movie, but it's a powerful epic spanning a decade on how a family business manages to thrive despite the head's condition and the vulnerability to its enemies. The final scene was pure classic.",positive
what else can you say?,positive
"an old classic that is still among the best, pay attention or you'll miss whats really going on in this awesome mobster flick",positive
"the best of the trilogy, by far... ppl complain about the accents, but really if you go to brooklyn and sit in an italian place for a day you will understand it easily",positive
The greatest drama ever told and probably the best movie ever made.,positive
best gangster movie ever period full stop,positive
This was Francis' crown jewel.,positive
This is the greatest movie of all time.,positive
Timeless classic ! everyone should have this in there collection ! capiche,positive
The beginning chapter of the greatest story in movie history.,positive
Anyone who knows me knows I'm obsessed. Seriously can't live without watching the trilogy at least once a month. Nuff said.,positive
"Watched the whole trilogy this Nov while sick with a cold and remembered when I first saw it years ago how theatrical and moving the scenes were, and still are.",positive
You don't get films like this anymore,positive
ei tarvitse perustella,positive
Simply one of the best movies ever.,positive
"Wow. Really, really good. Way better than I expected. Awesome.",positive
Just brilliant. Esp. Michael getting pulled into a life of organised crime in a display of misguided duty. Who wouldn't?! Esp. if your dying father happened to be Marlon Brando.,positive
Intense! First half was a bit boring but the second half goes by in a flash.,positive
Words cannot describe this movie.,positive
"I want to see this movie everyday of my life...""make sure everybody see's the cake before you cut it"" - Kyle Bollin",positive
"All-times best. Coppola's masterpiece. In Antalya, I had the chance of seeing his last film Yout Without Youth. He is still triying new things, which is good.",positive
The best casting ever....my favorite,positive
It's kind of cute. You get sick of it if you watch the whole thing at once.,positive
"Pure genius. Slow perhaps, but 1970'ies movies always are.",positive
"A must see, must have classic!",positive
"I don't usually like gangster films. But this film is considered a classic for a reason. It is only outdone by its sequel, which is also a classic.",positive
"Well made, epic, and tremendously powerful.",positive
I watch this movie at least once a month.,positive
La mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos,positive
The best movie and book ever!,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time,positive
sin dudas la mejor pelicula de la historia,positive
"Although Brando and Pacino are the two names most synonymous with this movie, I think James Caan steals the show.",positive
The blue print of all tales movies and things mafioso. A compelling pacey and exciting tale bettered only by the book which if you haven't read it and you think you like the movie will blow you away like a Scicillian hit man. I have watched the movie over a dozen times after reading the book and the book creates a clarity that can only be likened to a succesful laser eye operation..!!,positive
One of the best movies of all time.,positive
All time favorite movie,positive
Simply the best movie ever.,positive
The Best Mafia Movie Ever Made...,positive
Better than I claim. Not as good as others say.,negative
love everyone of the godfathers and the books by mario puzo are brilliant as well x,positive
Brando Ã¨ di una bravura che si meriterebbe di essere inserito nei libri di storia,positive
"absolutly amazing film! its an all time great for a reason and anyone who hasnt seen it, must watch it. I for one still havent got round to watching the 2nd and 3rd ones yet! but one day i shall!!!",positive
"This (and the sequel) are now ""must haves"" in a top ten list ; some lists perhaps include them as sign of self-bravado on a complilers list, but these films truly are landmark, maverick film making.",positive
I make him an offer he cant refuse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
Yeah it was ok. I mean brilliant.,positive
Mario Puzo nun kitabindan sonra daha da degeri artmis bas taci edilesi muhtesem film,positive
Rightly ranked as one of the top motion pictures of all time. Pacino steals this from Brando.,positive
El referente de las peliculas mafiosas. CÃºando tendremos una del tigrillo y la mafia mexicana... aunque tendrÃ¡ que parecerse mÃ¡s a scarface... ni hablar,positive
"One of the best movies ever. Wonderful cinematography, great acting and beautiful music. Totally a classic. Brondo's best performance.",positive
Alors faut tous les voir Ã  la suite c'est vraiment un grand film.. MARLON BRANDO my god! rien que pour ce gÃ©ant du cinÃ©ma et Al Pacino.. De Niro,positive
"A fucking classic!! Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant director and really hits you hard with characters, visual elements(like horse heads) and the emotion of the characters. A staight up gangsta classic.",positive
I feel like everyone likes this movie b/c they're suppose to. Give me Casino or Goodfellas anyday.,negative
The Bests Movies Of mafia in The Fucking World and This Is A Fact,positive
"A true classic, love it.",positive
The best movie ever made!,positive
maybe this wud be my all-time-favourite movie,positive
Classic gangster movie. Definately epic.,positive
"There are few movies that will ever rate as high to me as this. The film is perfect in nearly every way and although there are films out there that I would rather watch, none so far have reached the quality of this film.",positive
"So many movies owe their existence to this one film. Scorcese when he still cared. Brando when he had a crumb of sanity left. Young, hungry Pacino. The ever-brilliant Robert Duvall. Can't miss it. American film making at its most epic, soul ripping best.",positive
all time movie for the mob films . good fuckin movie,positive
The OG American Gangster,positive
"This is an amazing movie. Period. Marlon Brando really plays the role of the Godfather quite well. The story line is intense, and takes a couple of times to really understand it. Great movie",positive
A must see iver and over. . .,positive
seriusly i have it practically memorized,positive
Brilliant beginning to end,positive
"one of the best movies ever made, and the best of the trilogy",positive
My favourite Mafia movie.,positive
I really need to see this movie,positive
"classic, i love this movie",positive
You cannot go wrong with this classic tale. Some of the best lines in movie history!,positive
coppola you magnificant bastard. now go run off and ruin yourself in the process of making apocalypse now.,positive
Every time you see it you love it! A Classic!,positive
"i'll make him an offer,he can't refuse es deli divane marlon baba",positive
Al Pacino in his finest role. Every actor was perfectly suited for their respective role. Rest in peace Marlon.,positive
Al Pacino est EXCELLENT ( oui oui j'sais c'est pas un film des annÃ©es 80 :p),positive
BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!,positive
The first is always the best. Never seen a better movie. Thus is a movie that will last a lifetime.,positive
"This movie is awesome. Period. If you don't like this movie...well, we just can't be friends!",positive
one of the best movies ever made,positive
Another one of my best ever.,positive
one of the best movies i the world.,positive
sÃ¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥ lÃ¤nge sen jag sÃ¥g denna film. lÃ¥ng Ã¤r den men stÃ¤mningen som byggs upp Ã¤r riktigt grym och knns genuin.,positive
Masterpiece. Greatest gansters movie of all time.,positive
A classic... very interesting photography too!,positive
I guess this movie does require any review at this stage. Abolsutely brillaint. I have lost count on how many times I have seen this movie,positive
this is the BEST movie EVER made (all 3 parts)!!!!,positive
A classic American film.,positive
One of the best movies of all time. Coppola delivers us a memorable classic that I will never forget.,positive
The best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
the bible for filmmaking,positive
"I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse! What else can you say, the greatest american movie ever made!",positive
"There so much I could say about this movie...while Coppola is not one of my all around favorite directors...I hate the grainy visual warmth of all these Godfather movies...all the colors of every scene make you feel that Thanksgiving's around the corner...with all the browns and oranges...but that's purely an aesthetic critique...Brando and Pacino: both being modest and at their best...these actors are known for their rampant difficultly and selfishness...but they nail their roles here...probably one of the best known scores ever composed...while Act III is a little drawn out, the climax (the Baptism/Executions) is one of the most tantalizing scenes in film...I get chills every single time. Finally, Pacino's transformation from good-natured, reluctant-Mafioso, ex-Marine to the Heir to the Corleone Crime Family is amazing...in Act I his eyes are dopey and naive...by Act III he is cold & ruthless. Powerful film...",positive
"A great example of a great movie. Simple, effective. A bit tiresome on the middle, but it can be forgiven.",positive
This movie needs no introduction. It is better every time you watch it.,positive
What can you say 35 years later? Absolutely riveting.,positive
"of course,so well paced. plus al pacino is just as good as brando in it. john cazale too,",positive
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.,positive
"There is a reason why this film is held in high regards. Having read the book everyone casted for this film was on point. One of Pacino's finest performances. Scarface, GoodFellas and all other Gangster films take a step back, the king is here.",positive
"DeNiro, Pacino; what's not to love.",positive
"The best and always will be the best. Not just because its a ""guy"" movie or just because it's a ""popular"" film but because it's the best. A ""guy"" movie is something like ""Die Hard"" or ""RAMBO"" (both series suck. and yes that is final) but this...this is something else entirely....it's a way of life...",positive
The dark side of the American dream. Genius.,positive
Incredible. Much more than just another gangster movie.,positive
It needs to be seen.,positive
quite possibly the greatest most complete movie ever made,positive
again one of the best of all times,positive
there's simply nothing to say.,positive
"la pelÃ­cula familiar por excelencia, realmente no sÃ© que tanto me gustarÃ­a si no fuera por mi padre y todo su fanatismo extremo por esta pelÃ­cula, al final mÃ¡s que recordarla por trama, la recuerdo por lo que significa en mi vida, miles de tardes de cine con mi papÃ¡ tomando coca cola y por eso es y serÃ¡ siempre excelente",positive
"""Is not personal""... When phrases froma movie blend into a worldwide culture... that's not a good movie... It's a History Icon",positive
i want to remind the last scene(Al Pacino said only NO),positive
This movie is a masterpiece. I never wanted so much to be a Scillian ganster. Arguably one of the best movies of all time. Coppola at his best. Brando at his best. Fantastic!!!!,positive
i made him an offer he couldn t refuse,positive
The Best Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"The best mafia movie ever. But most of the movie talks about family and responsibility, not as violent as you think...",positive
"Has never, will never, be bettered as a piece of cinematography. As near perfect as it could be.",positive
es increible no tiene ningÃºn defecto,positive
The greatest American film of all time.,positive
Al Pacino is such a bad @$$!!,positive
if its the last movie i have to see before i die. it's this. XDD,positive
"Classic masterpiece! It is THE movie, not entertainment.",positive
"SÃ¶ylenecek laf yok, tek kelimeyle mÃ¼kemmel.",positive
Best Movie Of All Times!!!,positive
Finns inte mycket att sÃ¤ga...den ultimata filmen!!!,positive
"The best movie ever made!! I defy anyone to come up with a better script, cinematography, performances, score, following, you name it.",positive
Excellent! I couldn't take my eyes off this movie.,positive
I'll make him an offer he don't refuse,positive
Is there anything that hasn't been said? Brilliant! The father and godfather of all wiseguy films. Would you expect anything less? It's Coppola...,positive
I did not see this movie until I was an adult and not until around 2002. I just was never interested in gangster movies. I did not know this was MUCH MUCH more than that. WOW!,positive
Fantastisk film... Kanske Pacinos bÃ¤sta.,positive
One of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
Fantastic. Everything about it is well done. Perhaps slow-paced but a solid film all around. The characters and drama were the best parts.,positive
Legendary... A must see for everyone!,positive
"undefinable, greatest movie ever made.",positive
"Not the best of the Godfather trilogy, but still pretty good.",positive
'I'll make him an offer he can't refuse':D,positive
Great book and great movie!,positive
I love Al Pacino as Michael Corleone and James Cann as Sonny Corleone..Best movie ever!,positive
I cry everytime...too touching,positive
"Epic, complex family novel. No mobster movie, thank god.",positive
"Un patriarche, une grande famille, la quÃªte du pouvoir, des rivalitÃ©s fraticides, des intrigues de cour, des trahisons, des meurtres, du sang et de l'amour. Le film qui m'a fait aimer le cinÃ©ma.",positive
only the best movie ever made!,positive
"By far the greatest picture in American cinema history. A solid story , an all star cast , a wonderful score , and a director that was on the top of his game.",positive
"A gangster classic. One of the best movies of the 70's. Score, Direction, Acting, Editing are all top class.",positive
"A freakin' masterpiece. Coppola is a genius. Brando is a God!!! Although I think I like the 2nd even more, if that is humanly possible.",positive
ILL MAKE THEM A DEAL THEY CANT REFUSE,positive
"I feel compelled to give this one five stars for it's mood, acting script, etc. Besides, one must never speak against The Family!",positive
Truely a masterpiece.,positive
BAM! This movie is HOT! LOL!,positive
"words cant describe this film its a masterpiece nothing comes close its Pacinos best performance, he didnt yell as much. must see",positive
This Has To Go Down As One Of The All Time Greats.,positive
"Excellent. Don Vito isn't a fictional character, he's real and bears a striking resemblence to Marlon Brando.",positive
Possibly(?) the best movie ever. Il Padrino!,positive
not the best out of all of em but still amazing,positive
"""I'll make you an offer..."" ;-)",positive
One of the best movies of all time!!!,positive
Didn't Apollonia's breasts look wierd?,positive
The best movie I've ever seen,positive
"I'm sorry, are you going to tell me you don't like this movie?",positive
Brilliant rendition of an amazing story.,positive
Ultimate mafia movie,positive
"One of the best films ever made, probably top 5 or 10. An achievement rarely seen in film throughout the last 100 years. Brando is the man.",positive
This is the best movie ever made!!!,positive
"If movies were still this good, then I'd be willing to pay the 9.50 per ticket.",positive
Un des classique du genre (et j'aime beaucoup le genre). respect !,positive
"Scenes are breathtaking, creative roles, very creative, art at its finest, strong performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pachino",positive
Damn near perfect movie-making.,positive
"What can I say, its the Godfather. Perhaps the greatest film of all time, but 3rd on my list.",positive
i own this collection and it is one of my favorite films. it is a hard but real movie,positive
My second most favorite movie.,positive
for sure this is not a movie. THIS IS REAL. everything about this movie is great. brilliant performance. nothing like it not even close,positive
as good as the book!!,positive
"love it!! es interesante, dramatica! como se desarrollan lo hechos y la ironia !!! me encanto :P",positive
gotta love the Godfather!!!,positive
aussi bien qu'un cours de management,positive
"The shits, this movie is the shits.",positive
Masterpiece! 'nuff said.,positive
"without this film, I would've never been complete.",positive
I just enjoy how Marlon Brando sounds with cotton balls in his cheeks.,positive
"amazing but part ll is much better, part lll is very disappointing!",positive
Somehow I find myself watching this movie very regularly. I guess this is one the top movies ever made.,positive
The granddaddy of gangster films.,positive
simply one of my favorite movies of all time...,positive
"There's no point giving Godfather 5/5 because it really isn't that great of a movie. Italian people are gay, crime stories are boring and there's not one single 3D effect in it! Besides, everything feels such cliche since I've seen it all before...on Sopranos. ............SYKE!!!!!! Of course I'm kidding. Since everything is said about the greatest movie of all times I'm going to focus on something people haven't necessarely noticed: 1. Sonny Corleone looks like Bruce Springsteen 2. Mafia kicks ass",negative
"Vez que la veo de nuevo (y deben ir mas de 10 veces), vez que me vuelve a atrapar.. demasiada elegancia.. dialogos muy refinados y el clÃ¡sico ""I'm going to make him an offer that he canÂ´t refuse.."" Demasiada dosis de actores...",positive
"Las mujeres tienen las novelas, nosotros el Padrino",positive
"absolutly amazing film! its an all time great for a reason and anyone who hasnt seen it, must watch it. I for one still havent got round to watching the 2nd and 3rd ones yet! but one day i shall!!!",positive
Greatest Movie Ever Made! nuff said.,positive
Truely the greatest film of all time. also sound track rocks,positive
An offer I could not refuse...ok you just watch it before you die...,positive
"A very long but epic tale of ego's, family values but most of all, respect!",positive
The one that made Al pacino and Marlon Brando stars in there own rite without a doubt even better than Scarface a must for any persons collection?,positive
kÄ±saca harikulade...,positive
Truly the best film ever made,positive
my #1 favourite (over the past 2 years),positive
La mejor de la trilogÃ­a.,positive
A brilliant set of actors and superbly directed by Francis Ford Coppola.Marlon Brando in one of his best roles.,positive
"I was really impressed by this movie, awesome!",positive
"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" ""May their first child be a masculine child."" What a great movie, simply amazing. I love the old Mobster films from the 70s and 80s, they had a feel to them that filmmakers today seem to have lost. I really like the lighting in the opening scene, when we first see The Godfather, and I really like the way they did the epic scene with Sonny(James Caan) by the ticket booth. One of the best films of all time.",positive
Brando and Pacino - Nuff said!,positive
the best mafia movie ever,positive
"a true classic, love this movie very much. one of my all time faves..",positive
"Long, but one of the best movies coming out of the seventies. I made him a deal he couldn't resist...",positive
"Pacino, Brano, Duvall, Caan, and Keaton...no need to say any more",positive
i'm crazy about coppola's films,positive
"Amazing. The themes of power, family, deciet, and vengeance all take root in this masterpiece. I would recommend it to anyone. There isn't a scene that I don't like. Al Pachino plays Michael Corleone almost too well. After watching this movie, the actor is inseperable from the character.",positive
nothing to say really........,positive
"Not Coppoa's best. Yes. Great acting, though I'll still say you never get truly convinced as to why Michael turns over...Hey, that was released on my birthday!?! FIVE STARS!",positive
"This decent piece of art, tells us the history of creation and developing the contemporary cinema industry.",positive
"Amazing movie, casting, rules (italians) I just love to watch it ...few times a years I watch all of them in the same day...my godfather days!!!",positive
"We all have ""a godfather""",positive
The Greatest movie ever made. End of story.,positive
love this movie and book and the games great too,positive
best film of all time! there will never be another,positive
Al Pacino finitoooooo! ultimato! Watchoo watchoo!!!,positive
It's the Godfather and the mafia...need I say more?,positive
Have you seen it? If not why not? This is cinema at its finest.,positive
This only gets 4 and a half as Part II is better. What a film.,positive
The Godfather of Cinema.,positive
A legend among classic movies,positive
kinda boring but beautiful and compelling,negative
Det bÃ¤sta som nÃ¥gonsin har gjorts inom film!!!,positive
"This is a true example of what ""epic"" scope means to moviemaking. Enough said. Features some hauntingly beautiful scenes, superb dialogue, and a real ride of a plot.",positive
"If I were to have a son, and I knew that I would not be around to be his father and I had to choose one movie to make him a man, this would be it. This movie expalins alot of the rules to being a man, so many jewels.",positive
Marlon Brando is my hero. Literally.,positive
i will make you an offer and you will not reject.,positive
"Amazing, so buy it and watch it over and over.",positive
"It's a story about a family... Despite the great acting and directing, the last star goes missing due to my general dislike of mafia movies.",positive
"a film you need to watch when you have plenty of time free and with a clear open mind. just shows that no matter how clean you try to be, if you are surrounded by crooks, you are destined to fall.",positive
"This should be a part of every person's itinerary for great films. Bloody, yes. Morally ambiguous, yes. But also amazing and beautifully done. Still one of my faves",positive
Movie history! This movie can be discriped with one word: Greatness!,positive
"amazing milestone in films, the effects of which are still being felt",positive
great movie with superb acting and excellent script,positive
"Probably my all-time, how original! Love James Caan as Sonny.",positive
"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
Klassiker som kommer til Ã¥ leve for alltid.,positive
Classic. It lived up to the novel.,positive
One of the best ever. Nothing else to add,positive
The Most Successful Must-See film in the History Of Cinema!!!!! Marlon Brando's performance is beyond imagination.....,positive
Take the cannolli ..... leave the gun!,positive
"no tulihan se sitten lopulta katsottua. odotin tylsaa ja ylipitkaa paatosta, mut ei. kai se on myonnettava, etta mafiaelokuva voi olla hyva. musat oli hienot.",positive
the mafia classic movie,positive
"Incredibly well acted. Suspenseful, with plenty of twists and turns, but not so many as to be utterly confusing. A wonderful, wonderful movie.",positive
"Hollywood at its peak. Perfect storytelling, perfectly executed.",positive
I can't seem to sit through the whole thing...,negative
Talk about a family with issues!,positive
classic.. nothing else.. just classic..,positive
"sin lugar a dudas, la mejor peli del siglo 20... es como la biblia gangster y razon tiene Seinfeld en decir que la solucion a todo esta en el padrino.",positive
"They did the book justice. The Godfather shows us the lives of obnoxious people but we are not revolted. We are drawn into the lives, into the very minds of these mafia. This is a great epic, an excellent trilogy worth watching.",positive
the movie that started it all,positive
Take it to the matresses..... need I say more...,positive
"Long time before the Sopranos. The Mother of all gangsters movies. Understand Power and where it can go, Great cinematografy ! Great Cast and story. One can watch many times and learn-learn-learn... Must See MOVIE !",positive
"Very very disapointed. For a 'Mafia' there was A LOT OF TALKING. I kept sitting there hoping it would pick up. Though I did cry with the scene with James Caan, just becuase I like him.",negative
goddamn i love to watch this movie!,positive
Best movie of all time. No other words need to be said.,positive
A masterpiece in every single aspect.,positive
"good, a tale of intelligence greed and deception and Italians",negative
A freakin masterpiece,positive
"the ""godfather"" of all ganster films. This movie is prefect.",positive
"Quote family guy ""I have a confession... I just didn't like the godfather!"" Y do people like this movie???? its so damn BORING!!!!",negative
Classic. A must see.,positive
A great mafia movie.,positive
"i have seen this more times than i ever wanted to...and will be fine if i never see it again, but, it deserves credit as a great work of film.",negative
The best movie...ever.,positive
what can i say.. its GODFATHER!!,positive
"A lot of people prefer the sequel, but to me this movie is funner to watch because of all of magic that happens. This movie was not supposed to be succesful, but Coppola makes everything work because of his creativity and passion for the story. Writing, acting, characters, story are all top notch. I never tire of watching it.",positive
litt for langtekkelig,negative
"An absolute masterpiece. Excellent script, perfect acting, incredible story... Everything about it is just perfect. Wonderful themes of family and values.",positive
"lives up to the incredible book, and then some. seeing pacino grow into the eventual boss is fun to watch. signature performance for duvall.",positive
"Perfect. Brando at his very, very best.",positive
KummisetÃ¤ trilogia on ihan ykkÃ¶nen...!,positive
This is the best movie ever made.,positive
Love it. I have probably watched this movie more than any other.,positive
"Fabrizio (fidato guardaspalle di Michael in Sicilia) Le donne qui, sono come le lupare...",positive
the best gangsta flick i have ever seen in my life. Al Pacino's character development through the film is talent at its best. Do urself a favor and check it out.,positive
"romanticized in comparision to Goodfellas, but this was one of America's first looks into the Cosa Nostra upper eschelan...lots of themes, and crime isn't the biggest one....watch it if you haven't",positive
la mejor trilogÃ­a q existe...,positive
"ja, antagligen en av historiens bÃ¤sta filmer.",positive
"This ranks as one of the greatest films of all time due to its technical execution, its tight and dramatic plot, and its great acting/actors. It is one of the most well-rounded films of all time.",positive
The best film ever made in any genre. Nothing can touch this. You cant beat a great story with an amazing cast.,positive
I have now seen this from start to finish... I do not know how I lived before. This movie is gold...dipped in platinum and sprinkled with diamonds,positive
"Al Pacino is charming, his character is that of a despicable bastard. Marlon Brando's voice is so muffled and at times i didnt know whether he's speaking in italian or in english. i guess i have to learn italian to better appreciate this movie. If it has been ranked 3rd on AFI's list, i couldnt rate it poory either. ;)",positive
en baba 2. film... film sirketi al pacino oynamasin diye epey diretmis ...?!?,positive
This movie and the entire series is amazing.,positive
have to see it each 6 monts in ur life..again and again..a masterpiece.,positive
Ranking up there among the best movies ever. And by far the best of the triology,positive
This whole movie is incredible. Watching Michael struggle with his destiny is as heartbreaking as it is captivating but the ending. . . Oh the ending is what really makes this film superb. It kills me everytime I watch it.,positive
the first part of the greatist crime drama of all time,positive
another set of films i watch at every opportunity. quality!,positive
"Great acting, but too much drama and bloodshed....i get sympathy pains!!",positive
A perfect example of film. Brilliant!,positive
He has to give me an offer i cant refuse!,positive
"I'm not sure whether I prefer Brando's Oscar winning performance with cotton wool stuffed in his mouth or the under rated James Caan's as the hot headed eldest son. The key scene of course is when Al Pacino kills the police captain in a restaurant, which commits him forever to a life of crime.",positive
"It's a good movie, It shure is..",negative

"<i><b> Brando made Don Vito something we rarely see in movies: a tragicomic villain-hero, a vulnerable hood. The don is so close to a comic character -- the movie itself is so close to comedy -- that Brando's capacity to move us in the role is doubly impressive. At the end, it is the older Godfather's tenderness and sagacity we recall. The Godfather is a generational saga; it's also an action film; but above all, it catches the imagination of audiences because it suggests that the career of a gangster is not so very different from the career of a businessman or a politician. In scene after scene -- the long wedding sequence, John Marley's bloody discovery in his bed, Pacino nervously smoothing down his hair before a restaurant massacre, the godfather's collapse in a garden -- Coppola crafted an enduring, undisputed masterpiece. <i></b> VERDICT: ""Better Than Anything"" - My highest rating (Extremely Positive reaction).

"This review isn't really a review in the true sense of the word, its more like my general thoughts. I just came back from a screening of The Godfather in a theater full of film students. While i have seen the movie before, seeing it in this setting is hard to pass up and even harder to come by. I was waiting till this screening to properly review this movie, as it was the only way i could see it with a fresh eye. I don't think i have seen this movie completely in years. Though it was a shock that so many film students have not seen it. Though it was a more of a shock how big of a handful of students didn't seem to care to see it. Well I sure hope they saw what everyone was raving about, what all the hype was pointing to and what the IMDB community has been calling The Best Film Ever since its inception. If you have not seen this movie, stop reading this review. See it and then come back because i cannot talk about this movie enough without going into details. This sure isn't a movie you want to go into for the first time knowing too many details, especially major plot points. What made this particular screening so great is every other time i watched this film it was in a bedroom or living room with 1 other person (either my father or a friend). Never have i seen it in its entirety with more than that. Never mind a packed theater. While to others, its just a film score, but when the Paramount logo and the ever familiar Godfather theme filled the speakers of the theater, i was hooked once again. The opening shot, a long one, helps introduce what the Mafia do. While there is a happy wedding going on during the first 25 minutes or so, what really is going behind the scenes here is lots of illegal business and 'favors'. While to first timers, this is just a throwaway establishment scene for all the main characters and the purpose of the 'mafia' which you never hear referenced by name in this film. While it does that, how well it does it is invisible to a first timer. It sets up a lot of story which is used to perfection in the rest of the movie (and some in the later installments). Hearing natural reactions to the films moments was great. Most of which were laughs or moments of 'Oh Shit'. It made me notice a lot more than before seeing it with an audience. With simply one line from Carlo (who barely had any character development throughout the first half), ""Shut up and set the table"" he was instantly set up to be an asshole of a husband. The audience bought it instantly with one single line. Until this plot point is continued, nothing else is said. It does not take skill to write this, though it does take skill to know that is all you need to get the audience to buy a character. There were not 2 or 3 scenes or lines of speech to get this over with the audience, just one. Just like this, nothing was over emphasized in this movie. Every shot has a purpose. Every little line does something for the audience. When you have 30 characters for the audience to understand in 2 hours and 50 minutes, you sure as hell need every shot you can get. The crowd gave a great reaction to Michael's bold face lie to wife at the end of the film. I was glad to hear people were still awake, since most of the movie is silence from the audience, and with todays crowd of Transformers and 300 nuts, that could mean a lot of different things. Thankfully people seemed to enjoy this movie. I sure did and it reminded me why i came to film school in the first place. It does not take 12 dozen red and blue gels or hyper-slick editing or crazy camera moves to make a movie change the world. 5 Stars from me. Quite possibly the best film of all time. I still have yet to find one myself that is better. See it, see the sequel and see it again.",positive
You watch this film for Brando - and that's the way it should be.,positive
"""I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless. But not men"" Don Corleone",positive
"Filmen Gudfadern gjordes 1972 av Francis Ford Coppola, efter roman av samma namn vilken Ã¤r skriven av Mario Puzo. Filmen utspelar sig i USA och berÃ¤ttar historien om den italienska maffiafamiljen Corleone, ledd av Vito don Corleone. Inledningen av den hÃ¤r filmen utspelar sig inne pÃ¥ gudfadern, Vito don Corleones kontor (spelad av Marlon Brando) dÃ¤r han fÃ¶r en dialog med en vÃ¤n, en begravningsentreprenÃ¶r. Efter inledningen av filmen har man fÃ¥tt en ganska klar uppfattning om vilken stor person som gudfadern Ã¤r. SÃ¤ttet han pratar pÃ¥, rÃ¶r sig pÃ¥ och framfÃ¶r allt den respekt han omges av. HÃ¤r stÃ¤mmer det verkligen Ã¶verens med modellen dÃ¥ man gÃ¤rna vill sitta kvar efter anslaget och se hur det gÃ¥r fÃ¶r honom, huvudpersonen. Samtidigt som denna scen utspelas har Corleones slÃ¤kten samlats tillsammans med sina vÃ¤nner hos don fÃ¶r att fira hans dotters brÃ¶llop. HÃ¤r skulle jag sÃ¤ga Ã¤r filmens presentation av de andra karaktÃ¤rerna. Ãr man riktigt med kan man ocksÃ¥ fÃ¥ fram lite av deras relation till don Corleone. En av Corleones sÃ¶ner, Michael Corleone (spelad av en ung Al Pacino) kan man fÃ¶rstÃ¥ Ã¤r en av de nÃ¤rmaste personerna till don. NÃ¥got som man skulle fÃ¥ bekrÃ¤ftat senare i filmen. Han tillhÃ¶r ocksÃ¥ en av de fÃ¥ runt don Corleone som inte vill kÃ¤nnas vid den organiserade brottsligheten. Hela inledningen utgÃ¶rs av parallellhandling dÃ¥ man skiftar mellan att visa gudafaderns samtal med sina sÃ¶ner och gÃ¤ster pÃ¥ kontoret med att visa brÃ¶llopsfesten utanfÃ¶r. Detta gÃ¶r man mycket snyggt. Genom dialoger fÃ¥r man reda pÃ¥ mer om huvudpersonen och som sagt relationerna. Ett exempel pÃ¥ det Ã¤r Michaels samtal med sin sambo Kay. Medan han berÃ¤ttar om sin pappa fÃ¥r vi tittare reda pÃ¥ mer, detta sker pÃ¥ ett mycket naturligt och genomtÃ¤nkt sÃ¤tt. Med den makt som don Corleone besitter kan han utfÃ¶ra de flesta Ã¥tgÃ¤rder och Ã¤renden fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ sina vÃ¤nner tillfredsstÃ¤llda. Detta skulle man kunna kalla filmens konfliktupptrappning och tar sitt fÃ¶rst steg nÃ¤r fÃ¶rsta 'Ã¤rendet' utfÃ¶rs. En scen som de tillhÃ¶r filmhistoriens mest klassiska Ã¤r ju hÃ¤sthuvudet som man hÃ¤r stiftar bekantskap med. Denna hÃ¤ndelse sÃ¤tter lite av prÃ¤geln till vad som hÃ¤nder i fortsÃ¤ttningen av filmen. Konflikterna i filmen trappas upp betydligt nÃ¤r de andra maffiafamiljerna i New York erbjuder Corleone att ansluta sig till narkotikabranschen och han tackar nej, bryter stora komplikationer ut familjerna emellan. FÃ¶ljden av detta Ã¤r att en nÃ¤ra vÃ¤n till familjen, Luca Brasi, blir mÃ¶rdad. Detta tillsammans med att Tom Hagen(i mitt tycke utmÃ¤rkt spelat av Robert Duvall), son till don, blir utfrÃ¥gad av Tattaglia- familjen Corleone, nÃ¤mligen Tattaglia-familjen. Filmen kryllar av smÃ¥ planteringar, vissa tydligare Ã¤n andra. En tydlig plantering Ã¤r ju begravningsentreprenÃ¶ren som Ã¥terkommer senare fÃ¶r att gÃ¶ra sin utlovade gentjÃ¤nst till gudfadern. En kanske inte lika tydlig plantering Ã¤r att bÃ¥da gÃ¥ngerna som Don Corleone Ã¤r nÃ¤ra att dÃ¶, andra gÃ¥ngen dÃ¶r han visserligen sÃ¥ Ã¤r det i samband med att han hÃ¥ller pÃ¥ med frukt. Det kanske inte var meningen av Francis ford Coppola, men jag lade mÃ¤rke till det. FÃ¶rsta gÃ¥ngen blir han skjuten av nÃ¥gra mÃ¤n tjÃ¤nstgÃ¶rande fÃ¶r Tattaglias familj nÃ¤r han stÃ¥r vid ett fruktstÃ¥nd. Andra gÃ¥ngen dÃ¥ han dÃ¶r leker han med barnbarnet i trÃ¤dgÃ¥rden med apelsin i munnen. TillfÃ¤llighet eller inte? Jag lade i alla fall mÃ¤rke till det och jag tvivlar pÃ¥ att Coppola inte hade nÃ¥gon tanke pÃ¥ det nÃ¤r han gjorde. En sak som jag tycker Ã¤r vÃ¤ldigt fascinerande med den hÃ¤r filmen Ã¤r att man stÃ¤ndigt kastas mellan det grova gangstervÃ¥ldet och den erkÃ¤nt goda sammanhÃ¥llningen i familjen. En parallellhandling som genomsyrar hela filmen. Det Ã¤r just denna balans som jag tycker Francis Ford Coppola lyckats till 100 med.",positive

Is there a rating above five stars?,positive
"A significant achievement in conception and execution. The story of a criminal family as a microcosm of the American Dream, turned rotten. It's one of the darkest movies ever - literally. When the film moves from the shadows to the light, you have to squint your eyes. The film has an operatic air and achieves a sense of grandeur that only Visconti in his prime could rival. The performances are imposing in stature. Brando gives his character a sense of dignity that makes his malevolence, and the transformation in Pacino's character is achieved by a hollowing out of his soul. He seems empty and trapped at the end. An influential movie in so many ways.",positive
Amazing THE best movie i have ever seen. If you haven't seen it WHY???,positive
Perfect in every way,positive
"Possibly the most perfect movie made since Casablanca. Aside from the sequel, it has yet to be matched.",positive

Marlon Brando and Al Pacino at their best....,positive
"Awesome directing, acting, music. Complicated plot. Multiple viewing reveals deeper levels.",positive
brando puts in the best piece of acting i have ever witnessed,positive
Real Mafia portrayed at it's best. Viva Italia! You make Greeks look like a bunch of sissy girls. This movie is the truth of all mafia movies so much so that everything else is wack (no pun intended). Marlon Brando thank you for supporting Native Americans and our survival!,positive
An incredible and accurate movie of the book.,positive
So I finally got around to seeing this well known film and I wasn't disappointed. Marlon Brando attracts such a charisma on screen. I can't imagine the second without him. Opening shot was a classic. Excellent.,positive
I like this movie because the mafia way of life in the 40's and the horse's head in some guy's bed scared the shit out of me.,positive
"Another proof of the fact that you don't necessarily need a large budget to make a superb film. Highly detailed, awesome atmosphere which makes you want to join your family for a pasta.",positive

NOTHING BEATS THE GODFATHER !,positive
"Most movie reviews are opinions, but I don't think this one is debatable. Everything about this movie (script, acting, directing, music) works so coherently that no other film in history has been able to match it.",positive
A very good movie but not a great one. There's too much sentimentality in The Godfather: it's in the portrayal of Vito Corleone and the depiction of mob life.,negative
Another five on it! Who doesn't love this?,positive
All the great one-liners in one phenomenal film.,positive

It can be watched over and over again, and still it's as good as 1st time.",positive
My favorite movie of all time. I always make it a point to watch this movie every time I'm on an extended break.,positive
AMAZING MOVIE!! One of Coppola's best. I thought Michael (Pacino) was a hottie. But I didn't like the fact that he left his blonde chick for an Italian chick. I'm not racist but he shoulda stayed with the blonde. Its just I think that he shoulda stayed with her because he was gonna marry her & then he marries some other chick who dies cuz her car blows up. But if you wanna watch a good mafioso movie this definetly takes the cake.,positive
Stellar cast and splendid characterization made this a must watch for all.,positive

"El clÃ¡sico que iniciara la trilogÃ­a sobre la Familia Corleone y sus andanzas por el mundo norteamericano del hampa es, ademÃ¡s, el mejor ejemplo del soberbio manejo actoral del que es posible Coppola como director. La historia se centra en los Ãºltimos dÃ­as de reinado de Vito Corleone al frente de su familia y el advenimiento del benjamÃ­n, Michael, como digno heredero del poder de la Mafia Ã­taloamericana de mitad del siglo XX. El gran acierto de Coppola es la postura que toma para abordar la historia: de forma introspectiva, el cineasta nos adentra en los entretelones del bajo mundo y el crimen organizado, tomando a la instituciÃ³n social de la familia âel nÃºcleo de toda sociedad- como analogÃ­a del mundo criminal. La cinta es un clÃ¡sico por todos sus aciertos pero principalmente es recordada por la sutileza de su dramaturgia y la insuperable actuaciÃ³n de todo su elenco, empezando por los maestros Marlon Brando y Al Pacino.",positive

The beginning of a fantastic 2-movie story (just pretend there was no GF3 and put it in the box where you stashed Matrix 2 and 3).,positive
Good Mafia movie...the movie drags you in as it goes..Alpacino was good,positive
Coppolla and Brando at their best,positive

"I read some schmuck's review about how it's overrated and she fell asleep. One of her statements was ""I'm trying to figure out words to describe it, but I can't."" Well, I don't know, but I guess I'd just say that it's beautiful and aptly constructed and elegantly delivered. *shrug* Perfect in every way, basically.",positive
Best movie ever made,positive
"luchshe etogo fima, i etoi istorii..poka eshe ne smotrela i ne chitala,",positive

"Amazing Film, classic, outstanding performances from all the cast",positive
amazing film one of the greatest ever made,positive
the famous comeback :-) Love Don Corleone,positive
Keren abits...must seen movie dah,positive
"inspiring. If you have any kind of question that needs to be answered, watch the damn movie and you'll find your answer. This is damn poetry. Don Corleone is the prototype of the man how it was meant to be in God's blueprints.",positive
"This movie was filmed in 40 days. The producers threatened to pull the plug on the young director Francis Ford Coppola. We should be thankful that they did not. Else, we would have another movie that Hollywood destroyed.",positive
Klassiker som aldri falmer. Kan ses igjen og igjen.,positive

Bloody brilliant is all I can say about this enduring classic!!!!,positive

"its godfather, 'nuff said",positive
"Quite simply, unsurpassable",positive
My favorite movie. I love this movie.. It was great :)),positive
"A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man. A movie enthusiast who doesn't spend time with this masterwork should sleep with the fishes, posthaste. It's as good as you think it is and then some.",positive
"Fuera de que sea una pelicula de mafia, las leyes que aplican son geniales, si todo el mundo las siguiera, seriamos mejores, la amistad, lealtad y astucia son las mejores cualidades que un ser humano puede tener me gusto mas la segunda parte, siempre tienes obstaculos y siempre hay que poder sobrepasarlos con porte y muchos webos :P",positive
"This movie has everything, means everything.. and Marlon Brando is just fantastic...",positive
"""Leave the gun, take the cannolis."" One of the greatest American movies ever made.",positive
A really great classic and deserving of all the critical acclaim it received. Why can't Hollywood make movies like this any more?,positive

dont mess with the family,positive
I ignored this movie for 27 years.I thought it was too much hype on it and everone was exaggerating Marlon Brando.But I was wrong!!!,positive
This movie made me a deal i could not refuse,positive
"Very controlled, composed film with very strong performances by, of course, Brando as well as Duvall and a young Pacino. And that haunting score is unforgettable.",positive
Favorite Movie Of All Time,positive
"How can sum this movie up? The end result of hard work, major planning, and a creative epiphany. There's more substance in this movie than the majority of movies existing.",positive
Sonny: What the hell is this? Clemenza: It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes,positive
Best movie of all time,positive
"Fabulous. Everyone does an outstanding job. I really need to see this movie again, all the way through.",positive
"If there ever was a true Mob movie this is it. Need I say more... Marlon Brando, Al Pacino... 5 stars all the way.",positive
"If any italian sees this and doesn't like it, then they are no italian at all because this is probably the greatest movie of all time",positive
"A masterpiece of cinema, this movie looks as great, and stuns the viewer. Perhaps the greatest build up to a climax ever done on film. Al Pacino is riveting as Michael.",positive
you are dead to me! great movie! love it!,positive
"Maybe it would sound Machiavellic, but every politician shoud learn from Mr Corleone :)",positive
"""I'm gonna give him an offer you cannot refuse"". A masterpiece on screen. My favorite film. Watch it.",positive
"Masterpiece! One of the greatest films of all time. So many people have tried to match this movie with their crime dramas, but can't. The Godfather isn't a crime drama, it's not about sex or violence, it's about honor, family, and how power can manipulate anyone. Brando and Pacino are incredible. This film is just amazing.",positive
5 stars and 100 more! :P,positive
THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!,positive
OVER-RATED!!!!!!!!!!!,negative
"If anybody does not like this movie, they don't deserve to live.",positive

commenti baraye behtarin filme tarikhe cinema!,positive
"Coppola, Brando, Pacino and Puzo itÂ´s magic.",positive
The cast is out of this world! the best movie ever made you can get a million quotes from the dialogues not to mention the wisdom of the Godfather. A masterpiece anyday!,positive
The greatest movie of all time.,positive
"If you aint seen this, you smokin rocks. Lol",positive
Too lengthy but best film made relating to real life crime. A lot of others are budget films.,negative
Most Favorite of all 3,positive
"One of the greatest films ever. If you have not done it yet, check out the book !!!",positive
Underbart skÃ¥despel; fantastiskt driven berÃ¤ttelse; spÃ¤nnande (men vÃ¤l otÃ¤ck) och underhÃ¥llande.,positive
The whole trilogy is worth of watching but the first one is still the best.,positive
The best movie in the world ?!,positive
"The most fantastic gangster movie ever, if you have not seen it you should be asking yourself WHY!",positive
"Gudfadern Ã¤r och fÃ¶rblir den bÃ¤sta mafia-filmen som gjorts. Till dom som inte sett den sÃ¤ger jag bara: Se den, cause itÂ´s an offer you canÂ´t refuse!",positive
una oferta que no podrÃ¡ rechazar,positive
An amazingly well directed film. The resulting performances visible by these actors are probably the most realistic I have ever seen.,positive
it is the best movie Ä± have ever seen,positive
What can I possibly say? It's the Godfather.,positive
Classic must see mob movie...,positive
"Not only one of the best done and most well known mob movies, it also has by far one of the most interesting stories of how it was produced.",positive
Brilliant...but not as good as the sequel.,positive
"I hate this movie. Yeah the direction was amazing, but the plot was predictable. Relied too much on visual violence.",negative
"The only gd, Godfather!",positive
First time I watched it in its entirety. Can't wait to see the others.,positive
"Enough as been already said about this movie, including the hot debate one whether this, or its fantastic sequel is better. As tight a race as it is, when the film develops, the original beats Part II by a nose.",positive
unbelievable performance by brando,positive
in a simply words this movie is Like No Other,positive
An look into the mafia that you will never forget.,positive
Great ganster flick. Marlon Brando is amazing.,positive
"Oh yes, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are amazing.",positive
One of the best movies of all time & the best gangster movie ever.,positive
What more can i say!?,positive
A bit dated. Only saw it recently and it appeared cliched because of everything that had copied it since. Enjoyable and well acted.,positive
Extremely well made movie.,positive
In my opinion it is the best godfather movie,positive
"A great film, epic is not the word. A real tour de force in acting.",positive
"One of the best, all-time!",positive
"It took me until now to get aquainted with this classic. And it was good, but I felt that it left some things unexplained. Great sound track.",negative
One of my all time favorites.,positive
This film is just amazing. Everything about it is just brilliant,positive
The best gangster movie ever...,positive
O'kay I agree The Godfather was great but watching for over 3 hours in a 16 hour plane flight isn't fun.,negative
The best of the best.,positive
how can you not like this?,positive
"""I 'll make him an offer he can't refuse..""",positive
Three words: ALL TIME CLASSIC.,positive
the greatest movie epic ever made ur not a real man till uve watched the godfather collection...i live my life by its rules,positive
"This movie is simply amazing. It held my attention the entire way through the almsot three hours. Incredibly directed, well thought out and acted",positive
What can I say this movie is one of the greats it does not beat part 2 or citizen cane tho but it is in my top 5,positive
Brilliant. That's all I can really say. The acting is superb,positive
"Still great to this day, not like it was going to diminish anytime soon.",positive
I can watch this over and over. A classic.,positive
Can some one ask Andy Garcia for IV?,positive
A movie nobody can refuse. But Goodfellas is better.,positive
"If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.",positive
"Someday - and that day may never come - I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this justice as gift on my daughter's wedding day.",positive
This movie is the best mafia film ever !,positive
made me want to be in the mafia.,positive
UN CLÃSICO. MARLON BRANDO ES TREMENDO.,positive
"The best movie of all time, absolutely perfect!!",positive
"best movie even to this day nothing comes close to the suspense, the music , the twist",positive
There are no words about the Corleone family,positive
This movie is a staple. 'nuf said,positive
perfect example of when a movie with perfect parts becomes just that... perfect.,positive
"Coppola directs what many regard as the greatest film of all time. Brando is amazing as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino makes Michael his own and James Caan is one hardcore S.O.B. as Sonny. You don't know cinema if you haven't seen this film",positive
The greatest movie ever....Francis Ford Copolla created a masterpiece in films with an astonishing directing...fantastic plot...and with two sequels just amazing...the only movie in cinematography where all three parts are just perfect...,positive
my fav gangstar movie to date. A true classic. Pacino and Brando really deliver some of their best preformances.,positive
"Many claim that Godfather II surpassed the original. I guess I never have agreed with that. To me, this is the closest to flawless filmaking as it gets.",positive
"Just for the sake of seeing Brando's and Pacino's performance it must be watched. This movie, with its complicated and surprising plot and great dialogues,is fascinating. And of course its soundtrack has become an unforgettable classic.",positive
one of the all time great movies,positive
I didn't get this movie when I was a kid. I watched it as an adult and it deserves its reputation as one of the greatest movies of all time. Amazing redemption- gangster-disillusionment plot.,positive
"An expertly-crafted adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel, with daring performances and unforgettable imagery. A true classic.",positive
Pacino and Brando brought together by Coppola. 5 or nothing.,positive
"Not my kind of movie, but it wasn't too bad.",negative

"Probably the best movie ever made, definitely in the top five",positive
"The best film ever, better than the second cos Brando is in it!",positive
"I wonder if I could talk the same way with cotton balls in my mouth. If I started a frat at my age I would be the Godfather. So kiss my hand. Oh yeah, great movie, could have used more blood.",positive
"one of the best movies ever,actually i liked godfather2 better",positive
"Nothing can beat this.This movie is real Havoc(Tka a bet).classic to the core.Superb performance by Marlon,Al P And good piece of direction.",positive
Everything is in there!,positive
just watched this again. the DON of mafia movies.,positive
"Excellent film, one the best gangster films ever. Brando and Pacino are awesome.",positive
"Best movie ever. As close as perfection comes to film, everything about it is amazing, from the acting to the amazing plot. good god.",positive
FF Copolla's flawless film is undoubtably a classic with both Pacino and Brando giving some powerful performances. The sequel may be superior but The Godfather is still a classic on its own.,positive
"Far too good, watch it over and over again, and thank Francis Ford Copalla for his creative genius.",positive
"If u don't see it, it is yr loss.",positive
"on niin aidon tuntuinen kuvaus, ettÃ¤ tuntuu kuin olisi itse osa perhettÃ¤. Si!",positive
"A great film!! It contains a lot of plots, such as anger, jealousy, love, justice, hate...etc. I watched it over 5 times....",positive
Se puede decir algo el respecto??? Simplemente un obra maestra.,positive
"efsane serinin ilk filmi, mutlaka izlenmesi gerek",positive
so freaken scary at the beginning,negative
I could watch it over and over again. Too bad part III was such a disappointment.,positive
The best movies of all time ! The cast were fantastic.,positive
To be a man is not just about being a man. It's all about family,positive
bÃ¤sta filmerna nÃ¥gonsin,positive
In my humble opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made and the best of all three. While the second one feels like a more complete film it lacks one critical element named Marlon Brando,positive
Gad DAMN this is some top drawer shit!,positive
The greatest movie of the world!!!,positive
Magnifique. Vu en 2007 pour moi. Super. Les premiers pas d'Al Pacino chez les Corleone,positive
The best gangster movie of all time get it in your dvd collection,positive
"ONe of the best cinematic masterpieces of the modern ages. Coppola shows his cinematic genius at both amazing script writing and glorius cinematography. This will survive forever as one of the greats, up on the great shelf of masterpieces with Laurence of Arabia and Gone with the Wind.",positive
all time favorite mob movie thats all there is to say,positive
a true life of mafia....,positive
...parla piu piano che nessuno sentira....,positive
"This was one of the best movies of all time. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and the rest of the cast were fantastic. This is one of the most memorable movies Hollywood has ever made.",positive
Probably the best movie ever. Great book too.,positive
"This isn't so much a movie about the mob as it is a movie about a family. And no, I don't mean a crime ""family""; I mean, the actual, literal Corleone family themselves. The individual relationships are explored fantastically, and the effects of this family' brightest son's slow, unwilling descent to the dark side while trying to go legit is haunting.",positive
"AMAZING acting! lighting, shot composition, writing!! I believe so much in the characters!",positive
"BRANDO, ERES GRANDE, MIS RESPETOS",positive
Brando and Pacino at their best!,positive
i make you a offer you can't reffuse,positive
really long. i must be the only person NOT giving it 5 stars :/ i just cant get into gangsta flicks.,negative
"Contains some of the most amazing sequences in film history. The story doesn't have the same mindblowing arc as the second one, but it makes up for it with James Caan, who is awesome always.",positive
This movie has everything you look for in a mafia movie.,positive
"I can't say anything about this film that hasn't already been said. All I can say is, believe everything you hear about it. You haven't seen a move until you've seen this one. There's nothing else like it.",positive
"My favorite movie of all time. Anything I could say has already been said, but it's the one movie that I could watch over and over and learn something new about it each time. Classic...",positive
good classic stuff...the older ones are better...,positive
Simply wonderful movie making... This movie never bores you coz you can feel the power of marlon brando's screen presence and the way he portrays the lead role..... marvellous acting...and the movie does good justice to the book...,positive
Ummm... Totalment. The best movie about Italian Mobsters ever.,positive
Classic... what more can i say,positive
Greatest movie of all time.,positive
One of the best gangsta films of all time.,negative
"The movie that all mobster movies try to grab the coat tails of. Brando gives one of his most memorable roles and Pacino is great like he always was back then (Now he's a shrively old shell of his former self.) The best part of this movie is Caan's charector, Sonny.",positive
I want to be in the family.,positive
"Epic. This makes three-hour car rides nothing, riding with the Don does that. Seeing Al Pacino so young kinda unnerved me (in a good way), but Marlon Brando was equally rocking.",positive
"Outstanding, relevant depth of characters. Testosterone-injected screenplay, directed with a theatre twist. Fascinating, relevant storyline addressing power conflict, family relations, and the basics of human nature. Brilliant.",positive
"The best movie ever, and my favorite",positive
"perfection. exqusite storytelling, acting, cinematography and music. can't watch it often enough...",positive
classic! one of my fave books and movies of all time.,positive
It's a legend movie with lots of legend actors.,positive
"Absolutely frickin amazing. I watched it a two times in a row. The story flows like none I have ever seen..........Next to the Aviator. Great cast, amazing score, and supporting cast. It doesn't get any better.",positive
"Classic, not much more i can say. Tells a great story about organized crime within the Mafia. Marlon Brando a true master and well deserved of the title of the 'Don'. Throw in Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan and u got one hell of a movie. Watch it!",positive
"changed cinema as we know it and i love how they create such empathy for ""bad"" asses!",positive
dont fuck wit da family,positive
The Italian Mob hand book,positive
Even after I heard about it anf got hyped up...frickin amazing!,positive

always makes me want to eat pasta...,positive
"if you are a crime movie fan and havent seen this then you dont deserve to live, absolutely classic",positive
Make him an offer he cannot refuse. Classic in every way.,positive

The end-all to awesome movies!,positive
wow quel classique memorable ne jamais oublier la famille corleone,positive

something you shouldn't watch just once.,positive

"The epic you must see, the art of the gangster movies",positive
i grew up on this movie. it is so amazing i can't even begin to describe it.,positive
Excellent movie about the factors that cause a good man to become inherently evil....This movie really is worthy of the praise it's gotten over the past 35-40 years.,positive
close to perfect with so much style,positive

the best gangster film of all time,positive
"The Godfather is no doubt one of the top five or six greatest films ever made, and I'm sure it's legacy will only grow with time. The acting is superb, the direction unrivaled.",positive
Quite simply the best movie of all time. Ever. Nothing else needs to be said. Watch it.,positive
"Not only a great movie, but also an excellent book. Coppola really showed that a gangster film does not need to be all about the shootings. Let's just hope nobody tries to make a remake.",positive
Do I even need to say anything? As good as Mob flicks get!!,positive
"Full credit to Puzo for a great story and to Coppola for a brilliantly made picture, but hatâs off to Brando who just nailed it from the 1st scene to the last & proved why he was one of Hollywoods finest.",positive
Because it is so great!,positive
"If you tell me its too long to watch, i will hurt you.",positive
Cannot argue...This movie is in the top 10 of all time,positive
classic story of the mob! quite great,negative
"Words to live by: Leave the gun, take the cannolis",positive
"Who can not say that they have neither been intrigued by the dealings of teh mafi or have not enjoyed this movie. It was the first big budget insight into such and lead the way for many more, and sometimes better movies of its genre. I loved it.",positive
True Epic! The best movie ever made. Period. You could analyse each scene for a century and still get value every time you watch it.,positive
Idoit if you have not seen it,positive
the whole trilogy was a classic.....,positive
The greatest saga of all! Little to choose between Pacino and Brando with Duvall and Caan as good as ever. I am yet to see a better example of great picturization of a bestseller. All characters look exactly what you would imagine in the book!,positive
"Out of the first two Godfather movies, I prefer this one. Just great.",positive
"the beat gang related film out there not to mention ""leave the gun, take the cannolis""",positive

"Coppola's films are always too long and over-the-top, but this should not take away from a beautifully made, acted and filmed movie, which has to be watched.

"Love, Love, love - I've seen it too many times to count - a true classic of american cinema",positive

By far the best of the triology,positive
Classic no one can grow up WITHOUT seeing this movie. The lines are unforgettable and Marlon Brando is unforgettable when we call Brando the best actor of the century it is becasue of this movie,positive

The best script ever,positive
Serious contender for best film ever made.,positive
"I don't wanna sleep with the fishes, although I know the real mafia had some influence on this then herd mentality started to take over and make people hail it as great. Think about it. When social proof says that a movie is great even though let's say you play it in an alternate universe where nobody says it's great, you will start to find some qualities about it that makes you think it's great. But really, it's just a decent movie. That's all.",negative

"The Godfather of Gang's Movie!! Brando mixed horror, blessing, power, loyalty, violence, to play the Corleone Emperor. Its influence on gang's movie is signaficant. The ""puppet icon"" and music is classic!",positive
The Greatest Movie of All Time,positive
"wow, powerfull story of family and the pitfalls of power.",positive
This movie is indescribable. The Best! You have to watch it.,positive
"THE BEST MAFIA MOVIE, after II",positive
"IN FILMMAKING, THERE IS AN AFTER AND BEFORE ""THE GODFATHER""",positive
Literally the perfect movie.,positive
"well i paid more attention this time to the reasons why mike gets into his fathers business after being adament that he wasnt like him and would never live the life. well... the attempted murder of his dad and then him having to protect his dad alone against all odds, the attempt on his life with his wife getting killed instead of him. his brother getting assassinated. its a dog eat dog world...the ruthless mike you see later on is justified. as for brando's performance, he's simply amazing. ""[seeing Sonny in the mortuary] Look how they massacred my boy"". thats just one of the quotes there...tons more where that came from.",positive

"omg! masterpiece! one of the best films of all time, acting, music, directing is so amazing and will be remember years from now, hopefully i can do a movie like that one day",positive
When I first saw this film I was absolutely chocked by the brutality in it. It is nothing in comparison to the brutality of films created nowadays. Still the classical and only godfatherfilm- the best!,positive
It is as perfect as the third installment was flawed.,positive
my #1 fav of all time,positive
dont watch the other two . Just stop at this one.,positive
A wonderfull adaptation of an excellent novel. Thanks to puzo and coppola.,positive
Takes a long time to get going but is worth it...gripping!,positive
Want to understand politics/business? Or just how a family woks? Go and watch it immediately!,positive
"Just to give an idea how much this film meant to me (and my family), the first grandkid in our family was named Vito, yes, after Vito Andolini of corleone.. Words cannot express how amazing the film is.",positive
Unbelievable - One of the best movies ever made!,positive
i`ll make you an offer you cant refuse...,positive
"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" Is there any better?",positive
"Absolutely perfect. If a movie ever came close to perfection it is this movie. The cast is perfect, the music is perfect, the script is perfect, the story is both suspensful and deep. Brando's performance is possibly his finest. It is all around the greatest movie ever made. This movies says the most about America, what we value, where we've come from, and who our heroes are. It is a great combination of villians and heroes, of art and rollercoaster.",positive
"A classic, albeit a bit too violent for me taste.",positive
"The best movie ever made...ever...a masterpiece of cinema all around, this work of art beautifully captures the brutality as well as the raw power of the Mafia in the 20th century in New York City. From top to bottom, frame to frame, even minor characters paint a portrait of the Mafia not just as a shoot-em-up ragtag group of gangsters but as human beings with real families and by the time you're through with it it leaves you almost sympathetic to the struggle of the Corleone Family...""Leave the gun, take the cannoli.""",positive
"A masterpiece, a classic symbol in movie history!!! No more comments...",positive
saya harus kasih rate 5 biji bintang walaupun gak suka acara potong kepala kuda. nggak enak ama sodara jauh di pelosok emilia-romagna.,positive

Gots to be a 5 star for both of these earlier GF's - fab acting and gorgeous Pacino - got to love this mobster dramatics - I could have done the whole pearls and tight-lipped thang and hung off some gangster's arm! Love it!,positive
The best of the three Godfather movies. Marlon Brando is fantastic. He is the reason why this one is the best.,positive
"ViihdyttÃ¤vÃ¤ ja koskettava tarina mafiaperheestÃ¤. Brando vetÃ¤Ã¤ tunteella pumpulit poskissa ja Al Pacino tekee debyyttinsÃ¤ Michaelina, jonka tÃ¤ytyy astua perheen pÃ¤Ã¤ksi.",positive
"Great film, well directed, well shot, possibly the greatest film ever? No The Godfather II is........",positive

"I renounce satan, aaaahhh so f**kin cool",positive
"Brilliant, hard to choose between 1 and 2.",positive
"I thought this movie was made a lot longer ago than when it really was made, and even though I had seen a snippet from the third film where Al Pacino plays the Mafia boss, I didn't put two and two together. That aside, I thought this movie was a solid story. How can you not though? It's a classic! And why is that you ask? Well, I believe it's because they did not rush the film through just to get to the action, since most movies are not completely dependent on action to be solid, and because they took their time telling the story, there was room for all sorts of subplots, different times and ways to tap into the emotions of the audience. . . It's what movies should be like nowadays but many times fail at doing.",positive
i am gonna make him an offer that he can not refuse,positive
Greatest movie ever made,positive
"Beautiful epic movie, just fantastic in all aspects.",positive

"Great classic movie. Can be a little boring in parts, but overall, it really is the masterpiece it is made out to be.",positive
Greatest movie ever made,positive
"Every time I watch this film I understand more and more why it is as highly regarded as it is. Coppolla does a fantastic job of weaving several characters storylines together without any confusion. Michael's change is so interesting to watch. The cinematography is amazing as well, particularly the lighting on the characters as they talk. Lots of shadows. Great stuff. I think GoodFellas barely edges out the film, but this is no doubt a masterpiece.",positive
I was astounded the first time I saw this. Probably the greatest movie ever made,positive
"oh, i mean this is my favourite of the godfather films!!",positive

All stories- one after another. A great movie night!,positive

"It wasn't as great as everyone hyped it to be, it was good, but very slow moving. The best part had to be the last 15 minutes and i didn't really care for the film. The cast was great and the acting was oustanding however.",negative

Probably one of the best movies ever made,positive
"Kind of long and slow, but a great movie if you can make it through.",positive

Gripped from beginning to end. An annual must on my video list.,positive
"""The Godfather"" es la mejor película en la historia del cine (lo siento, Orson. ""Citizen Kane"" me parece fría, demasiado perfecta). Ninguna película ha podido o podrá acercase a la genialidad de la obra del director Francis Ford Coppola acerca de una ""familia"" conocida como los Corleone. Esto es arte de primer nivel: la fotografía de Gordon Willis es perfecta, la edición magistral, el guión de Mario Puzo es preciso y punzante, la música de Nino Rota es clásica. Y ni hablar de las actuaciones perfectas de Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale y Steling Hayden. Si usted es amante del cine, ""The Godfather"" es una oferta que no puede (ni debe) rehusar.",positive
This may be the best film ever made. This is a flawless telling of the Sicilian code and mafia. So many lines can be quotes from this movie. It is certainly the ultimate guy's movie.,positive

"Marlon Brando.........legend............al Pacino........legendary! What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day.

"An intriguing look at the saga of a family embedded in the Mafia. Has one of the best character arcs in cinema as the young Michael Corleone, a timid war veteran who wants nothing to do with his father's business, transforms into a ruthless crime lord more deadly than his father ever was.",positive
Umm hello Im Italian... I love this movie,positive
"Believe it or not, this is not my favorite Coppola movie. I prefer some of his other works such as ""The Conversation"" or "" Apocalypse Now"". However, ""The Godfather"" remains a monumental film in the gangster genre and the importance it has made in our culture doesn't need to be ignored. Do I think it is the greatest gangster film made? Not really, I've seen better but the depth, scope, and vision is one that stands out among the rest and the cinematography and tightness of the script leaves it a monumental force of cinema. Still, is it better than ""Citizen Kane""? No, and no matter how many years it is voted, it will never surpass Orson Welles' tour de force of American innovation.",positive
Best Movie of all time. Period!,positive
"If you haven't seen this movie, we can't be friends.",positive
"One of the best movies ever! Part two is equally as good, but part three is sorta crap.",positive
"The gold standard for gangster / Mafia movies, as does not rely on violence and blood to make it's point. Family is all, however it can lead you to the ""dark side"" (Michael), and causes lifelong angst fo those on periphery. Sonny great charachter, and Brando stellar, but some of the best performances you nearly miss, i.e. Luca Brazzi as a quiet but very scary killer, who will give up anything for his ""family"", which it isn't. So compelling it survives multiple viewings,w hich has to be the acid test of greatness",positive
"Amazing story by Puzo, perfectly acted by Pacino and Brando. More than a crime show it speaks to the American Dream itself.",positive

the third greatest film in american cinematic history( the three parts are great),positive
Best film ever made in this genre.,positive
Everone likes the sequel better and hates the third but I prefer this for 2 reasons: Brando is magnificant; and it sets the scene perfectly. You wouldn't care about Vito's history if he hadn't been so well depicted.,positive

Well made and well acted from all actors.,positive
One of the best movies of all time. Perfection.,positive
"""The Godfather"" is much, much more than a great film - it's a legendary film, regarded by thousands as the greatest ever made. And its continual reign at the top of the IMDb.com top 250 proves this. There have been so many reviews written about this movie and its subsequent sequels, so much written about it - not only here on this website but in magazines, books, universities, the whole caboodle - that someone like me has to be careful that their review doesn't go over too much old ground and become boring. Unfortunately, to a large extent, ""The Godfather"" is famous for people being unanimous about what makes it so good and so I will probably have to repeat what countless others have said. Certainly one can not fault the story itself - a magnificent tale of life in the Mafia and, in particular, of the development of the youngest son of Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), Michael (Al Pacino). The screenplay, adapted by Mario Puzo and Coppola from Puzo's own novel, is a breathtaking affair of first-class writing and suspense, and is a fine example of what is sadly missing in many of today's films. The fact that we, as an audience, are drawn into this world by the way in which it takes its time to unravel its many different layers is something that a lot of filmmakers don't consider today. Take, for example, the scenes after the attempted murder on Corleone. The audience are told exactly what is going to happen with Michael's revenge, so that everything will seem plausible when the time comes. Think about it; if we had cut straight to the scene in the restaurant after Michael's announcement that he is going to kill Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) then the fact that Michael finds a gun in the bathroom would seem ridiculous and we would not believe it. It is like this throughout all the film - everything is explained to us, every last piece of information needed to tell us why this thing happens later on in the film, why he dies at this moment. It means that the movie takes its time - the DVD version I have is aprox. 164 minutes long - but in a sense you lose track of time because you are so engrossed in the story. The acting is superb, not just Pacino or Brando, though these two do stand out, but the whole cast, even the extras in Sicily. Again, like every nook of the script, Coppola uses and manipulates every actor's potential to get the performance we deserve as an audience. There's a wonderful scene before the one mentioned earlier where the sons and Tom are discussing what to do next and they're all talking over each other. Utterly believable and excellent. The film is shot beautifully. I'm no expert on this area and I do try to steer clear of it in reviews, but there's no doubt at how gorgeous the whole film looks. The colour is vibrant, and yet the shadows play such an important part in the key scenes. I believe it really reaches its full potential in the scenes in Sicily, truly capturing the beauty of the country, which in turn is transposed to the beauty of Appollina. There are one or two flaws - after all, there has never been and never will be an utterly perfect film, despite what some people say - which are also, ironically, perfectly plausible. The female characters are weak and although this is obviously demonstrating the role of the woman in the Mafian society, Diane Keaton's character could have been stronger. Also, although wonderfully written, the script does need paying attention to, otherwise you are going to find yourself lost in a maze of Italian names. What you cannot argue against, however, is the violence. Yes, ""The Godfather"" is a violent film, but the great thing about this violence is that Coppola only uses it WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. Unlike many films today, the violence in this movie is essential to the plot, to keep it driving on and also to give us a fantastic character study of Michael, particularly towards the end of the movie. Enough's being said; if you haven't seen this movie you HAVE to see it, just to see what all the fuss is about. That's what I did, and it turned out all right for me. I mean, I haven't found a horse's head in my bed....yet.",positive

"I still tend to like the book better because it had so much more detail. I supposed almost 3 hours is pushing it, but films do have less time to work with. What a pity - they should make a televised series. And as brilliant as this was, I still have a problem with Brando's accent. Come on! And end shot? Genius.",positive
"Better than the book by a mile, although the book does offer some insight into the characters. Worth seeing, a classic since its inception.",positive
"It's a classic, go see it now. It is the movie to end all movies.",positive

Your life is incomplete if you haven't seen this. Basically you would be the equivalent of a virgin.,positive
amazing.... al pacino is beautiful,positive
"this movie is a legend, you have to see it!",positive
"Can this movie be over-hyped? No, I watched the Godfather all readied to be underwhelmed after all the great reviews, but instead was swept up by the great story telling and Brando's amazing acting. A word of advise - Don't read the book, it's a total disappointment.",positive

It's very diffucult to make a great movie accorrding to a great book. The Godfather movie is one of few examples out there that it's possible. It's pleasure to watch it again and again.,positive
Al Pacino is really great in this movie.,positive
"Finally managed to see part one of the Godfather trilogy and must admit, they knew how to make movies then! Character movies that is! Mind you, with a cast including Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, even Marlon Brando - I guess, you cannot get far wrong, particularly under the watchful eye of a director of the calibre of Francis Ford Coppola. A wonderful movie, magnificantly acted and directed and I am glad that my first experience of this feature was on the big screen. Roll on Godfather II - I'll be there!",positive

"A great film, definitely the best one of the trilogy. Beautiful photography you rarely find in films today. The duration of the film adds to the effect of Michael going through a life transition and his inner battle of accepting his ""duty"" as head of family. Slightly a shame though that Coppola 's fame rides on having made the Godfather trilogy.",positive
"Vito Corleone started a criminal empire merely in the begining to get his own family out of poverty. Later on people in the family put power ahead of each other and become corrupted by the power. The moral foundations of the family disappear, slowly selling their souls. What a lesson! What a film!!",positive
Kan se den hur mÃ¥nga gÃ¥nger som helst!,positive
The last great film before Hollywood regressed into adolesence. Godfather stands out in history as the aphex of film making.,positive
"Just a slight overrated, but only a slight. The Godfather is probably not the best movie ever made, but the fact that it is mentioned alongside all the greats should give you an idea of the magnitude of it's greatness. The Godfather is a brilliant portrait of organized crime. Even through the violence, The Godfather has very strong messages of respect and family. Every performance given here is nailed perfectly, especially Pachino's. This is Al Pachino's best work (which is saying something), and watching his transfiguration from an honest veteran to a mob boss is magnificent. The violins in the theme are haunting, and the score is perfect. A must-see not only for moviegoers, but for everybody.",positive

"Alright, I'm going to say it: This is a great film, influtential, yadda yadda yadda... BUT!!! *Deep breath* it's so long, so tangled at points, and Brando (once again) seems to simply walk through his performance playing himself.

Mycket bra film. Ett mÃ¤sterverk som bÃ¶r ses,positive
"All i can say is that ""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse"": vote this trilogy as the best of all times. Simply a masterpiece of all times, to all those dreamers of becoming a filmmaker it is enough with watching ""The Baptism"" scene to know all there is to know about cinema. And to think that Coppola hardly could convince the studio to go with Pacino... some people can see beyond everything!",positive
The best I've ever sine - perfect,positive

The best mob film ever made!Without a doubt.,positive
"I was born in the late 80's, so a heavy, slowmoving classic like this was at first difficult to digest. I realised straight off that the elements were there: Pacino, great dialogue and originality to mention a few. I still can't watch the Godfather from begginning 'till end in one sitting and seldom have time to, but even in small doses this film works. Excellent atmosphere! Again, one of my fav films.",positive
"a move which let me know how charming Marlon Brando is, godfather=Marlon Brando, i guess it'll become a forever""="" .The movie itself is not really exciting but it has a magic to attract u, a chemical reaction of Coppola and Marlon Brando.",positive
A movie that had me gripped from the start..,positive

How can anyone give this less than a 5?,positive
theres very little left 2 say. its the godfather. its basically the perfect movie,positive
"the scene at the end with the baptism and shooting- amazing editing, I liked the dynamicism (is that a word?), - not all it was cracked up to be, I've heard the second one was better - besides Brando pisses me off",negative
"la mejor pelicula de la historia, marlon brando el mejor, increible, priceless",positive

"Does it need a review? Is the godfather, for god's sake !",positive

"What can I say, I'm 1/2 Italian.",positive
It's the Godfather. Love it.,positive
phaaaa....Hela serien Ã¤r ett mÃ¥ste..,positive

A worthy adoption of the novel with true-to-the-book characters. Although I fail to notice what's so superb about Marlon Brando's acting of Vito Corleone that everyone seems to be so enthusiastic about.,positive
Best Mafia Movie Ever,positive

"Classic mafia movie, personal favourite. Lot's of famous scenes and lines that are used. Epic movie!",positive
Theres something about Al Pacino in this that literarly makes me feel hot and weak...,positive
Another one I had to watch for my course and hated,negative
"I just saw this movie for the first time recently, and I must say I blown away, it truly is a great beginning to an epic tale, and the acting was amazing as well. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando did a superb job. I look forward to seeing the other two.",positive
"A definite classic. This is one of few superb films I ever watched. Great acting, direction, cinematography and screenplay.",positive

The title speeks for itself,positive
The Godfather of all mafia flicks......duh....Anyway it was a great movie....the rise to power of Michael Corleone is a great character study and if you watch part 2 and part 3 you will appreciate the plot of part 1 even more...what is there not to love about this movie? ....,positive

One of the best movies of all time,positive
Don Corleone! The Daddy of all mafia movies!,positive
"Theres something striking about how authentic this film looks, you actually believe it is a 1940s gangster film. This film introduced me to the Maifa Genre: Sopranos, Goodfellas, i owe them all to Coppolla",positive
The Godfather is the best gangsta movie eva. Nothin will eva b able to compete wit it.,positive
"terrific! it's not easy to find another movie which has 3 hrs to go and you still found it short. If not Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, the movie will not be that success. After viewing this movie, you certainly would like to spend another 6 hrs to see what happen to this maifa leaders in the rest of his life. And then another 9 hrs, at least, to watch the 3 sequels all over again!",positive
The best movie ever made.,positive
the godfather of all movies,positive
I adore this movie.marlon brando is perfect and it is a very good novel adaptation,positive
It's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Marlon Brando and Al pacino made some excellent work here.,positive
"""Some times you gotta do what you gotta do, for the love of family""",positive
A classic American gangster movie.,positive
"Hadn't watched this one all the way through until recently. Definitely a good story, well acted, brilliantly directed. At times, I couldn't believe it was so old! Clearly certain techniques are classic no matter what.",positive
the best film of all time!!!!,positive
Classic. Can't say much more...,positive
"classic, loved the wedding scene with Johnny Fontaine's song as a backdrop where Al Pacino told Diane Keaton 'That's my family Kate, it's not me.'",positive
"When Sonny died, I was very upset. I was also sad when his wife died. But altogether, an awesome movie.",positive
"Aj dÃ¥, kommer nu fÃ¥ en massa kritik fÃ¶r mitt betygsÃ¤ttning fÃ¶r den hÃ¤r film... Ledsen, tyckte att den var lÃ¥ngtrÃ¥kig och det krÃ¤vs en mycket effektiv Ã¶vertalning att fÃ¥ mig att se den 2:a och 3:e filmerna ocksÃ¥. VarsÃ¥god, det Ã¤r bara att fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka med Ã¶vertalning! ;-)",negative
Epic and hard ass. I loved the contrasts of the family 'business' and family love.,positive
The best. Nothing comes close. (Except Part II which may be even better...),positive
My absolut favorite film.Makes me cry soooo much,positive
"Sicilya, Åarap, mÃ¼zikler. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, daha ne olsun ...",positive
It's The Godfather...what else need be said?,positive
"Amazing drama, legendary actors, glamorized violence, even has boobs, seriously... how can you top that?",positive
As i am too young to catch him i didn't watch too much brando film's but dude this was extremely good. Also the movie made Pachino it was a great pleasure to wacth it and it is normal to see this film in top5 at all rankin charts,positive
classic. who doesn't love this movie?,positive
al pacinonun hayranÄ± olmama sebep olan film. tam bir yÄ±ldÄ±zlar geÃ§idi ve tabi marlon brandoyu don corleone rolÃ¼nde izlemek harika.,positive
"no comment. Brilliant. The only thing I don't like in godfather series is ""Al Pacino"". His acting is exaggerated and overrated by others. He owns this to his character not to his acting in the series. However that does not mean he is a great actor. He has many great actings in the others but sorry not in the godfathers.",positive
"""Un film che non si puÃ² rifiutare""",positive
you can act like a man! (SMACK),positive
Masterpiece... need I say more??,positive

"I love them all, but this is the one that started it",positive
"20th Century Shakespeare. Yeah, you heard that right.",positive
I and II. wiwawowa-- really. awesome.,positive
The best movie ever made,positive
A classic.. what I like about this movie is how Al Pacino came to power. The unexpected happens in our lives when we have to step up at times and Al Pacino did just that... Taking over the family biz and became the head of the Mofia...,positive
"Truly epic, this film is second to maybe only its sequel. Perfectly transitioned from the book into a film, the cast is stunning and all the performances are beyond brilliance. Marlon Brando as the Don is one of the finest castings of all time, and it is possibly his finest role,and the one he will be most remembered for. This is also one of Al Pacino's most famous roles, and would more then likely be second only to his famous role as Tony Montana in Scarface. There are absolutely no flaws in this movie, and it is a must see for anyone that considers themselves a movie fan",positive
Simply the best fim ever,positive
"I just cannot refuse this offer; Pacino, Caan, Brando, Duvall, Cazale, etc. And of course the great story by Mario Puzo.",positive
"It was good, but one of the best movies of all time? Not on my list.",positive
Do I even need to actually tell you why this is good?,positive
The BEST movie in cinema history. A MUST SEE!!!!,positive
great story. it wouldnt have had the same feel if it was remade as it was back then. loved it!,positive
"my all time favorite movie nothing can match this movie, except the second godfather..",positive
Near perfect. A discussion with me regarding this series inevitably turns into a lecture on how the trilogy is a simile for America in the post-WW II international system. Coppola doesn't confirm this in his audio commentary (I've listened to all three) but I know I'm right dammit! Where's Puzo?,positive
How can you not LOVE this movie!,positive
"I'm Italian, and proud of it. It is people like this that make me proud.",positive
"An all time classic, get the trilogy dvd set on watch together.",positive
The best movie ever.,positive
What can you say. A perfect film.,positive
Masterfully done and presented. One of my favorite movies.,positive
"Arguably the greatest film ever. Well written, stunningly acted, impeccably filmed, epic in stature and shadowed perhaps only by its 1974 sequel. Francis Ford Coppolaâs lavish production of the 1969 novel of the same name by Mario Puzo chronicling the life of the Corleone crime family became a benchmark in modern cinema and acted as a launching pad for some of Hollywoodâs now legends, as well being perhaps the most defining performance of veteran Marlon Brando.",positive
"This movie is amazing. Stunning performances by Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton. I could watch this drama over and over and never get tired of it.",positive
Beginning of action...great movie,positive
If an honest man such as yourself should make enemies then they'd become my enemies. then they would fear you. uuuuuuuu mama,positive

so amazing.no review can explain how great this film is from start to finish.,positive
obvious reasons once cast in concideration.,positive
Marlon Brando= supreme awesomness. I'll never forget the look on his face when he stuck that orange peel (or whatever fruit it was) in his teeth and smiled. RIP Marlon.,positive

I even quite liked that hothead Sonny.The story isn't rushed and we are given time to appreciate the motives and tensions that underly these chaotic but seemingly enticing lifestyles.",positive

"Another clichÃ© choice, but once again it is a magnificent film, as are Parts II and III (which is always bashed for no good reason). The rise of the young Michael Corleone in this film is the best story in the trilogy for me.",positive

You had a good trade, made a good living, the police protected you and there were courts of law and you didn't need a friend like me. But, now you come to me and you say ""Don Corleone, give me justice."" But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead, you come into my home on the day my daughter's to be married and you ask me to do murder for money.""",positive

"A great movie. Beyond it's reputation as a part of pop culture, this is a great story about a culture of people and about people and what they can become",positive
I never get tired of watching Brando and the family.,positive
Instant classic that put Al Pacino at the top. Marlon Brando gives the performance of a lifetime and Part II is second to Part I only because of Marlon.,positive
Overrated. Just kidding.,positive
A classic! Brando's best role ever... Te salute Don Corleone!,positive

You must watch this movie...Capiche?,positive
"It's just amazing. The fact that Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are in the same movie, it's just incredible. The soundtarck is also great as well as the story. It's just a classic and a-must reference for all the next mafia movies to come.",positive
It's a downer in an upper world--that's why it rules. :D,positive

"Brilliant story, acting, action, morals - a real epic in filmmaking",positive
The best movie so far on the face of the earth.,positive
the film to see if you havent,positive
Coppola was pretty young when he made this and I think that it really shows off his fulll potential which I'm not so sure was realized in later works (except Part II).,positive
I make him an offer he don't refuse.,positive
This is easily one of the top five films ever made.,positive
"Great movie, desribes mafia life",positive
It deserves to be AFI's 2nd best film.,positive
"An absolute classic that defines the genre. Brilliant performances by Brando, Pacino and the rest of the cast bring us the world of organised crime with commanding pathos. Along with its first sequel makes one of cinema's greatest epics. Part 3 is worth a look, but never lived up to the earlier efforts.",positive
Marlon Brando redifined acting and he shows what he is made of in the first of a great trilogy. The first film does beat the sequels in my opinion and it's the fantastic storyline and cast that tips it for me. Expect the unexpected in this.,positive
A classic offer that I can't refuse.,positive
its a pure classic...,positive

Pretty sad that I hadn't seen this until now. Amazing film. No wonder it's a classic. My only complaint is that there are absolutely no significant female roles in the film.,positive
"Think of every good thing you've heard about ""The Godfather"". Push aside every bad impression of ""Don Corleone"" you've ever heard... Now you're ready. Awesome. Rad.",positive
to call it a classic would be an understatement,positive
"I know it's a sin, but I couldn't really get into it...",negative
this movie should have 5 stars!,positive
One of he greatest movies of all time.,positive
ugh. too much shooting. but for what it is its very good.,positive

This has to be the original the Godfather of all Mafia flicks. A timeless movie. I would like to see a part 4!!! One of the best trilogys of all time.,positive

What's to say? It's perfect!,positive
It does not need any review...,positive
"American classic. Copolla really does a lot with what could have been a convoluting and boring ""talking movie"".",positive
Still not as good as the book.,negative
Only the best movie ever.,positive
The BEST movie ever made.,positive
i love how this movie is loosely based on the gevnoese family.,positive
"Anyone who thinks they might have seen The Godfather, or ""Didnt I read that in school or something.."" -- just stop doing that ! ! ! This movie deserves better than all those vague comments and possiblies. This is not just another violent movie, or ""anotrher maffia movie"". This is THE movie, THE reason why such a genre of films exist. Also the best series of movies and chronicle ever made. There are just so many cinematic beauties in this MEGA production. Although it is hard to say for sure what this movie 1-3 is about on a more hourly basis, the full production is considerably easier to sum up: We get to follow a half-Italian and also half-criminal family and some part of American history over three generations. But theres something so amazing in how one is lured in to the logic of the maffia and the hearts of these rather raw beasts... Do we get to understand these characters? We certainly get to see them and believe they exist (-ed). This movie is such a travel, such a convincing trip into another world. And its NOT only a guys movie, though it is a movie about guys.. and weird manliness is omnipresent though-out the whole series -- as a trap one might argue even.",positive
What can I say that hasn't already been said by millions of others? Pure cinematic genius.,positive
One of best movies ever made,positive
"Quite possibly the greatest piece of cinema ever created. I only wish I saw it in it's time, if you know what I mean.",positive

Brillaint - one of the best films ever made,positive
Fantastisk rett og slett,positive
"Really good, Im not really too into this whole genre but as a film in general it works excellently. Quite graphic at times but that just helps with the realism. Al Pacino excells! Quite want to watch the sequals now",positive
As good as everybody says. Maybe better.,positive
"Pretty much perfect except that, unlike its sequel, the original Godfather feels aged. The sequel is timeless.",positive
"Tremendous Film. This is certainly a movie you can watch over and over again. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino what more can you ask for?",positive
"marlon brando's silent toughness gets me everytime. ""i'll give you an offer you cannot refuse""",positive
Truly a master piece,positive
"Epic, Colossal, Divine!!!",positive
you've heard it all. i have nothing to add.,positive
The best film ever....ever! How could anyone give this less than 5*s?!?!,positive
The movie of all movies.,positive
Possibly the finest blockbuster ever made. Perfect filmmaking but still bettered by the sequel.,positive
"Here Coppola combined with Puzo to create an epic movie, that has being rated as the number one movie in almost all the movie indicators this world has seen. This itself gives the only reason why they call this is the greatest movie ever made. Marlon Brando plays his best ever acting role as 'Don Corleone' supported by great performances by Al Pacino, John Cazale, James Cann and Robert Duvall. This is movie where it will make you part of the story not one sitting in the audience. My favourite movie of all time and i pity those who are not interested. You haven't seen a movie if you haven't seen this.",positive
"Una obra de arte, o mejor dicho, LA obra de arte del cine moderno.",positive
"This is probably my choice for the best film of all time, it's flawless.",positive
I just don't see the appeal of this stuff. How are you supposed to sympathise with these scumbag characters? Goodfellas is the even worse. Both stars are for Marlon Brando.,negative
Surement un des meilleurs films que j'ai vu,positive
The greatest movie of all time! Love all gangster movies! This is a must see movie before u die!,positive

""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
"""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse""",positive
Johnny scappa 'ca Chiove!,positive
The greatest thing about this movie is you can watch it over and over and it still remains fresh. All the lines are perfect. No one is more badass than Marlon Brando.,positive
i can't be friends with you if you don't like or appreciate the godfather.,positive
"The Godfather and The Godfather, Part II are the best movies ever made...bar none. The closest thing we'll see to cinematic perfection for a long time. If you haven't seen both of these movies, please do so immediately.",positive
Pure brilliance. Puts all other gangster movies to shame. Brando back to his best and a shocker that Pacino didn't get an oscar.,positive
"Simply the greatest film of all time. Greatest scenes, greatest performances. I must of seen it over 200 times, i just love it! 59% Not interested?? God i hate the world.",positive

does it reall get any better,positive
"This Is A Fucking Classic, the greatest movie to win best picture at the oscars and arguably the greatest movie of all time, it features actors who kickstarted their careers with this movie, like Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. And features Marlon Brando as the main character: Don Vito Corleone, Brando Won A Best Actor Award for his performance. This is a movie you must see before you die!",positive

"CanÂ´t count how many times IÂ´ve seen this film...the ultimate gangster epic - and if you have also read the book, you won't be disappointed. Al Pacino almost did not get the part playing Michael Corleone, since he wasnÂ´t considered a Star at the time...Than God Coppola made the producers change their minds!",positive
ill make him an offer he cant refuse,positive
The Don of all films (pun intended),positive
Class. Nothing more left to say.,positive
best movie ever made... my Favorite movie,positive
Everyone MUST watch The Godfather. It's a classic that has so many references to it. It's a master piece (You also have to watch Part II & III).,positive
"Come on, it's The Godfather! What more do i have to say? Read the book too",positive
For a long time the best film I had ever seen,positive
There`s only one Godfather...,positive
"nothing to say, awesome",positive
Want to see it over and over again!,positive
"The best mafia flick in my book to date. Featuring an outstanding cast combined with Mario Puzo's excellent action-packed book acting as the storyline for the Corleone families chronicles - and the sequels that carry on the story (3 being slightly disappointing, in comparison to the previous two) to such a bitter end. Not to be missed or you'll definately have to 'go to the mattresses udderwise yill be sleepin' wid the fishes yurself!'.",positive
Masterpiece. You cannot miss this one. All three are great. This is superb.,positive
"a narrative masterpiece, albeit overated and a violence apologizer - marlon brando is a bit caricatural sometimes, not all the actors are good (james caan, the unbearable talia shire). good points to sterling hayden, thrilling.",negative
people say if u havnt watchd the godfather then uv gtno idea wt a movie is...i agree.al pacino stars in this classic that critics still acclaim as the perfect movie.its a mesmerizing experience,positive
The Greatest Movie Ever Made,positive
"Its just one of the best ever made! I can honestly say that I grew up on it, nothing beat it.",positive
one of my all time favorite movies!,positive
Not overrated. Every American should see this.,positive
"There is nothing bad to say about this movie. Aside from the fact that it is too perfect. At the end of the movie, I sat there for a couple of minutes absorbing, tasting, savoring the Godfather - for it is truly a film for the film buffs. The character growth and interaction is believable, and the atmosphere just puts you in a place where its like, you're there, with the family. Marlon Brando, you've become one hell of a contender. You've granted us this favor of giving us such a great film - it's only fair you give you the five stars you deserve. Damn shame we can't give you any more.",positive
"One of the best, if not The best movie there is.",positive
may this first movie be the most masculine of the series,positive
"what can i say, 'they made a movie, we cannot forget'",positive
A masterpiece! Brando doesn't even try hard and still he's spectacular (his idea to fill in his mouth cottonballs really paid off - people are still impersonating his character)!,positive
"The epitome of a gangster movie, an American classic with great subtelties of family importance",positive
Love the whole entire lot of the Godfather films,positive
I don't know what reasons people could find to not like this story. The only thing I could think of is the violence. But there is so much more to the story than just shooting guns. It has a lot of symbolism...one of the best movies experiences in cinema.,positive
Obligatory for all movie lovers.,positive

The Greatest!!!Simply said a monalisa of cinema.,positive
Oh man. I can't say enough about this movie...,positive
The Father of all gangster movies. Al Pacino crucially taking over Brando's place in Hollywood. The Brutal assassinations of Sonny Corleone and of Solozzo will forever be considered as classic scenes.,positive
Inmejorable pelÃ­cula donde Al Pacino y Brando nos dejan ver todo su potencial actoral. Muy fiel al libro es una de las mÃ¡ximas obras del cine,positive

Classic Film...a must for any film goers,positive
I have an offer U cant refuse...,positive
"Ever since I first became interested in films, this one has been raved about. Whenever those ""lists"" come out, this is constantly in the top 5 - more often than not, at the top. So, armed with a clipboard, a marker pen and some coffee, I finally sat down to watch it. None of the aforementioned were needed, the hype for this film is truly justified. Like the family that this film revolves around, this film commands respect - albeit quietly. It never drags or slows down during its near three hour run time, and the performances are stunning: Brando, Pacino and Duvall really make this film. There's not much else I can say. Any discerning film lover needs to see this, it really is oustanding.",positive
"Le harÃ© una oferta que no podrÃ¡ rechazar. Un hombre que no vive con su familia, no es un hombre",positive
gudomlig film. mÃ¥ste ses de som inte har sÃ¤tt.. top 10 me,positive
"The benchmark of the crime genre. The only possible downside is its association with the disaster that was the Godfather Part 3. The only thing better than The Godfather film is Mario Puzo's novel. Filled with lessons on life, power and all things cunning, The Godfather represents crime with class.",positive
One of the best movies ever made. I actually prefer part II of the franchise but then again I have always sided with De Niro over Pacino.,positive
Yet another masterpiece! I need to revisit again soon.,positive

"""Im gonna make you and offer you cant refuse."" Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are amazing. This is a classic. Ive literally seen it like 20 times! Ultimate mob movie!

Pure, raw genuis.",positive
A landmark film. This materpiece reveals more about the psychology of evil than a thousand peer reviewed journals.,positive

It's The Godfather... c'mon.,positive
"To be honest I'm getting sick of all the reviews that are like ""friggin Godfather NUFF SAID."" I mean, we KNOW. Watch it if you haven't, but try not to listen to hype. Don't get me wrong - it's great, but personally not in my top 20.",positive

cinematic masterrpiece!,positive
The three movies are more a study in power and family than the mob. This is really about the rise and fall of Michael Corleone,positive

Although I have seen it a thousand times it does not stop to be my all time favourite. Brando is great!!!!,positive
"I find it hard to seperate between the 3 parts, and the first, which starred Marlon Brando in such a hackneyed performance, is easily trumped by the 2nd and 3rd parts, in which Al Pacino is given prominence in Brandos' abscence",negative
"It was a good movie before I read the book, but afterwards I absolutely loved it. So if you are confused by it, read the book! Then you will understand the subtleties.",positive
Classic!!! 'Ill never forget the 1st time I saw it at about 12 years old.. Loved it eva since!,positive

Klassikko jo syntyessÃ¤Ã¤n.,positive
"its a revollutionary movie about the mafia, i love the whole cast",positive
"Marlon Brando (Don Corleone): I never wanted this for you. I work my whole life - I don't apologize - to take care of my family, and I refused to be a fool, dancing on the string held by all those bigshots. I don't apologize - that's my life - but I thought that, that when it was your time, that you would be the one to hold the string. Senator Corleone; Governor Corleone. Well, it wasn't enough time, Michael. It wasn't enough time. Al Pacino (Michael): We'll get there, pop. We'll get there.",positive

Second to Goodfellas.,positive
best movie of all time,positive
"The Godfather is a classic for so many reasons. This movie translates into so many different themes. Anyone can find a quote from this film that speaks to them. Somehow some way, Coppola was able to translate this epic story into one of the greatest mafia films (or any film for that matter) ever displayed.",positive
"My idea of a ""perfect"" film. And I have seen it dozens of times.",positive
"My all time favorite movie and watched it at least 10 times. Love the music, people and culture.",positive

"Classic, enough said",positive
Great. Classic crime movie. Essential viewing for all.,positive
"Forget The Sopranoes there is only one family, and this is the greatest movie in it's genre. This film made huge stars of Al Pacino and Robert Duvall, but for me it is the underated James Caan that steals the film.",positive

Classic starring Marlone Brando the Don of the famous Carleyone family.,positive
This should be considered the greatest movie ever made - not Citizen Kane. The Godfather is one of those great films that has never divided the critics with the audience - so many websites with movie ratings have testified this.,positive
"First part out of 3 films that compose the greatest achievement in cinematography. SImply the best movie ever made. Dive into the universe of the Corleone Family and get attach to charachters who are mean, psychotic and megalomaniac. Corleone Family Rocks!!!",positive

I've watched this movie about a million times.,positive
"one of the all time greats! pacino rocks the shit. unfortunately it de-generated into #3, which was one of the all time piles of monkey poop",positive
No question about it. The best movie of all time. Hands down!,positive
"Okay, I don't think I really need to say anything, but I will. Everyone knows [or should know] that Coppola broke the mold with this movie. This movie is the, well, Godfather, of Italian crime syndicate films, at least here in the States. The cast is amazing. The cinematography is so...for lack of the correct adjective, I'll just say a lot of thought went into it and the formalism is awesome. Everyone needs to see it!",positive
"I know I'm going to be stoned for this, but I am not a fan",negative
its why they invented movies in the first place,positive
one of the best movies ever made,positive
The Cheapest Movie Ever Made,negative

Intense. Every actor is on point. Except Kays ugly ass,positive
"Not just this one, the whole series of films are a masterpiece. Brando's greatest performance",positive
slower than watching a slug watch paint dry!,negative
The godfather is probably one of the best movies that you could see! If you're italian you have to see this movie because if you don't you're not really italian!!,positive

it aint called the godfather for nothing,positive
"Tremenda, impresionante.",positive
"If there is anything you want to learn about life, you can, simply by watching Don Vito Corleone. This is not just a movie, It is a revolution. The whole aura of the movie is amazing. The whole magnitude of the Don's supremacy is breath taking. All hail the Don!",positive
A movie you can't refuse,positive
"Classic - score, cinematography, Marlon and Al - Fantastic",positive
It was alright. I expected more from the hype and the ensemble.,negative
THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME.,positive
"Classic, you have to see it to be considered a human being.",positive
"Marlon Brando's speech impediment aside, this is a terrible movie. No, seriously: it's too long, unrealistic, has too many characters and is far too violent. It should be banned. Wow, I'm a great liar.",positive
"Kvalitet och spÃ¤nning i samma film tycker jag Ã¤r sÃ¤llsynt, men denna ser jag gÃ¤rna om.",positive
"What makes The Godfather stand out so? It's perfect blend of unflawed acting, story telling, imagery and music? Not many films have achieved that for sure, but what makes Godfather something unforgettable is its exploration of the people who reside in the world of organized crime. Some of them seem more human than most law followers. Others, such as Don Vito Corleone, seem something beyond human, something omniscient and God-like.",positive
even if you don't like this movie you still have to appreciate it.,positive
The best mafia movie ever!!,positive
"If you don't like this movie then you just can't be a film fan, lol.",positive
There are very few movies that even come close to the Godfather. The acting is near perfection. The story is intriguing. This movie is likeable by nearly any type of moviegoer.,positive
One of the best movies ever made by man.,positive
es una de esas peliculas para los chavos... pero debo admitir q es buena!!,positive
BEST FILM EVER AND BEST TRILOGY EVER,positive

outstanding!!! a true classic. 1 of the many doovde's u should own!!!,positive
"The only 3 hour movie that you wish was longer. Great cast. Worthy of all the praise it has received over the years. A timeless movie that cannot be dupilicated. Awesome in its simplicity. No special effects, just cinematic magic.",positive
The greatest movie of all time.,positive
"Believe me, I understand the influence that Coppola and ""The Godfather"" have had on cinema and the crime syndicate genre, but much like the Beatles and their influence on pop music, better bands have come along and made better albums since then. This is *not* the benchmark.",negative
Luca Brazi sleeps with the fishes,positive
"If I had to decide what was the best work cinema made during my lifetime (b.1950), The Godfather films would be among the first that I'd have to consider. It's odd, because when The Godfather film came out i 1972, I was far from alone in thinking that it was a competent and well-told updating of the traditional gangster film. It's strange that it began to acquire its iconic status well after initial release. It has all the strengths of Mario Puzo's novel, but manages to avoid most the novel's limitations. Puzo the novelist can write and is a fine story-teller; and his film script (written with director Coppola) is top-notch. But there's something of the soap-opera about the book that the films manages to transcend by emphasising the deeper aspects of the story -- aspects that lie well beneath the surface of Puzo's straightforward prose. It's hard to say exactly what makes this such a great film. Puzo has said he wanted to write a book about family. Perhaps that's it: the deeper aspects of the story address the issues of blood ties and tragic downfall that are common to some of the great mythological stories. However, if I had to pick out one elemental thing that the film shows (all three of them -- not just this one), it would be the penalty of free will and the power of decision. We're in the Garden of Eden again. Near the beginning of the first scene, the family's good boy Michael Corleone says ""That's my family Kay; it's not me."" When Michael does make his decision to go with the family he proves to be at least as ruthless as anyone else, and considerably more clever. He preserves some sense of honour with his family and his ""business"" at first; but then he makes another choice in deciding that the Corleone family is going to ""entirely legitimate."" Hypocrisy! Things go downhill from that time, culminating in this film with him ordering the deaths of the opposing heads of families, and even of his brother-in-law who betrayed him. Michael is brought down by his own decisions, and the fall has the inevitability of great tragedy. The fall is worked out across the following films. The Godfather captures all this by a number of means. Above all there are the towering performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the father and the youngest son; but there's not a single weak link in this stellar cast, right down to a brilliant, almost silent performance from Richard Bright as the protector-executioner Al Neri. Then there is the pacing of events: the contrasts between shots during single scenes are perfect in that they always capture something deeper about the characters -- think of the wedding party outside and the shots of Sonny and the bridesmaid heatedly screwing inside (the film's suggestive economy in this shot makes a telling contrast with the book's dwelling on the physical attributes of both parties); or the chilling contrast between Tom Hagan's cooly detached behaviour (a superb Robert Duvall) at the meal with the ""big-shot movie producer,"" and the terrifying consequence in the infamous horse's head sequence. But there's something else that is overlooked in most reviews -- the subtle way in which this film uses music. Much of the music, including the well-known main theme, was written by Nino Rota, who's also well know for his work with Fellini. Each instalment of the Godfather trilogy has at least one towering scene in which the power of music underwrites and elevates the inner aspects of the story; and in this one it's the christening-plus-killing scene towards the end. The gradual shift in sound from the quietly atmospheric playing as the christening starts to the more measured and mechanical tread as the killers prepare(Bach's Passacaglia in C minor at first, which then becomes a bizarre version of Britten's Agnus Dei from the Missa Brevis) , to the sound of the baby crying over the music -- and then the killings, all in quick succession. So multi-layered! Terrifying! Superb!",positive
Masterpiece - no wonder its #1 of all time! (almost),positive
"Loathed though I am to follow the crowd, there is no doubt that this is a brilliant film.",positive

"Cinematically innovative in its day, so assured ""classic"" status among film buffs and academics. Wildly over-rated, partly because film ""authorities"" rate it so highly, I suspect. About two hours too long for me. I'd prefer being poked with a stick by way of entertainment. I hate mobster movies.",negative
"Classic movie, very well made.",positive
Absolutely love this movie.... an ALL TIME classic!!!!!,positive
i didn't understand what the guy was saying; weird accent,negative

One of the greats if not the greatest.,positive
"black people, stop watching these racist movies",negative
The greatest film ever made. Marlon Brando young actors take note!!,positive
A must see for anyone. Enough said.,positive
"Considered by some to be the greatest film ever. It's impossible to argue with how well-made and acted it is. More a film about family than about the mafia, it's dynamite to watch from either perspective. However, like ""Pulp Fiction"" twenty years later, you admire the craftsmanship, but feel guilty because the heroes are not nice people.",positive
Pretty badass movie.,positive
A clever classic film putting together the grand talents of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.,positive
"Amazing movie, best ever made. The cast is great, the director - everything. Especially Al Pacino.",positive

"Great movie about the cicilian mob. And the action of this kind which influenced potical , economical issues.",positive
The greates movie ever made by mankind ever.,positive
"A classic movie vividly painting a portrait into the old lifestyle of a true Gangster. When it meant being a goon in the 1940's mafia. In this film, a powerful family in the mafia is losing its grip, and other families are picking this one apart. The Don's son returns, and finds himself involved in the mafia. I like how these guys were kinda protesting the drug business. Mobsters don't have any heart anymore these days. A wonderful creation of a film.",positive
Every man must see and live according to the principals contained in this movie. It is a male right of passage.,positive
NO COMMENT EVEN REQUIRED,positive
worship Al Pacino and The Godfather series!,positive
"A Masterpiece. Everything about this movie is perfect, from Marlon Brando's iconic performance, to the flawless script and direction by Coppola and Puzo, the gorgeous cinematography, the lush score by legendary composer Nino Rota and finally the performance that cemented Al Pacino's status as one of the greatest actors of all time. To experience The Godfather is an offer no one can refuse.",positive

Hands down the best film of all time.,positive
59%? c'mon they dont make movies like this anymore...,positive
"The ultimate ""family movie"", in two ways. I like the slow, epic, meticulous, opera-like rhythm of the movie. More personally, I find it an endless source of management wisdom, especially in the university environment! ""Strictly business, nothing personal.""",positive
The Godfather is the i ching!,positive
Best Movie Ever. Simple as that!,positive
"It is clearly the best Mafia movie ... Marlon Brando are really good as mafia boss.The story begins as ""Don"" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia ""family"", oversees his daughter's wedding. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and ""family"". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don's fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the family.",positive

Coppola is the greatest director of all time...,positive
"Times have changed. It's not like the Old Days, when we can do anything we want. A refusal is not the act of a friend. If Don Corleone had all the judges, and the politicians in New York, then he must share them, or let us others use them. He must let us draw the water from the well. Certainly he can present a bill for such services; after all... we are not Communists.",positive

interesting to see how 59% are not... interested in watching this movie... I guess they prefer Adam Sandler stupid movies...,positive
Movies doesn't get better than this. It's a masterpiece and the funny part is that Francis Ford Coppola made this trilogy to get money to make Apocalypse Now!. Marlon Brando as DonVito Corleone is a good enough reason to see this movie. I LOVE IT!,positive
la mejor pelicula del mundo,positive
"Who the hell are the 59% who aren't interested in seeing Marlon Brando in the most complete performance of his career? Who isn't interested in seeing Al Pachino actually act (and he was so good at it)? Seriously. It IS on the best movies of all time and everyone should see it. Why you ask? Because on the day of your daughter's wedding, you will regret not having seen it.",positive
one of the best movies i have seen marlin brando rox,positive
"The best story. period. Book, movie, whatever, they all tell an enticing plot and great characters.",positive
Nothing bad can be said about this movie. Brilliant.,positive
Simply the greatest film ever made.,positive
Blokes movie they say ......... I think not.,positive
simply a master piece...,positive
"""He'll Make You An Offer You Can't Refuse"" A globally recognizable film, sheepishly that I had put off until now. Mobs flms did not hold much interest for me earlier. Director Francis Ford Coppola is a genius! He was at his best when he directed this masterpiece.This is the movie that made stars of James Caan, Robert Duval, Diane Keaton, and Al Pacino. The movie that garnered 3 Academy Awards and 5 Golden Globes. In my books, the film of epic proportions. If you havent already seen this, it is well worth your time. This is compelling, gripping and intense on so many levels. A cinematic treat indeed!!",positive

BEST MOIVE EVER MADE,positive
"My absolute favorite of all time, and not even just this one, the whole saga, Francis Ford Coppola is a master!",positive
"Una de las mejores pelÃ­culas de todos los tiempos. La Ãºltima escena de la pelicula, cuando Michael Corleone discute con Kay, le niega que estÃ© involucrado en los ""negocios familiares"", para finalmente recibir los elogios de Clemenza(con reverencia incluida) tras el cierre de la puerta de su despacho, es impactante, de leyenda.",positive
"the thing is that is not only business, always the first one is the famly",positive
"Ha, this about sums up Marlon Brando... 100% BA",positive
One of the greatest movies ever. Coppola kills.,positive
The best movie ever made!,positive
awesome movie. one of the best of the 20th century. and it's got al pacino before he got really funny looking.,positive
The best movie ever made.,positive
Had to rate this high; it was a deal I couldn't refuse.,positive
amazing! i loved it!,positive
"My favourite movie ever. To all my friends who wanna know, this is what got me into speaking in an italian accent",positive
The greatest acting ever and an awesome script!,positive
"Watch the last 10 minutes of the film for the dialogue between Al Pacino and Diane Keaton...profound, beautiful and so very very powerful...but you have to see the entire film in order to get to this point in the journey.",positive
In my opinion the best of the trilogy although followed closely by The Godfather 2.,positive
"WOOT, greatest mob movie ever!!",positive
MOST OVER RATED FILM EVER. WELL THATS JUST MY OPINION,negative
hate this movie with a passion,negative
Best Picture - 1972. need i say more?,positive

"You don't have to have Italian blood to totally appreciate this, do you? Well, as I do, it went straight to my heart (in a dagger like way). Great flick.",positive
This is THE movie and the only one!,positive
This movie is the reason why there is even a genre of gangster movies,positive
the only other drama movie that is better than this one was the second,positive
En triologi som man bÃ¶r ha sett...se vidare pÃ¥ film 2 och 3,positive
"Skrevet av Mario Puzo og filmatisert av Coppola. Vi tror pÃ¥ at denne historien og beskrivelsen ligger veldig nÃ¦rt virkeligheten. Karakterene bringes til liv som ekte personer. Marlon Brando er Gudfaren, man er ikke i tvil et sekund. Al Pacino er strÃ¥lende i sin forvandelse til mafia boss. MiljÃ¸et, musikken, menneskene er right on!",positive
Best depiction of the Mafia,positive
"not just a mafia history, a deep phylosophy inside. You really have to think while watching it, not just action",positive
"""And may their first child, be a masculine child""",positive
It's a monument from the cinema. The casting is wonderfull.,positive
A classic. Every person in America should see this.,positive
"Simply put, the best film ever made. Perfect script, perfect cast, perfectly shot.",positive
this film cant b beaten!,positive
One of the best movies..,positive
wgat to say? mister Coppola did it again. and Al Pacino with Marlon Brando is winning combination,positive
The person you secretly aspire to be..........Don Corleone,positive
The best trilogy of ALL TIME...,positive
If I had to say anything I'd be doing this film a disservice.,positive
The Greatet Movie of all time. Period.,positive
"No other mafia movie can even be entertaining compared to this. A great series, fantastic movie, and a film that keeps you curious all the time.",positive
"Babaaa, bÃ¼yÃ¼ksÃ¼nnn!",positive
"Timeless, master piece.",positive
The greatest movie all the time nothin compare,positive
MUST SEE CLASSIC NO1,positive
"THE mafia movie of all times. marlon brando in the rike of his life, al pacino in the role of his life, such a great lineup, such a storyline, perfect directing, perfect production. a must see and love!",positive
The story is as nicelly told as in the book + great acting.,positive
si ta pas vue sa tu manque de koi,positive
the great movie of all times really it's great starting from the movie music and to the great thoughts of revange :-),positive
As good as its reputation says it is. A must see classic.,positive
"Hard to beat this film. So much style, such a great story, such perfect acting...",positive
"One of the ultimate classics, the only thing that I didn't like was the very beggining; too much of the party it was a little boring. I'm a big Al Pacino fan and he was great in this.",positive
this film is the nuts i love it i have got the hole boxset of the Godfather and i dont get bored watching then eather,positive
"First of all, it had Marlon Brando.",positive
Coppola's masterpiece.Her sahne her cekim mukemmel.Bunu izleyerek olebilirim:),positive
It can't get any better,positive
An amazing movie. Great characters and a great plot. There's a mood to the movie that just captures you from the very first minute and keeps you interested all the way through.,positive
"""Make him an offer he can't refuse"". Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterful social drama ""The Godfather"" is filled with sensational lines, just like this one, and characters (kudos to Marlon Brando's Don Corleone) that have captured the collective consciousness of moviegoers.",positive
again a lot of people prefer the second film but brandos performance is just supreme with quality supporting roles in particular james caan,positive
"""The Godfather"" doesn't need a review...it's ""The Godfather""",positive
"Coppola is a genius. Acting = perfect, storyline amazing",positive
Do you spend time with your family? Good. Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.,positive
"Amazing film. Truly an achivement in the cinematic experiance. It was very long, but completely appropriate for the mood that it was trying to set. Good representation of how the world isn't all fun and games.",positive
"a stunning cast, Brando and Pacino are invincible actors, screenplayÂ´s pure - as good as can be, Coppola as always a master",positive
back when movies didn't have to be nonstop action (needless to say its kind of boring),positive
Simply the best gangster film ever,positive
The books are always better than any of the movies! But...,positive
"A timeless movie, surpassed by few. This movie is an important piece to the art and movie community. A must see for anyone.",positive
You know how they call this one of the best movies ever made? They're absolutely right.,positive
Loved it because I love the Mafia!!!!,positive
brando and pacino are genious,positive
"Absolute classic. Fantastic cast, great story, great acting. it's really got it all. Check it out, it's absolutely worth it. Also, Mario Puzo's novel for which the movie based is also one of the best I've read.",positive
5 stars. enough said,positive
"Another classic. Coppola is a genius, because he takes a movie about a group of cut-throat mobsters, and creates a sense of empathy for them... brilliant.",positive
Nummer ett i tilogin men nummer tvÃ¥ i min ordning,positive

one of the greatest movies of all time.. classic,positive
Its the godfather....,positive
Definitivamente la pelicula que he visto mas veces en mi vida...,positive
I never get tired of seeng it again.,positive
"Truly one of the great movies of all time, The Godfather has great acting, a great story, and a great musical score. Like any movie, it's definitely not for everybody, but it's one of those films that everyone should see at least once.",positive
the best movie in all times,positive
"The best gangster movie I have ever seen. powerful starcast, gripping screenplay, excellent direction. Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino were fantastic. Must see for everyone.",positive
I love mobster movies and this one speaks for itself.,positive
"I can't imagine what kind of a person would want to sit through this stuffy old boring movie. I hear they make you watch this for college papers. God, this Coppola guy is an alias for Ed Wood.",negative
Hands down a classic for all time,positive
"Parts one and two add up to an amazing family saga. Leave the gun, take the cannoli.",positive
"No explanation needed, its just awesome.",positive
The best maphia film with the best cast ever.,positive
my favorite movie of all time,positive
"Yeah, it's maybe one of the best.",positive
"ah yes. this is a very well done movie but loses some it's luster when you think about the damage it has done but spawning so many shitty, shitty ganster films.",negative
Better than most modern day gangster flicks combined.,positive
"The books are way better than any of the movies! But the movies are very well done as well, especially the 1st one! Marlon Brando's perfomance is just the best! and what can I even say about Al Pacino's? Simply a CLASSIC!",positive
I absolutely loved it.,positive
one of the best films ever made,positive
bello bello ....miiIII,positive
The best gangster film also one of the only films that is very close to the book.,positive
"marlon brando, need I say more?",positive
this has to be one of the all time BEST movies!,positive
One of my fave films of all time. This film has always been in my top ten of films. I don't have a bad thing to say about it,positive
The original classic movie. BUY IT.,positive
It has everything...,positive
"The movie of all movies, the GODFATHER of ALL MOVIES",positive
"Brando can be really good (On the Waterfront, Streetcar named Desire) or really bad (almost everything else). In Godfather he is in full form, and delivers a classic performance. After you get past the ""coolness"" of seeing Pacino so young, you realize he doesn't act that well in the film, although part of that is the fact that Caan and Duvall are at their best here.",positive
"Even if this weren't such a great movie, the beautiful old cars alone would be worth watching it for. The young Al Pacino is awesome. This movie came out before I was born and yet still feels contemporary somehow--a timeless classic.",positive
i love shot em up bang bang films!!!,positive
Genious. There is nothing better than this movie. I could be flogged while watching it and still fucking love the almost three hours of brilliance.,positive
"what the hell can u say, marlon brando just does it all (not to mention everyone else :P)",positive
this movie is what made me want to be in the mob.,positive
StronG Movie + Great + Classic,positive
The classic film against which all ovies should be judged.,positive
Worth all the hype. Not a glimmer of being overrated.,positive
Greatest mobster movie ever is probably an understatement.,positive
This is by far the greatest movie ever made. Hands down.,positive
"Godfather trilogy, StarWars, Tarantino flicks... these are all must-see's",positive
"The penultimate gangster flick, classic doesn't begin to decribe it. Great cast, great score, great plot. Brilliant!",positive
Great film. The acting and story sucks you right into the gangster world.,positive
I love it. I have seen it like 100 times.,positive
you haven't lived until you've seen all 3,positive

Really it is the best movie i ever seen!,positive
The Best Movie ever made!!!,positive
riktigt bra.. Al pacino Ã¤r bÃ¤st!!,positive
"Watched this again recently, and beyond the obvious perfection of the assembled actors, the camera work by Gordon Willis is the real star. It's subtle, beautiful, and dramatic without once taking the viewer out of the world he has created with Coppola and crew. A lesson many filmmakers fail to learn alas...",positive
i want to see it for the 8th time! ;),positive

"""nunca estes en contra de la familia"" lla mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos...",positive

No movie can possibly top the sheer power of every scene. I get chills when I watch it.,positive
Awesome movie. Unfortunately doesn't deal as much with action as much as the actual mob business but still a great movie nonetheless.,positive
Perfection. A movie about how evil corrupts and the pain of wanting out.,positive
"Adelantandose varias decadas la produccion de este super clasico, va mas alla y construye un hito en el 7 arte",positive
THis movie is an offer you can't refuse. It rulez,positive

I think I need to watch this again. Why is it that mob movies always make the mob look like a total of 10 guys?,negative
Find me a better made movie in the last 40 years (that isn't Part II).,positive
A great movie! All three Godfather movies are the bomb. Love the Brando voice.,positive

i can appreciate how well-made it is and see how so many people can obbsess over it... but towards the end i was more than ready for it to be over.,positive
Best motion picture ever...PERIOD,positive
"best movie about the mafia... and during the whole movie, they never say the word 'mafia'",positive
Can't be compared to anything else. It's a perfect film in every sense of the word.,positive
I never realized so many famous actors starred in this movie. It is an amazing movie during its time.,positive
Flawless. Completely Flawless.,positive
Best movie ever? Quite possibly.,positive
Brando: el Don maestro,positive
"amazing cast, amazing story, nicely filmed, each movie should follow the godfather blueprint",positive
"The film you can't refuse. The quintessential work of the 1970's or perhaps of the latter half of the 20th century as some would argue. Being my number one, I'd concur on both fronts. I hate proclaiming things to be 'perfect,' but after repeated viewings, you'd be hard pressed to find at least one flaw (that really matters). In a career of memorable performances, Marlon Brando is immortalized for his portrayal of an aging Sicilian kingpin who rules over his empire with bulldog cheeks and swift Mafia justice. The world was introduced to Al Pacino in the role of the Don's youngest son Michael, who reluctantly assumes control in his notorious father's stead. No dramatic scene is led astray, no act of violence is without motive and no beautifully ornate scenery is laid to waste. The masterpiece of its generation: The Godfather.",positive
"Overrated, yet watchable movie, but the only movie I liked about the mob was A Bronx Tale, so maybe it's just me.",negative
"Jeg har faen meg ikke ord. Den er så bra, så bra. Den er så nydelig. Se, jeg bare gjentar meg selv. Hvorfor plassere følelsen i abstrakte ord?",positive
"This movie is simply the best movie ever created. I was once asked what makes a great movie and my response to the person was; great script, great story, great casting, great acting, great directing and a great soundtrack to compliment the mood of the story being told. Godfather simply encompasses all of these and does an excellent job blending them to create and epic masterpiece. This movie is over 29 years old and like fine wine, man has it aged well. 20/10 ****************",positive
The Godfather of mob movies- a classic.,positive
Is this...really neccesary?,positive
In a word perfect. The plot is well thought out and the acting was top notch it doesn't get better than this.,positive
An all-time classic!,positive
Phenomenal - Marlon Brando has the greatest screen presence.,positive
"If I could admit that this movie is so good that I get a hard on and people not think I'm weird, I would.",positive
"greatest movie ever, no competition",positive
"my all time number one film. The acting from Pacino as Michael throughout the film is as good as Brandos. The turnpike, the horses head, the shooting in the restaurant are all great scenes. Luca Brasi Sleeps with the fishes",positive
"What can I say about this film that hasn't already beeb said. How about ""It reminds me of some of Adam Sandler's earlier fims""",positive

the!!!!!!!!!!!!! greatest Italian mobster movie of all time .......,positive
"In reading others' ratings of this movie, I have to agree. It is an American masterpiece. The best of its kind, I think. Some may praise Brando above all else, but I'm personally a fan of James Caan. All of the characters in this movie hold their own. No one is overshadowed, and each is unique. A classic, to say the least.",positive
All actors should be forced to watch this before they so much as see a stage.,positive
If you are male and don't like this you are not really a man. Great cast too.,positive
"one of the top 5 movies of all times. some thinks its only top mobster or crime movie but then they missed alot more about the movie. check out the music, the mood, the way the movie is shot, the way the feelings are portrayed and the way darkness intermingles w/ hope. also, even tho this movie is terribly long and i already know the plot, i always get sucked into it and can watch it infinite amount of times - something you cant say for most thrillers that you already know the plot to. the fact this movie has 3 parts and you see michael (pacino) grow both as the character and as the actor has almost no parallel to any other movie.",positive

"Betrayal, lies, and deceit, What's not to like?",positive
"Un chef d'oeuvre du genre dÃ» evidemment Ã  la prestation de Marlon Brando, monstrueux, et vraiment dans la peau du parrain don corleone. Un film mafieux, ou Al pacino est dans ses premiers grand role au coter du grand rÃ©alisateur Francis Ford Coppola. Les moments avec Brando sont vraiment mÃ©morable, avec sa machoire de mÃ©chant.

"""Leave the gun, take the cannoli.""",positive
No rating.. a classic.,positive
Its too good so no comments,positive
"Easy to see why it is regarded as one of the best of all time. The Godfather is a well calculated film presenting an intriguing story and several themes in a beautiful fashion. The story begins with a sense of mystery but does not linger on the fact, rather it cuts into multiple levels of discovery. This is easily the most well used film for its long running time, constantly full of emotion and needed feeling. The story is well used and connects on several points and all the characters change, leaving behind their bodies for dead or at the very least their innocent nature. This is a film about bad people doing bad things but it does an impeccable job making evil feel human and even good natured. It is a powerful idea used perfectly that lets you root for the bad guys in a way that will never be outmatched. I give this film a 10.0 out of 10.0. The writing is great, the music is great, and the acting is great. It was surprisingly very personal and warm. ----------------------------------------------- High character interest, low story value. The Godfather Part II was totally unneeded. The first film clearly shows that no good will come from the family's future but this film goes ahead and reveals their doom. It feels much longer than the first, but remains interesting enough. The ending feels uncompleted. None of the new issues feel resolved; instead more people die out of revenge and doubt as the film chases the genius of the first story. Why is this annoying? The ending takes us no where new. The Godfather doesn't gain any more power, nor does he lose it. His family may be falling apart but the film ends with him in a state that does not suggest defeat or victory. Instead of coming full circle this film loses itself in trying to copy situations and settings of the first that simply needed change in a second outing. I give this film a 7.0 out of 10.0. This movie simply takes the themes of the first and obsesses over them, some will like this fact while others may demand more.",positive
Great Acting - very compelling plot - a must see for any real movie lover.,positive
"Great writing, great acting, great directing, and great music combine to create what is deservedly a classic of cinema. For years I had heard the hype of how great a movie this is supposed to be; normally, a movie isn't able to live up to such hype, but The Godfather goes far beyond it.",positive
The best ....... Must seee,positive
Greatest mafia movie ever! If you haven't seen you're missing out on movie history.,positive
"Une fois par annÃ©e, je rÃ©coute les trois dans un week-end chips et Parrain...Le bonheur.",positive
This movie deserves nothing short of 5 stars. NOTHING. they should make a 6th star just for The godfather. He'll make you an offer you can't refuse.,positive
"A good movie to learn how to do business, except for the killing and beating, of course.",positive
The mafia movie to end all mafia movies. Brando and Pacino are amazing.,positive
One of the best movie of all time!!!,positive
This movie is my top favorite,positive
"Top five best movies of all time, end of discussion.",positive
The best movie of all time.,positive
"Amazing, completely realistic about the mafia scene in New York, Al Pacino, good long movie, book was amazing, which the movie came from, and this is a good remake. Better than the Lord of the Rings book to movie duo, and shatters Harry Potter with a garrot wire on the side!",positive
Why can't I give this six stars?,positive
The most classic mobster movie there is out there. Francis Ford Coppola created a masterpeice in this movie. It has all the elements of a classic that you'll watch over and over.,positive
Best movie ever! Great acting,positive
the best movie in the world,positive
The Godfather is the Godfather of all movies in history,positive
Classical. Well worth watching even if you don't like the genre.,positive
Easily the best American film ever made. Unreal performances highlight a near-flawless script. It's hard to think of a more referenced movie in American film history.,positive
"If you've never seen this movie, RENT THIS NOW! This movie has flawless acting by Marlon Brnado and great acting by everyone else. If you consider yourself a gangster movie fan and have never seen this movie, you should be ashamed",positive
A masterpiece. Marlon Brando is unforgettable. The atmosphere of this film is awe-inspiring. Few films have ever drawn me in quite like this one.,positive
Only the best gangster film ever created,positive
Comments are not necessary. The greatest movie of all time.,positive
"The Godfather was and still is one of the best mafia movies ever made. Old as it may be, the cast make Mario Puzo's story jump right out of the book, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and James Caan...who could ask for more?",positive
"Finally got to watch this from beginning to end. Good film, stands up to the test of time.",positive
Overlong. But excellent. It's the friggin Godfather.,positive

"if u tell me u r a fan of gangster movies and u haven catch this, u should catch it as soon as u get yr hands on it. all the elements love hate power etc is present in this flim. Though this was produced in the 1970s it still proves to one of the greatest flim of all time.",positive
the snooze father....,negative
Al Pacino - what else can I say?,positive
"For some reason, I cannot say that it is the greatest film ever (Did you say Citizen Kane? Come on, at least Godfather has a case to make)... Though many people believe so. Maybe when I saw it the first time, I was a kid, and somehow my more recent viewings were shadowed by my first. Still, a magnificent movie and stellar story telling by Coppola. Isn't it interesting that he is best buddies with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg since they launched their careers :-) What a stark difference in film making. Great characters all around.",positive
Greatest Film Ever Made.,positive
The best movie ever!,positive
What did you do for me huh? Everything...,positive
The fact this only has 4 stars rating is a complete joke.Greatest gangster film ever made.,positive

"soy culpable de que me encante los clasicos, estoy de acuerdo con el dicho lo de antes era mejor!! un clasico film de la mafia italiana, pero con toques muy inteligentes y actuaciones de primera, como no va ser buena si esta MARLON BRANDO!!!y dios mioo para mi de los mejores directores francis ford coppola!!",positive
That's my first love to Frank Ford Coppola's movie. I used to put my tongue between chin and teeth and talked like Godfather when I was a kid!,positive

a classic!! love it ~,positive
greatest. movie. ever.,positive
The best mobster movie...period!,positive
A masterpiece... No need to say something elsa..,positive
The classic of mob classics. Coppola has you totally conflicted as to whether to love or hate these people. I almost can't believe this was produced in 1972 - the authenticity and production beats most of today's films hands down. The wedding scenes and shots in Sicily are a beautiful respite from the dark mafia sanctums in NYC. Brilliant performances.,positive
The original Mafia movie. Nothing else even comes close.,positive
"come on, best movie ever",positive

"Words can not described how much i love this movie!! Everything about this movie is beautiful! The acting, the actors, the music, EVERYTHING!!! THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE PERIOD",positive

"Everything about this film is executed with near perfection. script, directing, acting, lighting, soundtrack, casting, pacing.",positive
Undoubtedly the best movie ever. All the superstars performs at their full best. Make sure you read the novel first. this is a rare case where the film is as good as the book.,positive

My all time favourite movie...nothing comes close to this!,positive
"Don't get me wrong, I like The Godfather, but it's just a bit long...",positive
"This one just sinks its hook in you and never lets go. It's just completely engrossing and memorable in every way: the images, the dialogue, the music, the cinematography, and everything else just goes into creating the world that this film takes place in. I first saw this when I was 14 and really getting into film. The Godfather was at the top of my lists of must sees if I was going to be serious about movies, and I've been a fanatic ever since. For me, the Godfather doesn't really get anything wrong, I couldn't sit here and tell you what the big flaw in the film is, for me, it doesn't really have one. There are so many moments in here that I always go back to, most of all the sequence with Michael in the Italian restuarant. The part where he's come back from the bathroom with the gun and the guys talking to him, but they just stay on Pacino's face and you can just see all the gears turning, not in Pacino's head, but the character's-just brilliant. That whole sequence is my favorite part in the movie, but there's so many other moments that I can just play over and over in my head, the horse head, Sonny beating the shit out of his brother in law, Sonny getting hit (best death scene of all time), Connie flipping out on her husband, that scene with Brando and Pacino, the Batism sequence, fuck, just everything, I'm wasting space listing them all. The crown jewel of this film though, is Pacino's performance. Everybody talks about Brando in relation to this film, and he deserves it, but for my money, Al Pacino gives the best performance in the film, as well as his career. Top 3 all time on my list for any actor. I could go on all day about this movie, but I don't even want to know how goddamn long this review is, if you can even call this a review, so I'm just gonna stop. I'm probably gonna watch the film when I get home too, I've gotten myself excited.",positive
"Una obra maestra. Como dicen los franchutes: ""plus vrai que nature"" (y no hablo sÃ³lo del gran Brando).",positive
best movie ever made,positive
The best movie ever made. A true masterpiece.,positive
Maybe the best movie ever made. One of the few films that is better than the book upon which it is based.,positive

"i donÂ´t find stars enough to rate this movie. it is just simple, the best movie ever!!!",positive
An virtually flawless piece of cinema. An example of how to perfectly pace a film so it's lengthy running time seems to flash past. Stupendously good and truly epic.,positive
Rightly considered one of the greatest films of all time.,positive
The father of mafia movie.,positive
Kesinlikle mÃ¼kemmel bir film,positive
excellent film as u can see i have watched the 3 of them fantastic in the same day,positive

The greatest movie ever!!,positive
it was about time that i saw this. Def has the whole pinache that we've come to sterotype organized crime by. Marlon Brando is memorable in this iconic role as Don Corleone. Al Pacino seems kinda stiff in this role but i'm sure to expect more from him when i finish the triology. Great supporting performances by the rest of the Corleone family.,positive
"One is number 1. Supported by James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Al Pacino, Marlon Brando's performance is incomparible. With all these great performers comes a captivating story of family, honour and respect, masterfully brought to life by Francis Ford Coppolla. A truly great film.",positive
classic all the way through,positive
"Pacino, Caan, Brando & Duvall! All in the same movie directed by Coppola! Fantastic!and still THE BEST mafia movie.",positive
"A masterpiece. It doesn't need a review, it speaks for itself. In my top 7.",positive
Best film of all time!!!,positive
Legendary. Enough said.,positive
i think there is no movie like it it is amazing Marlin Brando and Al pacino are amazing,positive
"A classic. If you haven't see it, you're missing out.",positive
The best movie sequence of all time at the end of the movie.,positive
"Not really much to say other than the word epic is used quite a lot these days, but in this instance it is fully deserved. The best Mafia film of all time. Period. Well The Godfather Two might just edge it, but that is just a matter of preference.",positive
The most definitive mobster movie ever! A-list stars and wonderful acting. A definite must-see if you are an Al-Pacino fan like me!,positive
the entire trilogy is so damn sick...dont watch them a day at a time...watch 'em all the way through back to back...that's the only way to really do it and get the second best experience...,positive

Mi favorita (by far),positive
I watched it when I was a kid but I still remember the story. Amazing!,positive
by far better than any of its sequels but not better than the book ofcrs,negative
Absolutely Love this movie. All time classic. You should be ashamed of yourself if you haven't seen this movie. Best mob movie ever.,positive
"Greatest mafia film of all time!! In all the directions!! Watching makes you feel and think like a member of the family ... The characters are cool. I love the bondage of the Italian families... All 1,2,3 are brilliant movies!",positive
"exact directing, incredible acting, and a screenplay to blow your mind. This is, in my opinion, the best movie ever made. The baptism scene is absoultely my favorite scene of all times.",positive
"The movie with it all mobsters, gang wars, and it's all in the family",positive
The whole trilogy is gripping viwing. The book is good too.,positive
"Very good, but it seemed to drag somewhat.",positive
I will get bashed for this dearly.,negative
"Another classic, it is slightly long but overall this is a great movie",positive
'nother kick ass movie,positive
"There is a reason this is the cliched answer to the question ""What's the greatest movie of all time?"" This movie is insane. And not just in the oh-my-god-look-there's-violence-and-cursing type way. The acting in this is out of this world. The editing, the score, the pacing. It's an absolute masterpiece.",positive
"1,2 and 3 are the greatest mafia films of all time, they probe deep into each character and explore the mafia family like no other. Brilliant acting and directing.",positive
One of the best films ever made.,positive
classic. great maffia movie,positive
I like the first two better than the last one.,positive
"Le meilleur film de Mafia EVER. Le 2e egalement. La description de la mafia la plus juste semble-t-il, un classique du genre...en fait le 1er du genre.",positive
Marlon Brando at his best !,positive
Okay I know I am not supposed to like these but for some reason i have trouble denying my self the godfather movies.,positive
"It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.",positive
who doesnt like the godfather?? :],positive
my best movie & my best stars ..,positive
The only thing bad about it is that it ends.,positive
"Perfect. I cannot praise this movie without repeating cliche, that's how great it is. A movie more interesting for its portrayal of the importance of family than its exploration of the criminal underworld, which I would argue is merely the vehicle through which the American Dream is analyzed and like all great works exploring this theme, it makes no conclusions, neither hokey nor trite about it. Brando and Pacino are brilliant and in my humble opinion, James Caan plays to perfection the role Pacino would later overact in Scarface, although they are different characters. Nino Rota's score is gorgeous and complements the images and narrative as well as the themes they explore so tightly they are inseparable in my mind. Some people prefer Part II, which I will happily grant is an excellent film, but the flawlessness and sheer emotional impact of this movie make it not only the best of the trilogy, but also one of my absolute favorites.",positive
Thow thumbs up...the only thing is sometimes you have trouble understanding the godfather,positive
Newly found appreciation. Boys I finally got it,positive
"A classic movie! Outstanding storyline, all star cast, great gangster movie.",positive
c est adorable ! just watch it ......,positive
"Fuck the hype. A long, boring film with a few splashes of red.",negative
"The story of a Mafia family who struggles to maintain their crime empire from rival families. This epic film would make Shakespeare proud seeing as Good Fellas, The Sopranos, and many more mob based dramas all spawned from this one. If you haven't seen it, do so. NOW!",positive
Greatest movie ever made. Perfection.,positive
"While critics hold the second act of this myth almost universally above its predecessor, the first Godfather film is still the most resonant. Brando's last great performance stands with Pacino's first as a mirror of a king in the wane of his rule and a son struggling to emerge from beneath him.",positive
only recently watched this for the first time - and I understand the hype. The closing scene is my favourite,positive
"Aussi fort que que toutes les mythologies Grecques ou Romaines. Un film intelligent, touchant, palpitant.",positive
"While I certainly wouldn't call this THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, this movie sure has a lot going for it, starting with the cast. I of course like Brando and Pacino going at it, but my personal faves are James Caan and of course my main man Robert Duvall. All of them give dynamite performances here, forever raising the bar to new actors everywhere. Even though the movie is 3 hours, it hardly ever drags, Coppola has a tight rein on the story (or maybe it's the producers doing that?) and it makes for a highly charged, highly entertaining classic of the first order. Funny as It seems, I only got around to finally watching this movie last year. Although I'm not exactly doing facepalms over the fact I've waited this long to see it, this movie will never grow old with me,",positive
This is one of my favorites. I just bought the whole series and only got to watch this one and i was glad. this mafia film is the original.....,positive
"Still the best of all the mafia movies. And one of Pacino's best works to this day--so understated, so simple!",positive
"Arguably the greatest movie ever made, Pacino, Brando, Duvall, and Caan each give flawless performances.",positive
Me encaaaaaaannnntttaaaaaa,positive
The one that started it all.,positive
Film doesn't get much better than this (though my fave film by Copolla is still Apocalypse Now),positive
It comes in my top 10 list,positive
"No matter how young or old you are, you HAVE to see the Godfather trilogy. The 2nd one is the best but the 1st provides all the history and background.",positive
Amazing...along with part II best movie of all time,positive
In my top 5. An amazing movie,positive
one of the best films ever made,positive
I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse...watch this movie and your horse's head will reamain on it's body.,positive
Simply the best. Period.,positive
mafi 2 7aykhtalfoo it's the best of alltimes,positive
This is mafia buiseniss on it`s best! Thumbs up all the way+++,positive
"For me, the definative mob movie.",positive
Mafia-filmen som definerte alle som skulle kome..,positive
"If you were to watch only one movie in your lifetime, make sure it is this. There's no words for the brilliance of this movie. Coppola really gets the best out of talented actors and the storyline is fascinating. Not any other mafia movies can be compared with this one - except Godfather II of course.",positive
"I can see how this was groundbreaking for its time, but I'll take the Sopranos over it anyday.",negative
"This is the king of all mafia movies and the spawner of countless imitations. I doubt that any movie is quoted more, and undoubtedly no movie appears more frequently in people's top ten list. Pacino was a flawless Michael, Caan was the perfect choice for Sonny, and could there have been a better Vito Corleone than Brando?",positive
Overrated crime drama. Boring as hell glamorization of the thugs who rape a country for money. This garbage makes me ashamed that most people love this movie.,negative
classic classic classic,positive
You have to love this movie. It's not personal. It's just business.,positive
"It's very quotable and sort of entertaining, but it's slow and far too long.",negative
Could easily be called the greatest movie of all time and by far my favorite,positive
So much greatness on screen at once. There's not enough one can say about this one.,positive
i love this!!! one of my favoties!!,positive
"Grandaddy of all mob films, and a masterpiece of epic drama",positive
non ci sono parole....,positive
This film is perfect!,positive
"This movie is about the importance and values of family. The period detail, cinematography, costumes and performances came to embody the summit of auteur craft in late 20th century American film-making (although it must be pointed out that Arthur Penn's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" may have led the way). Now, with all my 50 cent words in place, let me add that if you haven't yet seen this astonishing epic of the post-Prohibition, post-war East Coast mafia and its all-powerful Don, then you have not only a great piece of entertainment ahead of you, you'll also get a history lesson, a sociology seminar, and several dozen visceral thrills as well.",positive
"Despite all the wannabe street thugs who quote this movie, it really is great.",positive
"can watch the whole trilogy over and over again, one of the greatest movies of all times",positive
Guau!!! The one and only!!,positive
why did i wait so long to see this?? it's excellent. totally interesting for the entire movie.,positive
"Francis che Ford Coppola Ã¨ il direttore piÃ¹ grande di tutti, esso Ã¨ ingiusto affinchÃ¨ lui valuti il suo lavoro fine, la pellicola piÃ¹ grande del millennio. A meno che desideriate ottenere l'uccisione da Marlon Brando",positive
"First mafia film i saw, and was hooked from then. Brando, Pacino, James Caan, brilliant film all round",positive
The best movie ever!!,positive
Very good film - not the best in the series but still its the film that made Marlon Brando a megastar.,positive
Tam bir sinema Åaheseri. Marlon Brando ve Al Pacino harikalar. Al Pacino'nun vaftiz babalÄ±ÄÄ± yaparken bir yandan da bÃ¼tÃ¼n rakiplerini alaÅaÄÄ± etmesi mÃ¼thiÅ. Ve en sonun da kapÄ± kapanÄ±rken yeni babanÄ±n elinin Ã¶pÃ¼lmesi :),positive
"I have to say it, the most perfect film ever made. Not a weak point in it, and that includes cast, script, cinematography, music, and plot... still remains number one in my book.",positive
The best film of all times....,positive
It has to be extra-special to make it to my top10 of all time .... There is nothing much to say about this masterpiece exept to watch it.,positive
"Probably the greatest movie in terms of film making goes, but I can't watch it repeatedly.",negative
Je revois rÃ©guliÃ¨rement la sÃ©rie complÃ¨te. A chaque fois je dÃ©couvre de nouvelles choses et de nouvelles raisons d'aimer ces films.,positive
"amazing, completely gripping from start to finish",positive
the world of the mafia is quite frightening..,positive
Where do I begin...? ItÂ´s the mother of all flics,positive

This movie doesn't need commentry.,positive
Probably the best movie ever made.,positive

A classic. The greatest of all Mafia movies because it was more than just a whole lot of killing.,positive
The grand daddy of all Gangster movies. Beat this!!,positive
"Interesting, but I couldn't really, realy get into it. I mean for a crime film it's kind of slow. For me a great crime film is something faster, like Scarface or Blow, or Casino. But this one and part 2 were good. 3 sucked",positive
the mood setter to sink in the story... the true taste of the story... the atmosphere sets in this one to make the triology one of the most grasping movie experiences ever,positive
EVERY Italian has to have seen the Godfather. EVERY person on the planet should have seen this!!!! Absolutely amazing and teaches you to keep your friends close and your enimies closer!,positive
"You can't consider yourself a man until you have seen this movie. Even if you don't like it, once you see it you can consider yourself a man!",positive
my fav film (at least that is what i say when people ask),positive
There's nothing like it. Period.,positive
"pretty good, not great, but good.",negative
I know it is rare for a girl to like this movie but it is one of my all time favorites.,positive
the best mafia epic movie of all time,positive
CLASSIC MOB MOVIE FROM PART 1 TO 3,positive
"As good as the book, which is a rare one!!",positive
Fantastic. Epic. Beautiful.,positive
Fantastic. Epic. Beautiful.,positive
"Un de mes classiques (un classique tout court), Ã§a faisait longtemps que je l'avais revu et merde, Ã§a prend toujours pas une ride. Pour ceux qui ont lu le bouquin de Puzzo, c'est vraiment une excellente adaptation (il a participÃ© au film de faÃ§on active et Ã§a se sent). Marlon Brandon en Vito le vieux Don rusÃ© et usÃ© est fabuleux. Quand il joue son vieux chat vexÃ© quand le croc-mort vient lui demander une faveur, il est irrÃ©sistible. Ses interventions quand il est face Ã  ses concurrents. Sa mort dans le potager en jouant avec son petit fils... James Caan en Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone le sanguin qui rÃ©flÃ©chit pas et qui ne pense qu'Ã  trombiner tout ce qui bouge (amusante l'allusion discrÃ¨te Ã  sa particularitÃ© physique pendant le mariage en dÃ©but de film ahah). Robert Duval le cÃ©rÃ©bral discret, le consigliere d'origine germanique adoptÃ© par la famille Corleone est touchant de par son statut Ã  part. J'aime aussi beaucoup le personnage de Fredo (John Cazale), le grand frÃ¨re un peu benÃªt et influenÃ§able qui a les nerfs qui flanchent et qui sait pas s'imposer (ah la fin du Parrain 2). Et Ã©videmment, Al Pacino en Michael Corleone. La froideur, le dÃ©tachement Ã  l'Ã©tat pur. Il donne froid dans le dos car tout en retenu avant de manipuler tout le monde. Les discussions avec Brando sont excellentes, on sent Vito qui s'accroche mais Michael est dÃ©jÃ  passÃ© Ã  l'Ã©tape suivante dans sa tÃªte, il essaie juste de mÃ©nager le patriarche. On le sent avancer ses pions, avec patience, froidement (encore oui je sais), raaaah c'est bon !",positive
"great story, great acting, great directing... perfect",positive
best movie ever made,positive
I think I don't have to say anything about this movie. Everyone has seen it anyway. So full 5 Stars for this one.,positive

"I thought this is one of the best movies of all time! Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Robert Duvall do a terrific job. The plot as well as the acting has been the best I've seen in years with movies. If you ever wonder why Al Pacino is called ""the greatest actor of our generation"" watch this movie. You will understand why after you watch this movie.",positive
The ultimate classic. If you haven't already seen it...get out. Go.,positive
Who doesn't love The Godfather!!!,positive

A Tour De Force of Filmaking-John Cazale would of been remembered as the greatest actor of all time if not for his untimely death.,positive
Kommer ikke utenom denne !,positive

Ett mÃ¥ste fÃ¶r en sann filmÃ¤lskare.,positive
Alskvard. Underbar stamning rakt igenom!,positive
i dont know why most girls dont like the godfather series...,positive
"overrated by long shot. sure, it's a good film, and is ever better considering the 1970's, but nominating it the ""best movie ever"" is quite exaggerated.",negative
"One of the greats, a must-watch. Every venture into mafia drama is held up to the standards set by this and its sequel.",positive
"Al Pacino is hot. er, WAS hot. I think everyone has seen this.",positive
good movie. its classiness sets it apart from others in the gangster genre.,positive

Francis Ford Coppola and his finest work.,positive
A lot better than I thought it was going to be.,positive

the best movie of all time!,positive
it's up there in the upper echelon of film making. elegant is one way to it. i think the triumph is blending big dialogue with gritty violence. it's the ultimate cinemaphile's wet dream.,positive
Marlon Brando is the best actor ever!!!!!,positive
awesome fucking movie.,positive
"Greatest movie ever, a masterpiece",positive
It's the Godfather..nuff' said.,positive
Everybody should see this movie. It teaches you about the mafia but most important it teaches you about the loyalty and respect that your family deserves and that family always comes before anyone and anything. Blood is thicker than water. Keep your friends close but your enemies closer.,positive
"one of the best movies of all time. The story of the Mafia and how it migrated from Italy to the, how it grew, penetrated society and even the political structure. great performance by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.",positive
"Its The Godfather, come on what needs to be said?",positive
"The classic grandfather of all gangster movies! Tour de force performances from Barndo, Pacino and Duvall. This was it, it started an entire genre, including what John Woo years later. This is also Coppola's best, never to be reached again!",positive
A Masterpiece of American Cinema...,positive
an everlasting classic for sure.,positive
"One of the best movies ever made. It shows a criminal family, one that should be detested, and makes the viewer sympathize with them. One of the all-time American classics.",positive

a mster piece work by Francis F Copolla,positive
I just don't get it. And my best friend Danya would shoot me for saying so.,negative

This is one of those movies that I have to watch if I know it's on. One of the greatest films ever made. Should be required viewing.,positive

Best movie of all time,positive
"No matter what th eother people say, this film is one of the greatest films ever made. beautiful shadows on Brando's face, inexpressible emotion on Pacino's face before he kills two men in a restaurant, and the last shootout where denunciation of evil turns into blood.",positive
What can I say about perfection?,positive
my all time favourite. theaches you everything you need to know in life.,positive
"Filmmaking at it's finest,an almost perfect film!",positive
best mafia movie ever,positive
remindsss me of my family lol jk,positive
greatest movie of all time,positive
"there is very little wrong with this movie. Direction, Pacing, Cinematography, Acting, Visual Effects are all top notch. It's very long, but does a pretty good job of holding your interest. It's got a nice blend of action and emotion too. The only part I didn't like was when Sonny beat up Connie's fiance. It was so incredibly fake it really distracted from the mood the movie creates. Overall though, An excellent film.",positive
A classic. Have seen dozens of times.,positive
Pretty much perfect. Coppola is a genius. End of story.,positive
la mejor pelÃ­cula de todos los tiempos,positive
"In the Upcoming Era's If Anyone Want to Create a Modern State, The Godfather Is a Must to Be the Constitution.",positive
A well presented mafia flick that delivers drama with every act of revenge.,positive
Waited until I was 23 to watch it and then I just sort of thought it was OK. Hmmm.,negative
"It's, uh, The Godfather. 'Nuff said.",positive
"Perfect. I've heard people say the book is better, which is unfair. The book does give more details on the supporting characters and their lives (particularly Johnny Fontane) than the movie, but the movie is flawless. 1972 release and it looks like 1992. Wonderful movie. Hands down my favorite.",positive
"an almost perfect film! brilliant performances from brando, pacino and james caan! does the book justice too!",positive
Probably the greatest film there will ever be. sheer perfection,positive
Best mafia film... hands down!,positive
"Maunday, Wednesday...",positive
The greatest film ever nuf said,positive
Best of the three. Knocks spots of part 2 and part 3. Don Corleone.,positive
"Contrary to popular opinion, this is not the greatest film of all time. But it is damn good. Wonderful performances, intriguing generational tale, and slick production all mixed with a true sense of self absent in so many gangster films. It's just too bad Part II wasn't as good.",positive
The second best mob flick around.,positive
I could sit and watch this movie on repeat all day long!,positive
Watched it 10 times and it just keeps getting better!,positive
"Just an amazing movie. Brand and Pacino give a couple of great performances, and the story comes together in a great manner. You can really see the characters evolve throughout the story. The story of the prodigal son who goes from a soldier in the army to boss of the ""family business"" is great, and Coppola really does a tremendous job of capturing the personalities of each and every one of the characters. A true classic.",positive
MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!,positive
one of the best movies ever!!,positive
"Don Corleone: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
"Masterpiece of all time, no dogbt.",positive

best film ever made!!,positive
Always and forever. Sheer brilliance.,positive
The horsehead scene is still a classic.,positive
THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!! GG,positive
One of my favorites of all time.,positive
"The cast and director are numerous Academy Award winners and nominations, more than any epic film series in history. More importantly, it has moulded the status of legendary actors like Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Robert De Niro, Andy Garcia, Diane Keaton, and of course, the late Marlon Brando.",positive
"Classic filmmaking that elevated a genre picture to a piece of art. Brando steals every scene he's in, but this movie is carried by Pacino and one of the most patient, conservative performances I've ever seen.",positive
simply the best part of the best trilogy ever. best cast ever assembled? probably? definitely!,positive
Grym film helt enkelt...,positive
"my all time fav.. superb performance..awesome script,screenplay,direction..fripping deadly,satrical.. its got everything with a touch of class from Coppola",positive
It'd been my not-so-secret shame for years that I'd not seen this movie. It's captivating to the fullest and absolutely phenomenal.,positive
A masterpiece. End of story.,positive
"There is little to add to the comments on this message board and numerous other sources- The Godfather is simply the best movie released. Not ""Best Gangster Movie"", not ""Best Mafia Movie""- there are no qualifiers needed. The movie captures so many elements of great cinema- story, casting, writing, direction, production qualities, that it rises above every other movie released. See this movie and marvel at the transformation of Michael Corleone, the intensity of Sonny, the ineptness of Fredo, the emptiness of Connie and how Tom Hagen calculates every move, always looking for the acceptance from the rest of the family. Vito Corleone is a study of cunning abilities. The family looks to him for guidance and advice, even while the world is moving so quickly to overtake them.",positive
A classic mafia movie! Great!,positive
no question the greatest in movie history,positive
I love Al Pacino....he's so charming!!!!,positive
"The perfect film ....epic, rich in content, story, cast, direction... bet you even the catering rock'd. Ain't luck, that you always see this film up there in the top 10 films ever made...",positive

"One of the greatest films made in an otherwise mediocre Hollywood. This one is a master class in acting, photography, music and direction.",positive
The Godfather faqat la ghayr....,positive

One word: greatestofalltime,positive
MakalÃ¶st men mÃ¥ste ses i kombination med tvÃ¥an...VarfÃ¶r kÃ¤nns det inte i magen pÃ¥ samma sÃ¤tt lÃ¤ngre. Ser framfÃ¶r mig nÃ¤r Michael ska skjuta den korrumperade snuten pÃ¥ syltan och grÃ¤ver fram pistolen bakom vattenklosetten samtidigt som tÃ¥get dundrar fÃ¶rbi. MakalÃ¶st.,positive

"Hands down, greatest movie of all time.",positive
"it's not personal, it's business.",positive
"It's easy to see why this is considered the great work of American film -- everything about it radiates competence and an epic quality. But beneath the veneer, it doesn't have much emotional weight or psychological complexity. We never really get inside Michael Corleone's head, and the result is a movie that inspires neither affection nor admiration.",negative
Excellent film. Marlon Brando is superb.,positive
Great in every aspect.,positive
A great mix of ass-kickery and serious drama. Makes me proud to be italian.,positive
What is there really to say?,positive
CLASSIC BRANDO AND A YOUNG AL PACINO A EPIC TALE OF A GREAT A POWERFULL MOB FAMILY IN THE 1940s (THE DON),positive
Budder bing budder bang. All three were outstanding.,positive
The greatest movie of all time.,positive
"a bible... the best movie ever! great actors, great plot... simply amazing!",positive
"Simply put, this is the best mob film ever made, Al Pacino has one of the most interesting and tragic character arcs ever; first hes the good American, then he begins a viscious path towards his marriage to the mob, and Marlon Brando brings it home.",positive
always wanna review it,negative
The Godfather. Need i say more?,positive
I actually prefer this one rather than the sequel...,positive
"Wonderful movie, awesome story line. Family always comes first, even for the mafia.",positive
no explanation needed,positive
Un clasico!!! muy buena y no pasa de moda!,positive
It is as good as the book. I suggest watching it.,positive
"Buena, me encanta la frase de'hare una oferta que no podra rehusar'",positive
"Another film that gets better every time you watch it. All of the important aspects are there; in particular, there is amazing acting from the whole cast. The whole plot is one that continues to captivate me; for some reason I tend to appreciate movie plots that have a heavy element of tragedy, and this one has a fair amount of that (the tragedy continues to escalate in the other films in the series as well). Basically, this is a movie that everyone should watch.",positive
It's a great American classic that has become absolutely entrenched in our culture. This film has every element that great cinema needs.,positive
This is the best of the saga. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are great. One of the few long movies that I like,positive
"The definitive mafia movie. Can't say nothing much. Great script, great directing job, great cast. Fascinating view of the italian mob in the 40's.",positive
"The Ultimate crime movie of the century, Marlynn Brando plays an outstanding godfather. Great reproduction of Mario puzo's novel.",positive
"Indeed one of the top 10 most amazing films ever made!!! It nails everything; acting, writing, visuals, directing, and music! Wonderful!!!",positive
"If you like to see movies, you should love Godfather. if you don't you- bekieve me- you have a big taste problem",positive
"Though this may bot have all the blood and gore in most mob movies, it still delivers a fine story with a more realistsic feel to it.",positive
a tale of a ancient and dying moral code,positive
og and when i say og i mean og,positive
The greatest mafia film ever made. Nothing but The Godfather II even comes close.,positive
"A good film, although, it is possible that it may be slightly overrated.",negative
best movie of all time,positive
best movie ever made!!!,positive
"the best movie I've ever seen, and I doubt to see better..",positive
"'Someday, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me.'",positive
Michael Corleone is one sexy man!,positive
"My problem is that I read the book first, so I've never quite been able to shake off some of the gaps between my imagination and the portrayals on screen. Who on earth cast James Caan as Sonny?! I KNOW it's considered one of the best films of all time, and can totally see why, but there's just something missing for me.",positive
"al pacino is great, marlon brando is great everybody and everything is great....a masterpiece",positive
"There's a reason that this is the mafia film everybody remembers. Chronicling the Corleone crime family, the film follows ""good son"" Michael Corleone as he finds himself forced to give up the straight life to follow in his father's footsteps. This is a marvelous film with a terrific cast. The story is great and proceeds at a nice clip. Without a doubt this film is a classic and it deserves that status.",positive
"From the bestseller of Mario Puzo...what can you say if not just ""Great""!",positive
violence can be beauty,positive
The movie is just amazing. One of the best films I have ever seen.,positive
"absolutely brilliant, absolutely...",positive
I loved this movie from the begining,positive
Excellent cast and a masterpiece!,positive
"""Why you show me no respect?"" ""cos you're a cunt with cotton wool in his mouth"" is what I would've replied if fat boy Marlon Brando asked me! Absolute shit 1star.",positive
Den enda sanna maffiatrilogins fÃ¶rsta film - toppenbra som tÃ¥l att ses om och om och om igen av trogna Corleone fans.,positive
um...anyone who has not seen this movie really needs to set their priorities straight...seen it 20 times and counting,positive
classic americana gangster film,positive
"very memorable film! loved all the classic scenes, twists in the plot are very engaging, and the italian family passion was very moving. Al pacino is charming!",positive
A once in a lifetime cast with a near perfect script combined with peerless direction. It is just an absolutely magnificent experience.,positive
best movie ever! nuff said.,positive
"I mean , COME THE F**** on and I never swear, but this",positive
"The ultimate, never to be surpassed, family crime drama. Some of the best cinematography ever!!!",positive
I watched it about a million times on Bravo and I never get tired of it.,positive
love all the godfathers especially the bit with the horses head,positive
I've tried watching it twice. It's too boring.,negative
"An involving story that attaches you to the characters, allowing you to be moved or at least interested when things happen to them. A masterpiece of storytelling, and a wonderful display of the cool and calm style Al Pacino can play.",positive
The only movie which did complete justice to a masterpiece of a book!!! an awesome example of how a blend of geniuses in the film industry can result in one of the finest movies to have ever been made...,positive
Perfection cinÃ©matographique,positive
la puedo ver milo veces y siempre me parece interesante,positive
"This is a film that depicts a true family. One that does so through the eyes of the itlaian mafia. An exquisite depection, makes you think about family, honour, pride and friends in a defferent light. key quote ""a man that has no family is not a man"" and ""never let your enemies no what you are thinking""",positive
"An impeccable ensemble cast, a flawless screenplay, riveting performances and perfect direction. One of the very best films of all time, the Godfather manages to retain a classic feel despite being shot in the 1970s.",positive
The best trilogy ever. This is one that can be watched five thousand times and every time you learn something different.,positive
one of the best fillms ever made,positive
simply the best!!!!!,positive
look how they massacred my boy,positive
Nothing can compare to this masterpiece - a work of inspired genius. The best movie I've ever seen. Awesome.,positive
"most likely the best movie of all time, rivaled only by Godfather II.",positive
"another all time favorite. go on anyway review site that compiles all reviews and grades a movie. this on is number one everytime.btw, how the hell doesnt this have a perfect rating on here?! 58% not interested, IDIOTS",positive
"Wow, love this film, even better when you've been to the place where some of the trilogy was shot!",positive
"i dont understand anyone that hasnt seen this film...fantastic - Brando was great...all of them were fantastic..love James Caan, love all of them....do slightly prefer number 2...buts its close and its a shame to compare the 2....",positive
The most classic movie i have ever seen. the most unforgettable scene to me is Al Pasino took the gun from the water closet of the toilet and went out to shoot quickly.,positive
The first is the best!,positive
Marlon and his speech...,positive
En odÃ¶dlig karaktÃ¤r som Marlon Brando gestaltar och som hÃ¶jer filmen till 5 stjÃ¤rnor nÃ¤stan sjÃ¤lv. Tops =)!,positive
Watched 1 to 3 the other week highly recommended,positive
The greatest movie of all-time,positive
A film that no-one could fail to appreciate.,positive
So good that I actually started dressing and acting like a '40s mafioso for a good couple of months.,positive
"What can you say about this, that hasn't been said in the past. This and Chapter 2 are the best films ever. They will never be surpassed.",positive
Classic! the soundtrack is awesome!,positive

The greatest gangster movie ever made.,positive
Greatest movie ever made.....ever!,positive
Marlon Brando is unforgettable in this movie.,positive
MASTERPIECE. and yes the ending is perfect...if thats possible. =),positive
"The closest I've seen to a complete package. Soundtrack is awesome. Casting is amazing (James Caan was great). Story is incredible, especially for an adaptation. The Godfather is quite possibly the greatest movie ever made, at least in my book. Massacre scene during the baptism is pure art.",positive
"Only saw this for the first time recently, but brilliantly put together film - lovin' Brando in this.",positive
The best gangster/mafia film ever. The second best is Part 2. Truly breathtaking.,positive
This film has to be in the all time top ten of the world,positive
No comment neccessary,positive
"The ONLY movie that is closest to the book.. the book though, is better.",positive
I was surprised that this movie kept me interested throughout the movie. I liked a lot of the undertones of hidden evil and corruption.,positive
I adore it. It's really something like my life story. I keep everything about it all.,positive
An enduring classic - It's a pity others in the franchise couldn't match the standard,positive
"First off, this movie is ballin'. secondly he is soooooo sexy",positive
One of the greatest trilogie ever made,positive
Superb film very well made and not too cliche,positive
"The best Mafia movie EVER besides ""The untouchable""! Pure classic Italian gangster's.",positive
"I can see why it is such a highly regarded film, but it just didn't do much for me :|",negative
"amazing!!!!!! just like star wars, lord of the rings, and the occasional chick flick. you need to see it",positive
nothing needs to be said.,positive
"everything we can say about this movie has been said already, we're talking about a classic everybody must see.",positive
Great acting and the BEST ENDING EVER. Seriously. Watch it. You don't have to have huge explosions at the end of a movie to make a huge impact. Genius.,positive
"who doesint love this movie, its a classic that everyone has watched!",positive
the only time I ever liked Pacino. a great film.,positive
"""This is the business we have chosen.""",positive
The best gangster film. PERIOD.,positive
"Classic!!! LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! Great acting, classic plot and lots of fighing.",positive
rhe classic. it doesn't get much better than this.,positive
I can never get enough of this movie. It is one of my favorites along with the whole trilogy.,positive
Literally God's gift to man!,positive
"The incessantly-acclaimed masterpiece, The Godfather may well deserve its title. As if the novel basis weren't enough, the prime performances of Caan and Brando, as well as the breakout roles of Pacino and DuVall- The cool, demure scene lighting- The long, drawn-out orchestral score that slinks and slithers- The depth of character... The Godfather is an immortal classic, to say the least, and its acclaim only falters in the newer generation of filmgoers.",positive
Cotton Ball stock soared through the roof after brando's gripping portrayal of a bulldog don.,positive
Perfect in every way.,positive
"Epic and intimate at the same time, The Godfather is a very long movie that never slows down and never feels boring. Marlon Brando won the Oscar (and deservedly so), but Al Pacino's performance as his successor is the one to watch. Countless classic scenes & lines. One of the most influential movies of the 20th Century.",positive
"Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and Robert Duvall.....Forget about it",positive
REally really like this movie...it's one I can watch over and over again. Al Pacino is another one of my fave actors.,positive
"Absolutely the best mafia movie ever-- nothing compares! It is also one of the best movies I have ever seen... The cast is excellent and the plot is superb and doesn't have any holes in it. I would probably give it 5 stars but I saw the TV version, so when I see the unedited movie, I will update.",positive
"great movie, everyone should definitely see this movie",positive
OMG. Best Movie Ever.,positive
Who doesn't love this one?,positive
This film created an entirely new visual style that was back by so many strong performances. It's a classic; I don't need to say anything else about the Godfather.,positive
Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is a true cinematic gem. Such wonderful performances and a real...atmosphere.,positive
literally the best thing ever.,positive
"A true classic, stays very true to the book, which was a good read, the film is a 5 star.",positive
La mejor pelicula jamas..,positive
The best movie for the best book!!!!,positive
One of the Greatest Gangster Films,positive
Some scenes that have defined the genre...but I am alone on this I know...I don't care for it.,negative
"A classic!!! On everybody's top 10 list, if not, it should be...",positive
"Okay, if you're a guy and you've never seen this...nay, you don't LOVE this movie, wipe off your lipstick and go get this. Never seen it before? Don't care...buy it immediately...your masculinity will thank me.",positive
"AMC rates it best American movie of all time, who am I to say different?",positive
"Can't say much about this film that hasn't already been said. Most peoples favourite but that don't mean it ain't great, which it certainly is.",positive
I base my life off the teachings of Pacino and Brando!,positive
Sonny was the man...,positive
Amazing story. I like more violence only reason i didnt give it a perfect. But as far as plot perfect,positive
"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""",positive
"You can't not give the godfather 5 stars. at least not the first one. One of the more authentic movies about organized crime. brando, of course, is amazing, and the early pacino shows that even a relatively young actor can deliver the acting strength of an older, more experienced one.",positive
Nearly as good as Scarface!,positive
"Simplemente la mejor pelicula de la historia, y la que mÃ¡s veces he visto.",positive
"Starring one of hollywood's ever best actors, Marlon Brandon. An all time classic movie and defenetly a five on my scale.",positive
"Pretty good, but I just don't see why it is regarded so highly.",negative
One of the milestones in the history of cinema.,positive
"No hay mejor pelicula sobre la mafia, es buenisima.",positive
"Just the greatest movie of all time. Fantastic cast, cinematogrophy is perfectly pitched to the subject matter and above all fantastic script!",positive
"Just the greatest movie of all time. Fantastic cast, cinematogrophy is perfectly pitched to the subject matter and above all fantastic script!",positive
"amo esta pelicula... es lo mejor que he podido ver, leer, etc...",positive
The best film ever made!!!!!,positive
"This is the best movie ever produced, written and acted. I will always hunt for a film with more quality, but I expect I shall remain dissapointed. This film emits an aura of raw power. Beautiful, gorgeous and clean. A work of art that is both life changing and awesome in depth and perspective. Do not go out and see this one, let it consume and excite you. It is an event to see.",positive
just one of the best damn movies ever made,positive
"One of the best Book into film adaptations, kept it true and the casting brave whilst on the money. Just wonderful throughout",positive
Another great series collection,positive
what can i say? one of the best movies ever.,positive
"Anyone who hasnt seen this film needs to. Absolutly one of the best movies of all time, anyone who gives it less than 5 out of 5 is a fool.",positive
if you dont like this movie you dont know what real movie is,positive
"The best script is ""Keep your friend close, and keep your enemy closer.""",positive
by far..the best movie ever made,positive
"""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse."" Three Untouchable Hours, worth every minute.",positive
"I guess this just wasn't my style, but I can see why others would like it.",negative
Darn good mobster movie!,negative
Epic mafia story. Pacino depiction of soldier turning mob leader is the business.,positive
"All time classic, it took me time to get into the Godfather series, but once I did I felt part of the Corleones",positive
"This movie is not only about power, it is also about vulnerability. The combined performance of Marlon Brando is what earned him the Oscar.",positive
The standard by which all trilogies should be judged. Classic,positive
The quintessential gangster flick. I enjoyed Al Pacino's turn from pacifist Marine to a savagely cruel Don.,positive
An unforgettable classic. A flawless masterpiece.,positive
This film needs no review. Just watch and learn.,positive
"I thought before this movie is not for me but when i started watching it, i grabbed the part II after.",positive
IT THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE,positive
Perhaps the best american film of all time. Pure genius.,positive
Sans commentaires...,positive
"ugh this movie sucks!!! just kidding, its def. top 3 greatest of all time, if not numero uno, classic mob film that doesn't overdo it like todays mob movies",positive
"Ingen snack om att det hÃ¤r Ã¤r vÃ¤rldens abslut BÃSTA FILM. Har du inte sett den sÃ¥ vet du inte ett smack om film,eller filmhistoria!",positive
"Genius, but lets face it, everyone says that",positive
"excellent atmospheric movie, brando is all power and pacino shows what a fresh new face to the world of film should be like.",positive
"The godfather is not a bad picture, i belive that it is overrated by the massmedia. No doubt about it that itÂ´s a classic but still the book was better!!",negative
Marvellous acting and a chilling build-up make for a classic package.,positive
Genious! Not necessary to add anyting else.,positive
"The saga may have lost it's spark with part III but the first two still stand out as movie making at it's finest. The epic storyline, attention to detail, dialogue, plot, score and of course top class acting from a list of Hollywood heavyweights reaped Oscars by the basket for those involved and rightly so. There are to many scenes to pick out for particular attention but almost anyone of them with Brando in is worth watching to get a feel for the magnetism he exudes in it. Grab a few Pizza's and some wine and watch them both.",positive
Brando is magnificent. It should have been even longer. The music is great.,positive
"Screw Part II, screw Goodfellas, this is it. You know why so many people say this is the best mob film? Because it is. Marlon Brando...that's all I have to say. I don't think I need to explain why it's the best.",positive
"If there was only one movie we can watch in the world, this will have to be it",positive
Best 70's Mafia Movie.Must see,positive
My favourite movie- or top 10 at least. Also a GREAT book,negative
Coppola's film is sheer genius. Marlon Brando has that air of sheer power and brilliance about him whenever he takes to the screen.,positive
An offer you won't refuse... must-see one. Al Pacino's best performance ever!,positive
The first and the best. Love it!,positive
"no more words,it's just the greatest film ever made!",positive
"One of the Greatest films ever made, probably the first ever masterpiece",positive
i would like to give this one a five star but my all time favourite is Amadeus. but this is the second best movie i ever seen.,positive
Classis-Marlon Brando top of my list always.,positive
"BÃSTA filmen nÃ¥gonsin, enligt mÃ¥nga. Perfekt miljÃ¶, gÃ¶r sÃ¥ att man nÃ¤stan kan leva sig in i historien om denna underbart brutala maffia historien.",positive
"Like a craved bag of your favorite potato chips, you can't eat just one. You cannot watch The Godfather without watching the whole saga. The best film ever made. Period.",positive
"This is one of the best 1940's gangster film.Guns,loyalty and betrayal, this film has it all. Intresting side note, the director, Francis Ford Coppola is related to Nicholas Cage",positive
My third favorite movie of all time. As a fellow Italian we are issued this movie in the mail. Im a big fan of acting and story line and Coppola has made a Masterpiece,positive
One of the best movies ever.,positive
amazing movie!!!!!!!!,positive
I finally watched the first two Godfather movies...and I was really blown away by the old world charm in this one.,positive

What more could you possibly want from a movie?,positive
classic. classic. classic.,positive
"How many times have I seen this movie.. Not enough!! I could watch this over and over again. This is when I fell in love with Al Pacino and knew I would have to have a ""bad boy"" of my very own!!",positive
"An American classic capturing nearly every genre in a composed, gripping manor. Unforgettable.",positive
Greatest Movie Ensemble ever. Greatest Film Ever. Perfect Film.,positive
Quite possibly the greatest film ever made. A true study on the human being and what makes him who he is. Amazing in every since of the word.,positive
Nothing to be said just shut up and watch,positive
This is the longest film that I never mind watching over and over again. The benchmark in American cinema.,positive
suberb. breathtaking . 2hands and 2 legs up.,positive
It's a movie about family. It's a movie about the American Dream. It's a classic.,positive
An absolute classic. The standard by which any mafia movie is judged,positive
Watch all 3 of these and then never watch another mob movie again.,positive
"Is fittingly labeled the greatest movie of all time. Set 's the bar for all films ever made, shot, acted, directed to perfection.",positive
This is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made. I have seen this movie countless ties and always get something out of it.,positive
Think they bin on the gary ablets! haha,negative
"""you come to me on the day of my annuel clown fight day....."" classic quoteation. .... i think ha!",positive

"a classic , what else can I say!",positive
The all-time best mobster movies ever. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are exceptional.,positive
"This is the very best film in the history of films. Marlon Brando has that air of sheer power and brilliance about him whenever he takes to the screen. Every single character brings raw emotion into the story. I thought the book was great, but really, this movie is even better. Maybe it's because Al Pacino was in it. Basically, this is always going to be in my top 3 movies of all time, always.",positive
"I guess this is a main stream favorite, and I agree that it is one of the best movies made. I think that for the time it was made, it was ground-breaking in terms of content as well as production. I don't know much to appreciate the production value of the movie, but the acting and the scenes seem flawless.",positive
ONE OF THE BEST FLIMS EVER.......,positive
"Unrivaled, even today.",positive
Seen this movie for years and i still love it.,positive

"One of the best movies of all time. One of my favorites (dang, I forgot to put it there). My narrative strategies class just had a screening of this last Wednesday, and for good reason.",positive

BEST TRILOGY EVER....,positive
"For those who haven't seen it already, do it - just as important as reading Shakespeare, or passing your exams - the story of the Criminal Biziness through several eras, with Biziness being the operative word....Nuff said, Marlon Brando is impeccable as Don Vittorio Corleone....",positive

"after seeing the restoration, i'm tempted to change my rating to five stars, but will keep it at 4.5. to see it on the big screen was an eye opening experience- so much of the film is in darkness and shadow and there were so many little things I had forgotten after repeated viewings via cable, video, etc. So glad I took the time to watch again, now onto The Godfather II.",positive
Not the greatest movie ever made. But still one of the greatest movies ever made.,positive
"I liked this movie. It's a good story of a single man's transformation into the crime world. Plus, it's easy to get involved in the world of all the characters. No wonder this movie's a classic.",positive
The only weakness is the turning of Michael - a bit too much of one sec to the next,positive
Come on... great old classic.,negative
