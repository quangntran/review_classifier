# NLP and SVM to Classify RottenTomatoes Reviews

This project explores text classification. Since I really love The Godfather II, I decided to use its reviews for this project. I wrote a script to automate scraping reviews of a movie from [rottentomatoes.com](rottentomatoes.com). I also implemented SVM using CVXPY package and apply it to text classification.
